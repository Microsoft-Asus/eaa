  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="EXTENDING SYMPATHY TO BRAZIL IN WAKE OF PLANE CRASH TRAGEDY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, last evening the airport at Sao Paolo, Brazil was a scene of a terrible tragedy that took the lives of as many as 200 people. Among those lost was a member of the Chamber of Deputies, Representative Julio Redecker, the Brazilian House minority leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As fate would have it, many of us here today were scheduled to have a meeting with him and the President of the Chamber of Deputies here in the Capitol. Of course, the tragedy in Brazil and the loss of Representative Redecker changed those plans, very sadly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moments ago I spoke with the Brazilian President of the Chamber of Deputies, Arlindo Chinaglia; and Brazil's Ambassador to the United States, Antonio Patriota. I conveyed to them the deepest sympathy of the Members of the House of Representatives to the people of Brazil, to the family of Representative Redecker. They were, I think, very comforted by the fact that I told them that later today, now, we would have a moment of silence and extend our sympathy to the people of Brazil for the terrible  loss of 200 people and, of course, the special sympathy to our friend in the Chamber of Deputies and to the family of Representative Redecker for the loss of the minority leader of that important chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask that the House observe a moment of silence in remembrance of Julio Redecker and all of those who lost their lives in Brazil yesterday evening.</paragraph>

  <chair>PERSONAL EXPLANATION&lt;ul&gt;</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I regret that due to a sudden illness I missed rollcall vote No. 630 through vote no. 655. Had I been present, I would have voted "yea" on rollcall votes 630, 631, 632, 633, and 634. I would have voted "no" on rollcall votes 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, and 655.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>The unanimous-consent agreement under which we are now operating means that there will be at least 13 hours of debate on amendments that are contemplated being offered. In addition to the 13 hours that that will take, you almost have to allow for 4 or 5 hours of slippage because of the time it takes for recognition and things like that. So that means that we will have approximately 18 hours, not counting votes, as I calculate it, to dispose of all of the items contained in the unanimous  consent request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members further need to understand that we will not be on this bill tomorrow morning because the Appropriations Committee has to mark up the Agriculture appropriation bill. That means that if we stay here until 1 o'clock tonight, we might, if we get lucky and if some people decide to drop some amendments, be finished by 8 or 9 o'clock tomorrow night. I wish that we could do it sooner, but I'm not the fellow offering the amendments. So I simply want Members to be aware of what it means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we will try to do, and I don't think this is definitely tied down, but Members should be notified shortly when it is, we will try to go until about 8 o'clock and then have another series of votes.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this would basically eliminate funding for the Byrd Honors Scholarship program by saving about $40.6 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I guess what I'm here to talk about today, Mr. Chairman, is that this program, which is certainly a merit-based scholarship program, was rated as "results not demonstrated." When we talk about funding, when we talk about scholarships, when we talk about trying to make government more effective and more efficient, I think this is a perfect example, Mr. Chairman, of duplicative services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the need of helping our high school seniors, and I applaud the effort. But in a time when money is scarce and we're trying to be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollar, doesn't it make sense, Mr. Chairman, to take programs like this, and all other associated programs, take a look at them from the bottom up and look at what is effective?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why was this particular program rated "results not demonstrated"? Was it because of a lack of funding, Mr. Chairman? Was it because of a lack of information that high school students didn't know what was going on? Was it because of a lack of organization on how the scholarship is administered? I don't know. I don't know these answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all I'm saying is, if we're going to continue to help seniors, and I hope we do, let's try to do it in a more responsible manner. Let's just not create another government program. Let's not create a duplicative service. Let's take a look at what we're doing, how we're doing it, bring things together. It may be that this program needs to be increased, I don't know. It may be that it needs to go away and this money go to a program that is far more effective. All I'm saying is that I think this  is the wrong way to go about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think if we took a real hard look at all these programs, we could pull our  resources together, we could help our high school seniors much more effectively and maybe, at the same time, save $40.6 million of hard-earned taxpayers' money.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if you think that there is too much education in this country, then vote for this amendment. If you think that we could use more help to people trying to get an education, then you vote against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that the only thing wrong with this program in the eyes of the White House is the name of the man that's attached to the program, the distinguished Senator ROBERT BYRD from West Virginia. He sponsored this program, which provides needs-based scholarships all over the country, some 15,000 of them. I happen to think that's a good thing. I think the recipients certainly think it's a good thing. I think the working families of the recipients think it's a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman says that the White House Budget Office has ranked this program as "not determined" in terms of effectiveness. I would remind you, this is the same White House that is claiming that the surge in Iraq has shown great progress. I hardly think that their judgment ought to serve as the standing judgment of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also note, by the way, that the White House also ranks as "effectiveness not being determined" IDEA preschool grants, and IDEA Grants for Infants and Families. We've had several efforts on the part of people on that side of the aisle today to increase funding for IDEA. I didn't see them stopping then because the White House didn't think that was such a hot idea. I also see the White House ranks the Federal Work Study program as being "not determined" in terms of adequacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all due respect, I think this country needs all the education it can get. I think it needs all the student aid it can get. And I would therefore urge rejection of the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to correct the chairman. This is a merit-based program, not a need-based program.</paragraph>

Can it not be rolled into another program or taken a look at to make sure that we're getting our best bang for the dollar, that we're spending the taxpayers' money wisely, and we're being the most effective helping our high school seniors with a higher education degree?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Obey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee, Mr. Obey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today my goal is to draw attention to the backlog of applications for disability benefits at the Social Security Administration. Today, more than 1.3 million Americans are awaiting a decision on their disability cases. SSA is staffed with dedicated, hard-working employees, but due to staffing shortages at the agency, some applicants for disability benefits must wait as long as 3 or 4 years before receiving a decision on their case. Many of these individuals are severely ill or injured,  cannot work or have little or no income or access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American workers pay into the Social Security system with the promise that if they become severely disabled, Social Security will be there for them. Today we are falling far short on that promise. This situation is a direct result of the understaffing of the Social Security Administration in recent years. Other important programs under the Labor, Health and Human Services bill have also been underfunded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given these competing needs, I greatly appreciate the chairman's efforts and the committee's effort to include additional funding for SSA in this year's bill. Nonetheless, I believe we should strive to do better in conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I share the gentleman's concern about the Social Security disability claim backlog and the hardship it has caused. Under the President's request for SSA, the disability backlog has gotten worse. The funding increase we've included in this bill will keep that from happening and will protect SSA from staffing declines that the agency has seen in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would make the point that despite the fact that we were left in a considerable mess with all of last year's domestic appropriation bills not passed when we took over, we still made SSA a priority and included $148 million over the 2006 funding level. In the bill we are debating today, we have included over $401 million above the 2007 level and $100 million more than the presidential request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to work with the gentleman and others, such as Mr. Arcuri, toward increasing the amount for SSA in the conference and in future years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400268" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to Chairman Obey that, DAVE, I approached you on this earlier in the year. Your response was immediate and positive. You have provided the additional funding. We hope to get more in conference. But what you have done is going to accrue to the benefit of thousands and thousands of Americans who have been waiting a long, long time for these decisions. On their behalf, I thank you.</paragraph>

  <chair>Page 90, line 7, further increase the first dollar amount by $25,000,000.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is no Member of this House that I respect more than the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Obey. He has the toughest job in this body: To chair the full Appropriations Committee, to carry one of the largest bills and to do such a superb job at reconciling the interests of 435 Members of this body from all corners of the Nation. So it is with great regret, Mr. Chairman, that I rise to offer any amendment to this bill. But the need is great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically Black Colleges and Universities all across America need help, and they need help now. And the chairman, to his credit, provides help. He upped the amount by $11 million to $249 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. He also has some $57 million for Historically Black Graduate Schools. But, Mr. Chairman, I suggest that is not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my amendment would add $125 million to these marvelous institutions. It is about a 40 percent increase instead of a 4 percent increase in their funding. I would take this money from the Department of Education, their administrative fund. I will admit this is not my favorite place to get the money. But under the rules, I have to get the money at a place in the bill after page 90.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my intent is this: To give HBCUs, Historically Black Institutions, higher priority and much higher funding. I trust the discretion of the Appropriations Committee to get that money from an appropriate place in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague from Memphis, Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Davidson County for yielding and for bringing this amendment. There is still a critical need in this country for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my communities, the finest public school students traditionally are desirous of going to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We try to keep them in Tennessee with HOPE scholarships. We offer from $4,000 to $5,500 a year to stay in Tennessee. There are fine Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Lemoyne-Owen in my district, Fisk in Nashville, and Knoxville College up in East Tennessee. But most of them want to go out of State and go to Atlanta and come to this area to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities. It is still the first choice for most African American students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to fund these schools at a higher level. They have not received increased funding over the last 5 or 6 years to speak of. The need has become greater and greater. These are students who need educational opportunities to move out and into the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the gentleman from Davidson County for bringing this amendment, I am pleased to support it, and ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to see this great need which will help people who have not had an opportunity to share in the American dream as much as they should.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400081" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, these are marvelous Historically Black Institutions and today they serve a wide spectrum, people of all races and backgrounds. But, most importantly, so many of these students are first-generation college students. They deserve a chance to live the American dream; to become the doctors, the lawyers, the artists, the poets, the engineers and the scientists of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These institutions serve a vital role in our society. As the gentleman from Memphis pointed out, their funding has essentially been frozen for the last 4 or 5 years. To offer them only a 4 1/2  percent increase this year is good, but it is not enough. That is why I think we need to reach deep, to increase the funding substantially, so that they know that the year 2007 was the year in which they saw a dramatic increase as opposed to the prior year of funding freeze.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Obey. My wish is not to add to the difficulty of his task. But so many of these institutions are teetering on the edge. They need help, they need help now, and they need large amounts of help. That is why we have offered this amendment to increase funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities by $125 million. Please support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is no Member of this Congress I admire more than Chairman OBEY. He has the toughest job in Congress, to lead the entire Appropriations Committee, to carry the single largest appropriations bill of $153 billion, and to reconcile the needs and desires of 435 Members of Congress from all corners of the Nation. Another reason the job is so tough is that Chairman OBEY also has to listen to more blather than anyone else in Congress. So it is with great regret that  I rise to offer any amendment to his handiwork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would increase the funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and for historically Black graduate schools by $125 million. The chairman's mark already includes $249.5 million for these schools and $57 million for HBGLs, so my amendment offers a  40-percent increase in HBCU funding. My amendment would take that funding from the Department of Education Departmental Management Program Administration Account. I would agree that this is perhaps not the ideal source of funding,  but due to procedural rules that limited me to finding offsets after page 90 in the bill, that is the best I was allowed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My intent is to give higher priority--and much higher funding--to historically Black colleges, universities, and graduate schools, and that their increase in funding be offset in ways that the Appropriations Committee deems most appropriate in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key point is to boost these marvelous historically Black institutions. Most of these schools were born soon after the Civil War and have served America well by training the doctors, lawyers, scientists, poets, business people, professors, engineers, etc. that America needs. Today they serve Blacks, Whites, and a wide range of other races and ethnic backgrounds. Many of these students are first-generation college students trying to live the American dream by getting a good education and a  good job. I have the honor of representing three of these institutions in Nashville: Fisk University, Meharry Medical College, Tennessee State University, as well as American Baptist College. But there are dozens of historically black colleges scattered over dozens of States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman's mark already gives these historically Black institutions a 4.5 percent increase. I appreciate that, but I cannot help but notice that, after 4 years of no increase in Federal funding, that 4.5 percent is not enough to do the job, in fact, it's not enough to even offset the effects of inflation. These historically Black colleges, universities, and graduate schools need more of an increase than that--much more--to continue their extraordinary mission of reaching the poor, minorities,  and the disenfranchised of all races, and to help them get the education they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please support the C ooper amendment to increase Federal aid to historically Black colleges and universities. This is your chance to make sure that everyone has a better chance to  live the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment, like so many others offered today, demonstrates that the White House is incredibly off base when they tell us that this bill is over-funded. This bill is about 2.5 percent in real terms above last year. The fact that it is so tight and still falls so short of meeting many needs is evidenced by the fact that we have this kind of amendment before us. The only difference between this amendment and several others is that the others have been coming from the  minority side of the aisle and this one happens to come from the majority side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me simply say that I fully appreciate where the gentleman wants to put the money. It is a good place to put it. There are many other good places to put it. The problem is that it is simply not real to believe that you can decimate the administrative budget of the Department of Education as much as this amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to ask people to vote one way or another on this, because no matter which way you vote, you will be wrong, because this amendment, because of the squeeze that we are in, because of the tremendous demand for education help in this country, no matter what you do, someone will be shortchanged. It is either the department that is supposed to administer the programs or the programs themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I sympathize with what the gentleman is trying to do. I cannot honestly say I endorse the amendment, because of the problems, but I think the gentleman's amendment lays out clearly how inadequate this bill still is in terms of meeting the country's responsibilities, especially to those folks in our population who are not, shall we say, the top dogs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank you, first of all, for your support of Historically Black Colleges and Universities over the years. In subcommittee I know we did increase this a significant amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman's amendment which he has presented today is worthy of consideration. I just want to say why, as a person from California, Historically Black Colleges and Universities are important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, the Governor of the State of California ended affirmative action. Very few African American and Latino students now are able to attend the University of California, and that is a tragedy. What we have found is that the majority of African American students now are going from California to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. They have saved the day for our young people in California. So I am very clear on what may or may not happen. I look forward to working with you  and the chairman as we go to conference on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I just want to say on behalf of those African American students in California, that they need as many opportunities as they can get because of what happened in terms of the decimation of equal opportunity programs and initiatives that would allow them into the University of California.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today with the gentleman from Tennessee, my good friend, Mr. Wamp, for the purpose of engaging the chairman in this colloquy about the National Youth Sports Program. While my purpose for rising today is to discuss the merits of NYSP, I would also like to commend the chairman on the work that the committee has done in crafting such a respectable bill before us. The subcommittee was able to restore several programs that otherwise would have been eliminated, while also  increasing important investments in much-needed areas such as No Child Left Behind, IDEA, and the Community Services Block Grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed, however, that this year, due to funding constraints, the National Youth Sports Program was not funded in this appropriations bill. The National Youth Sports Program program is an educational partnership that has worked successfully for over 37 years. It provides low-income children ages 10 to 16 a 5-week summer program offering sports and academic programs at colleges and universities nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While touring the NYSP program on the UW-Eau Claire and UW-LaCrosse campuses in my district on several occasions, I have witnessed firsthand how this program reaches beyond academics and sports to provide opportunities for learning about good nutrition, developing leadership skills and developing good character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In previous years, the program served approximately 76,000 children at 201 colleges and universities across the country. The loss in Federal funding, however, has had a dramatic effect on the program's operation. It is expected there will only be 50 programs and 10,000 students participating this summer nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our home State of Wisconsin, close to 1,600 young people once participated in this program, yet this year, unfortunately, that figure has dramatically declined to approximately 400 children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and I commend him for his work on this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, our Nation is facing a major health care crisis because of childhood obesity. Due to a significant decline in physical activity by our Nation's youth, a growing number of children are experiencing illnesses and the other health problems, such as Type II diabetes, hypertension and respiratory problems. The rise in obesity-related health conditions also has high economic costs and has greatly increased health care spending, both mandatory and discretionary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As the social and economic costs of childhood obesity increase, the number of children engaging in physical activity is drastically decreasing and many schools are even cutting back on physical education programs because of budgetary concerns. It is critical that we focus our efforts on funding for physical activity at this time to fight this epidemic of childhood obesity and improve the health of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the National Youth Sports Program is a vital program that promotes physical activity and provides children with the leadership and academic skills to improve their well-being. Due to the elimination of funding for NYSP next fiscal year, many children in Tennessee and throughout the country will lose the opportunity to participate in this important program. I simply ask that you work with us to ensure that proper funds are allocated to NYSP and the promotion of physical activity  as we go to conference.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am familiar with the NYSP program given the fact of that the University of Wisconsin-Superior in my district hosted a program in 2005.

    <paragraph>As the chairman is aware, earlier this year we sent a bipartisan letter to the committee requesting an $18 million appropriation for NYSP, and given the importance of this program to many children throughout the country and the fact that NYSP has successfully leveraged Federal funding to secure substantial matching community investments, we would hope that if funding is found on the Senate side, that both the House and the chairman would be supportive of the funding level coming out  of the Senate in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also our hope that in the future NYSP will receive an outreach of support to continue its agenda for organizations that specialize in assisting at-risk youth. This program is too vital for the health and well-being of our young people for it to be left unfunded for another year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My intention today is to raise awareness of the Members of the House of Representatives surrounding the issue of administrative budget of the Social Security Administration and the impact it has on real people across America. Because previous Congresses have failed to meet the basic funding requirements of the Social Security Administration, the agency is in the process of closing field offices to try to rein in costs. One of those field offices is in my district, the 24th Congressional District  of New York in the city of Auburn. Auburn serves as a population base for rural Cayuga County; and of the approximately 81,000 residents in that county, nearly 20,000, or 25 percent, are on Social Security, that is, they receive benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Closing the field office in Auburn, New York, means that those 20,000 beneficiaries, most of whom are elderly, will need to drive to the next nearest offices in Syracuse or Geneva, New York. Public transportation in this area is inadequate, and this potential closing will mean that many residents will simply not have access to a Social Security Administration office for face-to-face interviews. Staff of the Social Security Administration has explained that the services can be provided by phone  or through the Social Security Administration online system, but for these financially vulnerable beneficiaries, these were not real options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't believe that the Social Security Administration should close or consolidate field offices until the agency reports back to Congress regarding the number of recipients who would be negatively impacted and allow the Congress to thoroughly review the economic analysis of potential field office realignment, consolidation, or closing proposals.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I share the gentleman's concern about the Social Security Administration budget. Since January, the committee has provided $550 million in additional resources. It has come in large part because of requests of people like yourself who have constantly reminded us of the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the bill we are debating today, the committee has included over $400 million above the 2007 level and $100 million more than the administration's request. Years of underfunding SSA and the other programs in this bill, such as No Child Left Behind, IDEA, and NIH, cannot be remedied in any one year, but we are certainly doing the best we can to accelerate.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>I understand you are making every effort to reverse the trend of underfunding the Social Security Administration to ensure that the agency can keep up with the increasing work loads due to the retirement of the first crop of the baby boomers and on the increasing backlog and disability claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will be able to work together as this bill moves forward to make certain that the SSA has adequate funding to keep the field offices open, especially in expansive rural districts like mine, the 27th in New York, and provide Social Security benefits that keep the elderly and those with disabilities out of poverty.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be happy to continue to work with the gentleman in conference in the future to obtain the highest level possible for SSA. I know it is a very important problem.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and his fine staff for all the help you have been on this issue in your efforts to keep the Social Security field offices open, for your willingness to work on increasing Social Security funding in conference. These efforts will make a real difference in the lives of thousands of Americans not only in my district but around the country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment is intended to make it possible for more teachers throughout America to have the professional development that we have promised them in science, math and technology education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may know that under No Child Left Behind, the Elementary and Secondary Act reauthorization, that was the Eisenhower Program that provided teacher training and professional development, was changed to Math and Science Partnership. Subsequently, the funding was cut to about a quarter of what had previously been provided, and it has never recovered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that the committee under Chairman Obey's leadership has tried to get back that lost ground that was lost under previous leadership. Nevertheless, the teachers and hence the students are not getting what they need. Whether you look at the "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report of the National Academy of Sciences or the Congress's own Innovation Agenda or the President's Competitive Initiative, we are all saying, in fact leaders of this country are yelling and screaming  that we must do better in science and math education for our competitiveness, for our quality of life. If we are to do that, we must help the teachers with their professional development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding prior to No Child Left Behind for math and science teacher development was $485 million. Currently under this appropriations bill in front of us, the funding for the successor programs for math and science teacher professional development is $182 million. Again, I recognize what the committee has been trying to do. It is not enough. We owe it to the students. We owe it to the teachers. But even more, we owe it to our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If our economy is to grow, if our productivity is going to grow, we must do better in math and science education. This is one of the important steps as recommended by the Glen Commission on Elementary and Secondary Education, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, as recommended by so many, including so many in this room. So I urge the adoption of my amendment which would put $25 million additional dollars into the Math and Science Partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Earlier today, the gentleman had a previous amendment which tried to put money in a worthy program, and I expressed then my concern about the offset. I must do the same thing on this occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point I'm making is while I certainly understand why the gentleman wants to add the funds that he wants to add, I simply cannot continue to buy into the idea that we can take all of these items out of administrative budgets. It simply is not responsible. Of course, I don't think it is responsible for the White House to claim that this bill is underfunded either. These programs are very good programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Members are going through this elaborate dog and pony show, or some would call it cock and bull story, because they are prevented from doing what they know should really happen, which is we should be expanding some of these programs without gouging others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply cannot support this amendment and I would not at all urge Members to vote for it not because the funding that the gentleman seeks isn't worthy, but because the solution that the gentleman lays out isn't real, unless you think that we can have agencies run programs with no desks and no lights and no phones and no personnel, nobody to cut the checks and no policy direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So, with that, I yield back the balance of my time and regretfully indicate my opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have rushed down to the floor to support this amendment, and a little history is helpful at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When No Child Left Behind was written, it removed Eisenhower funding from the program. We had been putting in over $400 million per year for Eisenhower funding, most of which went to math and science education. I had written a formula into the bill as it left the House which put Math-Science Education in great shape and maintained roughly the same funding that the Eisenhower program had. However, the Senate removed that provision, and ever since then we have been funding math and science education  at considerably lower figures than we did before No Child Left Behind was written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this particular bill, the Department of Education has received a substantial boost, No Child Left Behind has received a substantial boost, but the funding for math and science education has remained level, and that just doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know from the statistics and the measurements, and the international tests that have been made, that our students are not able to compete with students from other countries at the 12th grade high school level. We are far behind, and we have made a valiant effort in this body to improve that situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have started the STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, Education Caucus. Well over 100 Members of Congress have joined us because they support the need for improving math and science education. If we are serious about competing with other countries in innovation and development, and getting our manufacturing up to snuff, we have to improve our K-12 education, and that is what this amendment is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very strongly support the amendment, and I urge the body to adopt this amendment. With that, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Briefly, Madam Chairman, this is a real dilemma. We just cut the administrative budget by $125 million for historically black colleges. This is another $25 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need is clearly there. I think the subcommittee's done a good job providing funds, but it is a dilemma and I think Members are going to have a tough decision to make on this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, this is an issue with which we're all very familiar. We've just heard some interesting debate on the floor here. My colleague, Mr. Cooper, offered I think an excellent amendment to increase the funding for Historically Black Colleges and made a very strong case for that. He noted that he was not able to designate a source for that and that it would require $125 million in funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just discussed the importance of science education and the need for funding for that amendment, and the Chairman of the full committee has made the point that there simply aren't enough funds to accomplish these purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest that this amendment is something that we could look to find those funds. It strikes funds for the AmeriCorps program, saving some $255.6 million. That is double the amount of money needed to fund or to plus up the funding for Historically Black Colleges requested by Mr. Cooper and, therefore, would leave room for the science funding that was just advanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest that, while well-intentioned, the AmeriCorps program simply does not achieve its goal. It has been plagued throughout its history with paying volunteers for programs that are inappropriate, and I will recite some of those, but more importantly, it denigrates the notion of volunteerism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation has been known since its inception for its grand tradition of volunteerism, going back to Alexis de Toqueville, who wrote about America and the volunteers of this Nation. It simply is important for Americans to volunteer, and the notion of this program to pay young people to volunteer simply makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk about some of the abuses. AmeriCorps volunteers have been paid to lobby against the voter-approved California initiative to put violent criminals in prison for life after their third violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps volunteers, if you can call them that since they're paid, have been paid to disrupt Republican political events while working for the liberal advocacy group Acorn. Don't just trust me; it's a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps volunteers have been paid to press for rent control in cities across our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps workers, not really volunteers, have also been paid to seek expanded Federal housing subsidies and to enroll more people in welfare programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Citizens Against Government Waste, the watchdog group here in Washington, has vigilantly tracked many examples where AmeriCorps funds have been abused, and Citizens Against Government Waste issued a report saying that AmeriCorps has become a showcase for the waste and abuse inherent in many federalized civic sub-enterprises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both private and public investigators have determined that AmeriCorps' financial books are unauditable. AmeriCorps' own Inspector General years ago documented cases in which recruits received funds for working at a McDonald's while being paid for not working at all and for working while they were in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is a very simple amendment that I will only take 2 minutes to discuss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It eliminates all funds for AmeriCorps. It denies opportunities to 73,000 individuals to earn college assistance awards through serving their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It may not suit the gentleman's fancy that these folks volunteer and are paid, but I would suggest that it's a whole lot better than having people who don't volunteer at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the gentleman cites what he considers to be abuses of the program. You know, when I looked at the Congress, I've seen abuse by Mr. Cunningham, I've seen abuse by Mr. Ney. In the old days, I saw abuse by Mr. Hayes, and a few other Members, but you know what, I didn't see anybody move to shut down the entire Congress because of the abuses of a few idiots. And I would suggest that we ought to apply the same standards to AmeriCorps that we apply to the Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I'd like to speak on this amendment. I couldn't get to the floor fast enough. I have immense respect for my colleague from Arizona, but I think that he has confused the issues in a way that's very powerful until you look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a service program, and we're asking young people to serve their country. They're given a minimum wage. The last I knew people need food and money in order to stay somewhere. To ask an 18- or 19-year-old young person to serve without having the ability to buy food and to live somewhere strikes me as pretty remarkable. I view this as service just as I view serving in the military as service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something they do because they want to be part of a higher cause and we designed this program so it wasn't a one-size-fits-all. It's not this big government program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we designed this program to do is to allow each of the States to create programs through nonprofit organizations and others, and we allow the  States to choose which programs they want to fund. And that means you're going to have a lot of good programs and you are going to have some bad programs. You're going to have programs that really do a terrific job and some programs that don't do a good job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the former administration for its willingness to design a Republican kind of program, a program that has a competitive model. You compete for these dollars on the State level, a program that allows you to have excellence at the risk of having something that may not work well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what my colleague described about the failures of this institution doesn't mean we get rid of Congress because of some of the jerks that have served here and some of the outrageous things they have done. You find out where there are mistakes and you change them. So when there is a program that isn't auditable, we made sure that we audit these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a Peace Corps volunteer, but I confess that when I served overseas, they provided me housing and I confess that when I served overseas they provided me money to buy food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was called a Peace Corps volunteer, and the reason why I felt that I was a volunteer was I was giving 2 years of my life in service to others. I deferred my career to some extent while my wife and I served in the Peace Corps and I think Mr. Walsh could say the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americorps is a program that takes 18, 19, 20-year-old kids who may never have had work before, gives them an opportunity to have work under a mentored program by various nonprofit organizations. You should see these kids, the thrill and the excitement that they have in being part of this program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the three speakers here. I think we are all ex-Peace Corps volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the other aspect of AmeriCorps is very much like Peace Corps in that we have invested in folks like ourselves, and the return on the investment has paid many, many times over a service to our country, a service to our community, and I think that the kind of investment that we are looking at in AmeriCorps is the same. And the kinds of monies that have been spent for us as Peace Corps volunteers was what we call subsistence allowance to allow us to be able to do the kind of work we do.  Coming home, we have been able to share our experiences and fulfill the third mandate, and that was to return back home and give back to our communities. I suspect that this is the same thing that the young people in the AmeriCorps are experiencing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a great investment of tax dollars.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's interesting to note that there are three returned Peace Corps volunteers here today, one Democrat, two Republicans. In the Congress, there are three of each, three Republicans, three Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, more importantly, our appetite for public service was not whetted just by Peace Corps. It certainly broadened our lives. I joke with people. I never crossed Main Street in Syracuse from the east side to the west side until I was 16 years old. I went to college, went into the Peace Corps. The world got a lot bigger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have come back, and I have met people in every walk of life who were Peace Corps volunteers. I suspect the same will happen with AmeriCorps volunteers. In fact, 90 percent, almost 90 percent of former AmeriCorps volunteers come back and volunteer on their own. They continue to provide, to work in public service. They continue to support organizations in their own community. This is a citizen-building organization. So few of our young people today focus on what they can do for their country.  This is a great way to get them to focus on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's $250 million, a lot of money, but it's an investment. You hear that a lot, but you can see the investment. Whether you agree with our politics or not, you can see the investment paid off, in that individuals like ourselves from very different backgrounds wound up here at the highest level of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that this program will continue to produce young Americans who are idealistic, but realistic enough to know that they have to work hard to serve their community and give back something to their society. So I have great respect for my colleague and my friend from Arizona. I just strongly disagree. Volunteerism is alive and well because of programs like this. We need to maintain it and retain it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honor each of the gentlemen here who were Peace Corps volunteers. I recognize that they, indeed, may have been inspired to become pure volunteers, unpaid volunteers, as a result of their service in the Peace Corps. But I think what is sad about this debate is we haven't really discussed the issue I raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Connecticut says he is for a program where they are paid a stipend to live and how they couldn't volunteer unless they were paid some living expense or unless they were paid for some food expense. Unfortunately, that's not the structure of the AmeriCorps program. The AmeriCorps program we are debating today, and the one that I am challenging the funding for and suggesting how funding could be better used, provides wages to the AmeriCorps so-called volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want to create a separate program, I am in favor of that. If we want to encourage volunteers by paying them a stipend instead of wages, by providing them housing instead of wages, then we might not distort the meaning of volunteerism, but we don't do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's not what this program does. This program pays them wages, and as in the example I cited, it pays them wages in some cases to do work for which they are being paid, to work at a McDonald's. It seems to me that if you want to inspire volunteerism, which I encourage and encouraged in my opening remarks, then let's inspire volunteerism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want to provide a stipend for housing, let's provide a stipend for housing. If you want to provide a stipend for meals, let's provide a stipend for meals. But don't call wages a stipend for housing or meals. These are wages to which these people are paid. I suggest people that do volunteer in this country, and there are millions, to set up a government program to say the only people that volunteer are people who are encouraged to volunteer by being paid to do so diminishes all of us and  all of the volunteers in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wholeheartedly agree that if we want to revise AmeriCorps and make it a program which encourages volunteers  and pays them to volunteer and pays them a stipend for a living, including housing and/or food, absolutely. But to pay them wages is wrong. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="SALARIES AND EXPENSES">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment that recognizes the difficult fiscal situation facing our government. The Labor-HHS appropriations bill comes in at $7 billion over last year's level and $10.8 billion over the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have and others have said during this process, taxpayers are being asked to pay more in taxes because Congress is not willing to make hard choices and balance our spending with our income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, my Democratic colleagues feel it is necessary to burden the American taxpayer with the largest tax increase in history in order to fund these out-of-control and runaway spending bills. This amendment, in particular, would make the tough choice of maintaining fiscal prudence by eliminating funding in the bill for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, saving $420 million for the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, in his budget request, asked for zero. The most recent appropriation a year ago was for $400 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets 85 percent of its budget from sources other than this Federal budget, so only 15 percent of its budget is reliant on what is appropriated here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the appropriation is made 2 years in advance. That's a curious situation. I don't know if it applies to very many other sectors in our budget, but with a 2-year advance notice, the corporation would have plenty of time to make the adjustments necessary to adjust to the zeroing out of this budget amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, where could this money be made up from if the corporation needs that extra funding? There are many sources that it has available. It is very successful in its type of programming, for the most part. I believe that through further corporate sponsorship and commercial sponsorship, through using the popular programming like Sesame Street to generate some income like we do in the free market of our economy, that 15 percent could easily be made up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, let me make the constitutional argument, I see in the Constitution that there are enumerated powers that our Federal Government is supposed to be doing. The Federal Government is supposed to provide for the common defense. The Federal Government is supposed to regulate interstate commerce, coin money, do the U.S. mail, and there are things like that, but I don't see providing entertainment as part of our constitutional powers and responsibilities that the Federal Government is supposed  to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hollywood is plenty good at doing that and other sectors of the private part of our economy. I just don't think that that's the Federal role for government, especially when the American taxpayer is being asked in this budget process that we're going through right now to come up with deficit spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already, the appropriations bills that have come before this House are $20 billion over what the President has asked, and we are looking at a large deficit in the next year as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that this amendment be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="SALARIES AND EXPENSES">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, what this amendment does is eliminate all of the funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I think that would be a very ill-advised thing to do. This Congress has spoken on funding for that organization many times. It has had strong support, often bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman complains about the fact that it is advance funded. It is advance funded for two reasons: number one, so that you can assure some kind of political independence from political pressure, and, secondly, because programmers need advance time in order to plan their programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The advance funding concept was begun 31 years ago by that notorious big spender Jerry Ford when he was President, my good friend, my good buddy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this amendment passes, 1,150 public radio and TV stations will be hurt. That will fall especially hard on rural stations. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't think we ought to do anything that would lead us 1 inch more toward a world in which the only kind of news we got was from the commercial stations feeding us the lately breathless news about Britney Spears, Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell. I would like to see a little bit better than that, and I think we get it from public broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as the gentleman talking about taxes, we have seen Republican after Republican march down here like good little young Republicans in their college days repeating their mantra about taxes when this bill has nothing to do with taxes. They are all dutifully parroting their words like the Chinese used to do from Mao's Little Red Book. It's no more impressive now than it was then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just simply say that for someone to support spending $600 billion on the war in Iraq and spend $57 billion in tax cuts for millionaires and then somehow to suggest that the 2 percent difference in this bill between the President and us somehow has something to do with fiscal irresponsibility is a joke. The American people know it, and so do the Members of this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="SALARIES AND EXPENSES">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's eloquence and his courtesy in allowing me to speak on this. And he is absolutely right; there has been a longstanding process of advanced funding to give our public broadcasting stations the ability to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He talks about it only being 15 percent of the budget. That 15 percent of the budget is critical, particularly for small and rural areas. There will always be public broadcasting in Denver or San Francisco or New York, but this money, these grants speak to the very heart of the ability to deal with sparsely populated areas from coast to coast. These are the people that would be punished if this ill-advised amendment were passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, last but not least, he advances the notion that somehow this is just providing entertainment. I would strongly suggest that the gentleman offering this amendment go visit his public broadcasting system, because you will find that it is not just entertainment. Public broadcasting is culture, it is education, it is public safety. Indeed, this is the backbone in many parts of the country of emergency communications network. The notion that somehow this is only Big Bird and entertainment, and  all we have got to do is commercialize public broadcasting more, misses the essence of why we have broad bipartisan support for public broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge rejection of this ill-advised amendment on behalf of 110 bipartisan members of the Public Broadcasting Caucus, over 100 of whom signed the letter to the appropriators supporting this budget. It is the 15 percent that is most critical for rural America. It is the advanced funding that provides the stability for things like the Ken Burns commentary. And it is not about just providing entertainment, it is education, it is culture, it is public safety. Public broadcasting is providing  a voice for America, a noncommercial independent voice that is too often sadly lacking. It isn't available anyplace else in the gazillion channels on our cable networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to address one thing very quickly that the chairman used. I could probably ask that his words be taken down. But to accuse us of parroting as Mao's little underlings did is offensive, and it reminds me of one of my mother's favorite expressions: I believe we have got the pot calling the kettle black.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="SALARIES AND EXPENSES">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I also wanted to say that I serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and we struggle over there with budget needs for our veterans, both those who are in conflict now and will soon become veterans, those going back as far as World War II, and this $420 million would go a long way toward helping our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not saying that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting should suffer. They can turn around and find corporate sponsorship, commercial opportunities. They could easily make up for that in the free market; and they are successful, and they would easily do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just say that this funding should not be the responsibility of the American taxpayer.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we have been down this road before. I believe public television has an important role to play both culturally and, more importantly, educationally. And as my colleague from Oregon mentioned, this is an essential and growing aspect of our public safety system and our ability to communicate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Rochester, New York, WXXI is using its digital signal to provide a network for local public service organizations, public safety organizations, first responders, not only for communication but for training, and also to help in coordinating large-scale emergency activities so that everyone is communicating within the same network and on the same bandwidth. So it is a very flexible system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had my issues with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I had a very serious disagreement with them over the publication of what I thought was a very important movie regarding the lack of response by moderate Muslims to the radical Islamic fundamentalist zealots who are around the world today. The story I thought was a very well-told story, and it wasn't resolved certainly in my favor and in my view. But that aside, this would be a mistake to support this amendment, and for other reasons  I oppose the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is I guess what I would call a put up or shut up amendment for the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult for the press to cover budget stories because they are complicated. It is difficult for the press to cover stories about policy because they are complicated. But it is a whole lot easier for the press and for individual Members of this House to complain about some other Member, or in the case of the press any Member, trying to do something in his district, or in the case of a House Member complaining about somebody trying to do something in a different district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a constitutional right to direct spending. In fact, that is the primary power of the Congress, to direct the executive branch in the spending of the taxpayers' money. The executive branch in fact directs far more spending than does the Congress, and yet I  recognize a Member's individual right to object to any direct spending that is engaged in by the Congress or the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to put that discussion in perspective. The last year that I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee this bill had no earmarks when it left the House. During the 12 years that the Republicans controlled this House, earmarks exploded to over 3,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we have cut earmarks back to 1,300. We have cut the dollar amount in this bill for earmarks back to a very small amount, less than half of the amount that was in the bill 2 years ago. In fact, as the percentage of the total bill, earmarks make up two-tenths of 1 percent. Two-tenths of 1 percent. And yet, the debate on that two-tenths of 1 percent has dominated in the press and dominated the congressional debate. That is ridiculous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I am tired of having the committee serve as a punching bag for members of the press or Members of this body. I will be happy to play this issue flat, or I will be happy to play it round.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I'll be happy to bring a bill to the House floor with these earmarks, or without them. Those who know me well in this House know that I deeply resent the time that we have to take dealing with earmarks, and they know that the reason that I urged that we cut earmarks to 50 percent of the previous level 2 years ago is not because I thought they were impure, but because I thought they were beginning to be so numerous that they were unmanageable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I'm going to give the House a choice. We've got lots of amendments pending before us on individual earmarks. I'm going to give the House a choice. I want the House to choose whether it wants to proceed with earmarks or not. If it does, then it will reject the amendment that I sent to the desk. If it doesn't want to proceed with these earmarks, then you can save a whole lot of time by knocking them all out with one vote. I invite you to put up or shut up, and make up your mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be a neutral player in this. I will offer the amendment, and I will vote present so that I'm not pushing people to vote either for or against eliminating these earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want, before we move to individual earmark debate, I want to know whether the House itself takes responsibility for the decision to move ahead with earmarks, or whether it doesn't. And if they want to decide no, be my guest. It will make my life a whole lot easier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will do one thing that will bother me at night.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>It will give total authority to the executive branch, and that is not a healthy thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, and I do so knowing full well that this earmark issue is a very, very controversial issue these days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What prompts me to oppose the amendment is that I believe, having served here for now my 19th year, that the Constitution was very clear. The power of the purse resides in the Congress, in the House of Representatives. The Appropriations Committee is responsible for allocating those funds. Members of Congress know their districts and the needs of those districts better than anyone else does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, historically the administration has, through its budget director and its department heads, directed spending through the budget resolution in conjunction with Members of Congress and the budget committee. And I respect that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they need to respect our priorities also. And I think all Members should respect the priorities of those individual Members who know their districts best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, as the chairman mentioned, this is a very small percentage of the overall Federal budget, remembering that the discretionary portion of the budget is only one-third of the entire Federal budget. And earmarks are a small percentage, less than 1 percent, I believe, of that discretionary portion of that one-third of the Federal budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But these dollars make a difference in communities. They help with economic development; they provide housing where the Federal programs just don't fit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came here as a city councilman. I saw all kinds of Federal programs that did not work for my community. And I said to myself, if I ever get to Washington and I have the ability to affect Federal policy, to make it more flexible, to make it work for my community, I will do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my dad served as mayor of Syracuse and then came here and served for three terms. He was here when revenue sharing began. Revenue sharing was all about helping local communities direct spending so that it better suited their needs. That was under the Nixon administration. It was a breakthrough. It was Federalism taken to its lowest common denominator so that the cities and the counties had the ability to make a difference and get some of those taxpayer dollars back and put them to work in  their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that the chairman is making a point here. I hope Members will oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me just say this: for the 40 years that the Democratic Party controlled the Congress, they may not have had earmarks in these bills, but they were not pure as the driven snow, Madam Chairman. The way they did it in the old days was the old bulls, who were primarily from the southern part of the country, who served as Chairs of the full committees and subcommittees on appropriations, and were here for 25, 30, 40 years, they would just put the money in the bill. They knew where the money  was. The chairman of that Department knew where the money was; and after the bill was signed, the chairman called up that Department Secretary and said, here's where you're going to spend the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what we did, I suppose, is we made a mistake by democratizing this process. We opened it up. We Republicans opened it up so that all Members would have the same opportunity, maybe not as much money, but the same opportunity to help their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, yes, there has been abuse. But the Members who've abused this, by and large, go to jail, and that's as it should be. If they break the rules, if they benefit themselves, if they stoke their own greed with taxpayers' dollars, they belong in jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's not bring this whole appropriations process into question, because there is a rotten apple in every barrel, and we've got to find them out, and we do. And the system works in that respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's oppose this amendment. We'll take votes on the individual earmarks. There's going to be lots of amendments to talk about. Those Members will come and they will defend them and, hopefully, make good arguments for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's defeat this amendment and get back to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'll claim time in opposition, but I have a feeling that I'm being talked into this rather quickly. By the end of this, I'll be very much in support. In fact, this is one of the best amendments already I think I've ever heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee mentioned that when he left the committee over a decade ago there were no earmarks in this bill. That's commendable. That's wonderful. We should go back to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Member just a few minutes ago talked about how critical this program was that somebody sought to cut funding for. Critical. Has to be there. I think we need a reminder that there were no House earmarks in this bill last year. No Labor-HHS earmarks. The world didn't come crashing to a halt. The year before that there were no earmarks in Labor-HHS because of political problems with it. The planets, as far as I know, stayed in orbit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need these earmarks. I mean, when you look at the list that they'll soon be offering here for an  exploratorium in San Francisco, corporation for Jefferson's poplar forest, for expansion of exhibits and research, money for the Burpee Museum in Rockford, Illinois, or the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, or for the American Jazz Museum or American Ballet Theater, are these things that the Federal Government has to be funding, or are they things that  could be funded at the local level or by private entities?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are we simply supplanting the free market or private funding with more Federal funding here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman, distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, makes a great point that it is our prerogative. We have the power of the purse. And we do. The problem with earmarking, in its contemporary form, is that we are circumventing the process here. We are telling the Federal agencies, we don't like what you're doing and so we'll one-up you. We'll make appropriations equally suspect to what you're doing, instead of saying, you know, that was a bad way to spend money, we're going  to cut your funding. We're going to call you into hearings and ask you to explain why you're spending money irresponsibly. That is perfectly proper. We should be doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, instead, what we're doing is saying, you think you can spend money willy-nilly; we'll show you. We're going to put 15,000 earmarks in this year, as we did a couple of years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I make no excuses for the Republican Party here. Earmarks have grown and became out of control on our watch. As the gentleman pointed out, there were some 1,400 earmarks in all appropriation bills in 1994. In 2005 or 2006, I believe there were over 15,000. That's inexcusable. That's part of the reason we Republicans are here squarely in the minority today. That doesn't excuse us for saying, all right, we're still going to put 1,300 earmarks in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee wisely said weeks ago, we simply cannot police this process. We don't have enough staff on the Appropriations Committee. And he offered an alternative suggestion that we wait and find out what the earmarks were. None of us liked that alternative suggestion, but the premise was correct. We can't police these things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just yesterday I came with an amendment to the Energy and Water bill, and we found out that the center for which the earmark was intended doesn't even exist. We've gone from the bridge to nowhere to the center that's nowhere. And still we funded it. We got only 98 votes opposed because of log-rolling that takes place here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I certainly sympathize with what's going on here, and I appreciate the gentleman for what he's doing. We have a time-honored practice here in Congress of authorization, appropriation and oversight. Earmarking, in its contemporary form, circumvents that process, where we kick out authorization, we kick out oversight and we just appropriate. We do far too little of the authorizing and oversight, and we just appropriate. Whenever you do 1,300 earmarks in a bill, that's what you're doing. And  I would submit that these haven't been scrubbed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another earmark that I was to propose yesterday, the authors of the earmark came just before and withdrew, actually offered their own amendment to strip the earmark I was going to seek to limit funds for because it hadn't been adequately scrubbed, and they probably knew that it couldn't withstand the scrutiny that came on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here we are, there's no way we can offer amendments for 1,300 earmarks. We'd test the patience of the Members and this whole body. We can't do that. But neither can we, or should we go forward and simply approve these as if every Member who has an earmark has a right to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I indicated, when I offered this amendment, that I would vote "present." And the reason I want to do that is because I want every Member of this House to vote for or against this bill on final passage on the basis of what they think of it on the merits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want, both by my "present" vote and by my comments here, to make it perfectly clear to Members on both sides of the aisle that no matter how they vote on the issue of earmarks and no matter how they vote on the issue of substance, I don't intend to let one affect the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't care whether Members vote to include earmarks or exclude them. And I will not do what was done to us 3 years ago when, after we voted against the Labor-H bill because we thought it provided inadequate funding for many national responsibilities, that virtually every single one of the earmarks for Democrats were stripped from the bill because of that vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm in charge of this subcommittee, there will be no log-rolling with respect to this issue. As far as I'm concerned, this is an individual vote of conscience and of practical judgment on the part of each Member of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the record of Congress, Congress has earmarked funds since the beginning of the Republic. At least four of the appropriation bills are, by their nature, project oriented, so they must contain congressional earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to point out, if we're going to start making comparisons, the HHS Department, just 2 years ago, had $1.9 billion in funds that they shoveled out without being shoveled out on a competitive basis. That is the same, that is the executive branch functional equivalent earmarking. It is directed spending, whether it occurs in the Congress or in the executive branch. And the action of that Department alone represented direct spending in the amount seven times as large as the amount contained  in this bill tonight on behalf of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want Members to vote however you want. But as I said, as far as I'm concerned, this is a put-up-or-shut-up amendment. If you want earmarks, vote for them. If you don't, vote against them. Either way I'll be a happy man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey).</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we already had a debate and discussion about whether there should be earmarks and whether there should not be earmarks. And let me just say that as much as I think there are many inappropriate earmarks, I don't think there have to be no earmarks, but I do think that the process under which we do these earmarks now is still flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, admittedly, it is frankly, more open than it was last year. But it is still not as transparent and still not as accountable as it should be. And I offered a few suggestions which I will run through quickly, and then I would like to yield to the gentleman from Arizona, as to things that I think we could do in this House in order to make earmarks completely transparent and completely accountable so that this House is not embarrassed by them because, frankly, we have been embarrassed by them  in the past, and there are ones I believe that are embarrassing this House that are presently involved in this bill and some other bills and will be in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my suggestions are simple. First, disclose all the earmark requests. Why should we not do that? When we enter a bill, it is disclosed. It is public knowledge that this is something we are trying to make a change on. If any Member wants to spend the taxpayers' money on something and they want to do an official form where they sign that says they have no financial interest, then why shouldn't that be made public?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's put every earmark in the text of the bill. As I believe the gentleman from Wisconsin knows, it is very difficult to write amendments to take all the earmarks out of the bill because they are not actually written in the bill. So let's write them in the bill so that we do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the bill should fully disclose all earmarks with the requesting Member, the amounts, recipients, and the purpose at least a week before we bring them to the floor. We got the certifications less than 24 hours, I think it was only about 12 hours, before we started debate on the last bill. And that is just not enough time to review or make clear what these amendments are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All earmarks should be available for discussion and open congressional hearing. If there are earmarks in a bill, there should be a congressional hearing on those earmarks. Now, that doesn't mean that if there are 200 that you are going to discuss every one, but certainly every one would be available for discussion at that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All earmark programs should be previously authorized by Congress. If not, why do we even have an authorization process? If we are not going to follow it, if you are just going to be able to earmark anything you want, then why do we have an authorization process? And that is what I think is a lot of what has gone wrong with this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They should serve a Federal interest or have some Federal nexus. The Federal Government does not, should not, cannot, will not fund every single need and every single desire of every Member and every person in this country. There are lots of things which are properly left to State and local governments and charitable organizations. So we should make it clear that we only spend Federal money on those things with a Federal nexus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No earmarks outside of a Member's own State. If the point of this is just to do things for your constituency, make sure you are doing things for your constituency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No earmarks for private entities without some kind of a competitive bid process. I will tell you a story of a defense contractor in my district who came to me and showed me this fine device, and I said, That's great, but how do I know it works? And if I knew it works, how do I know you are the best source for that? And if I knew you were the best source for that, how would I know that this is the right price for that? The answer is I don't think Members can know those things. So if it is a private  entity, let's competitively bid it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nine, no earmark can be added or increased in conference committee. That is a way to go around all of this. Let's make it that you take the Senate version or the House version but you don't make up a new one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, that the dollar amount of any earmark that is reduced by an amendment, that money should be saved to the taxpayer. It should go to debt reduction. It should go to deficit reduction. Congressman Culberson had a proposal in the Appropriations Committee, which was defeated, to do exactly that. And why shouldn't we do that? If there is money in a bill and we are not going to spend it on that, let's save it for the taxpayers. That is one of the ways we can reduce this deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So those are some thoughts that I have as to how this process can be improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much time do I have remaining, Madam Chairman?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has 5 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I won't take 4 minutes, but I just want to commend the gentleman for bringing this forward and having such a thoughtful approach to earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should mention what we will hear today, I am sure many, many times, is that Members will come to the floor and say, It is my district, I know it best; and other Members will say, Let's defer to that Member because that Member knows his district better than anybody else, and, therefore, we should defer all spending decisions to that Member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me remind us all, though, that just a couple of weeks ago more than 100 Members from this side of the aisle and 149 Members from that side of the aisle voted to strike an earmark from a Member's district. So I hope that we don't hear that because that is not always the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We make policy for the entire country, and we spend the taxpayers' money, and it is not always the case that any Member should have his or her way in their district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that this is a thoughtful process and I would support this. It looks like that there are conflicting amendments that are similar, and I hope that one of them passes to strike all earmarks from the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, how much time do I have remaining now?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has 4 minutes remaining.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly thank him for his leadership in this institution on this very, very important subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be supporting, I suppose, the chairman's amendment. He said he was not interested, I believe, in biasing the decision; so he will vote present, although I think that the distinguished chairman had voted against the gentleman from California's amendment yesterday on another bill. So I am not sure if the outcome hasn't already been prejudiced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be that as it may, I have not been opposed to all earmarks. I understand the opportunity and constitutional responsibility that this body has. But as I have observed the process, the process, I believe, more often than not, has led to bad results. And particularly the bad result that I see and why I commend the gentleman from California for his leadership in this area is that I believe, more often than not, we help teach people to become more dependent upon the Federal Government. People who  never thought about receiving a Federal earmark now come to their local Member of Congress. There was a time when many individuals would compete in the marketplace of ideas and compete in the marketplace for business and compete in the marketplace for charitable contributions, and now they are being taught they need to compete in the halls of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall dealing with a large major medical research institute in my hometown of Dallas, Texas, that does world renowned science who was always happy to come and compete in a competitive bid process for research dollars at the National Institutes of Health, but they woke up one day and many other institutions instead were receiving earmarks; so now they went out and invested their money in a Washington lobbyist and they started receiving earmarks. I do not necessarily view this as a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I wish I had coined the phrase, but our colleague in the other body, the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, once said that earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction. That may not be true in all cases, but it is certainly true in many cases. And more often than not, I fear that they represent a victory of special interests over the general interest. They represent a victory, often, of secrecy over transparency. Even now we are having trouble trying to put the dollar amounts  with the Member, with the earmark. Certainly, I don't see the transparency that I thought that we would have seen from the committee on this matter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The time of the gentleman from Texas has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I intend to support the gentleman from Wisconsin's amendment. But I do believe, and I hope the gentleman from Wisconsin can hear me, that there is an alternative. There is something between the current very flawed process and no earmarks. I hope that we can engage in a discussion about this. I realize it is too late for it in this appropriations cycle but to discuss in the next appropriations cycle.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Amendment No. 19 offered by Mr. Flake:</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. __X. (a) Limitation on Use of Funds.--None of the funds in this Act shall be available for the Exploratorium, San Francisco, California, for its Bay Area Science Teacher Recruitment, Retention, and Improvement Initiative.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) Corresponding Reduction of Funds.--The amount otherwise provided by this Act for "Department of Education--Innovation and Improvement" is hereby reduced by $300,000.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would prevent $300,000 from funding the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco, California, and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, when I came across this earmark, I decided that I would explore why a successful museum like this would request money from the Federal Government. According to the earmark description in the certification letter submitted to committee, the earmark would fund an initiative to promote professional development for science education teachers. But when my staff and I did research on this earmark, we found that a teacher development program already exists at the museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the museum's Web site, the Teacher Institute trains teachers during the summer sessions, while they participate in a mix of learning experiences designed to help teachers with hands-on activities, inquiry, and strong science content.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The institute was founded by numerous corporate sponsors and foundations, including the Noyce Foundation and the Bank of America. All of the teachers who attend the Teacher Institute do so with private support. Again, why is the Federal Government funding an initiative that corporations can and do already fund?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Exploratorium is a science museum that consists of 400 exhibits of art, science and the human perspective. It had over 600,000 visitors just last year. Cost of admission is $14 for adults, $9 for children. Income from government sources, both local and Federal, is almost $12 million. Nearly $9 million was contributed from individuals, corporations and foundations. It hardly seems that this museum is in some kind of financial straits, especially to the point that taxpayers around the country  should be asked to help fund a program that would benefit only teachers from one small area of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't disagree with the sponsor's desire for qualified science teachers in the classroom. Qualified teachers are necessary. But I do take issue with the increase in spending. This bill represents an increase of over $10 billion above the President's request and more than $2 billion over the Senate bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spending has got to stop somewhere. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Again, we are simply stopping $300,000 for a museum that has a budget of some $12 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me simply say, Madam Chairman, that there is nothing in the world more deadly than a dull science teacher. I know from long, personal experience, and so does one of my sons. Let me say that this earmark is meant to correct that problem in at least one area of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funds that are attacked by this amendment are for the Bay Area Science Teacher Recruitment, Retention and Improvement Initiative, which supports the professional development of the K-12 science teacher workforce of the Bay Area, with a particular focus on the needs of underserved schools. These funds would be used for professional development programs consisting of summer workshops and academic year follow-up activities for 500 science education teachers, online professional development activities,  and curriculum development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This initiative is being conducted by the Exploratorium, a private, nonprofit science museum in San Francisco. It is a longstanding program of professional development for science teachers. It has been awarded more National Science Foundation grants than any other museum. Those funds will significantly increase the number of teachers served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recruitment and retention of science teachers is a major problem in the Bay Area, with over 50 percent of new science teachers leaving the workforce within 5 years, causing ongoing shortages, particularly in high-poverty urban school districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that in the Bay Area urban school districts, more than 40 percent of high school teachers, 60 percent of middle school teachers, and 90 percent of newly hired science teachers are teaching at least one science course for which they are not technically qualified. High school science students in schools serving large minority populations are twice as likely to be taught by an unqualified teacher, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is consistent with the bipartisan White House and Congressional Priorities for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, the STEM program, and the U.S. Competitiveness Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would have hoped that the sponsor of the amendment, which I believe is the Speaker of the House, would have come here to defend it or talk more about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was a nice description, but again, the point isn't whether this is a worthy program or not or whether or not we need science teachers. I've had some rather dull ones as well, and I would rather have ones that are taught well and can teach well. But this museum has $12 million in revenue. This is 300,000 additional dollars given by the Federal Government. Why are we doing this? It's not because it's needed. It's because somebody can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would submit that when we are running a deficit like we are in this country and we have the debt like we do, why in the world are we doing this? What possible nexus is there for the Federal Government to come in and supplant private dollars with taxpayer dollars?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, it's interesting that folks would be making judgment about what I consider an educational facility. I am a science teacher and a good one. I was a student. I grew up in south Chicago where there were other facilities like the Museum of Science &amp; Industry and the Museum of Natural History, without which, as a youngster, I might have gotten more in trouble if I weren't interested in those facilities. It provided me a place to learn in a very casual way, but it was imprinted  in me for my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Exploratorium, I went there as a student when I was in grade school, and I remember all the experiences I had there. And as a science teacher, I took my classes there. $300,000 is a very small investment for a facility like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And by the way, I thought that we were always supportive of public/private ventures, and this is one of them. This Exploratorium is not a private facility either. It's open to the public for anyone who wishes to visit it and learn from it. Why, even people from Arizona can come and enjoy the kind of instruction that's in there. For me, it was life-long learning as a science teacher. It was a great facility to engage my students and expand their thinking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I think that this is a wonderful investment. And in the words of people from Silicon Valley, "return on investment is what you get."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <narrative> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. __X. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to pay the basic pay of any individual serving as Deputy Commissioner of Social Security, Social Security Administration, whose appointment to such position has not been confirmed by a vote of the Senate pursuant to section 702(b)(1) of the Social Security Act.</narrative>

  <narrative>(Mr. DINGELL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the amendment is simple. It's about protecting Social Security. It is about the fox guarding the hen roost. The fox is the new appointee who has been made Deputy Commissioner of Social Security, but who is unconfirmed by the United States Senate. The hen roost is Social Security and the care and concern of millions of Americans, retirees, orphans, widows, persons who are disabled. What we want to do is to see to it that those people who are in charge of Social Security  and guard Social Security are friends to the system and not enemies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social Security is one of the most extraordinary devices in the history of this country. It is one of the cheapest and the best ways of collecting money, and one of the fairest and the best ways of disbursing it and seeing to it that our senior citizens are protected by their government and that their pensions and that their retirement is made dignified and worthwhile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President appointed a fellow by the name of Biggs by a recess appointment, and he was made Deputy Commissioner of Social Security. His name is Andrew Biggs. He has had his appointment opposed by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the chairman said this, "because his support for the failed idea of privatization would reopen a settled debate about the future of Social Security reform."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment simply says no money may be spent on his salary until he has been confirmed; a simple, sensible, decent and proper protection for our retirees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Biggs has written dozens of articles in favor of privatization. He has compared Social Security to Enron and claimed that it was on the verge of imminent bankruptcy. He has argued that private accounts are the only solution to fund Social Security over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has worked to promote the agenda of privatization of Social Security time after time. Listen to some of the words  which he has said: "Social Security reform featuring personal retirement accounts doesn't send just one liberal sacred cow to the slaughterhouse; it sends the whole herd." This was a 1999 paper made by Mr. Andrew Biggs in which his thesis is that the dismantling of Social Security would lead to the dismantlement of all New Deal era programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing by adopting this amendment is putting Mr. Biggs before the Senate Finance Committee for hearings to inquire, is he in favor of Social Security? Does he want to privatize it? Does he want to abolish it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will protect Social Security. It will protect retirees. It will see to it that we do not have the fox guarding the hen roost. It will see to it that the hopes and the dreams and the expectations of our senior citizens and those who look forward to Social Security as protection in their retirement years can be assured that there will be a protection for them and that their Social Security benefits will be there when they retire. It also is to assure that within the structure of  Social Security there would not be an avowed and announced enemy of Social Security, of the program which protects our senior citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a fight which has been before the Congress many times. It's been before the Senate. It has been before the House. The American people have made it plain; they want Social Security protected. They have made it equally plain that they don't want people in charge of Social Security who want to destroy the program or who want to send it, as he has said, to the slaughterhouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that this is an amendment which you can safely vote for, secure in the knowledge that you are protecting the concerns of your Social Security recipients and of others who believe that Social Security is one of the great and wonderful programs in the history of this country. And you can, in so doing, see to it that this individual is inquired of properly of his attitude with regard to Social Security, and that we can address the question of how Social Security should be protected. Certainly  not by the insertion into the structure of the organization which runs it by a man who has consistently displayed hostility to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of the amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. In so doing, you are voting to remove an enemy from Social Security from a responsible position where he can do a great hurt. And you are assuring that you are protecting Social Security for our constituents, for our people, and for our Social Security retirees.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I think this amendment is somewhat inappropriate, and I say that at my own peril. I have great respect for the chairman of the Commerce Committee. He is a wise man, far wiser than I. He has been here for many, many years. He knows how to make a point. I think he has made it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm aware that this appointment is somewhat controversial, but the best way to get the Social Security Administration to perform as the Congress wishes is to pass laws and to bring them in for oversight hearings. I don't think that a rifle-shot cutting of one individual's salary is the right way to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm not intimately familiar in this case, but this type of amendment does cause me some pause. I can't recall in my years here any time when an amendment like this passed, although the chairman, who has been here far longer than I, could probably cite them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want to deal with this issue of recess appointment, let's do so in an authorizing bill and not in this manner. And for that reason, I would urge a "no" vote on this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Before that, his father played the same role. I am pleased to see that he is carrying on the tradition. For a moment, when the gentleman from Michigan explained this amendment to me, I had doubts about supporting it. But then I recognized the legitimacy of the gentleman's concern, especially because the gentleman in the Social Security Administration in question had been appointed through a recess appointment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I felt that that process was an indication of disrespect for the congressional prerogatives of this body, or I should say the other body. To express what I mean, I want to simply remind Members that several weeks ago when the amendment was offered by Mr. Emanuel to eliminate funding for the Office of the Vice President, I voted against that amendment because I thought that members of one institution in the government owe a certain degree of respect to the other institution, even if you  don't especially care for the policies of the people who run that institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Vice President and I talked about the issue, I told him that the reason I had voted that way was simply because there were at least some people in this body still left who respected other institutions of government. I wish that the administration had demonstrated the same respect for this institution when they allowed this gentleman in question to be appointed through a recess appointment without confirmation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a program as vital as Social Security is at stake, I think that rather than lecturing each other about how we find a middle road to solve long-term problems of that program, I think the best way to find that middle road is to walk it and to look for ways to cooperate institutionally with the other branch of government. That is certainly what the White House chose not to do in this instance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for that reason that I think that the gentleman's amendment is a wise one, because it reminds both bodies of the need to respect each other's prerogatives. Sometimes they need to be forcibly reminded of that which this amendment would do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I therefore urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment is very straightforward. It seeks to hold accountable title X grantees who do not abide by State laws that require notification or  reporting of child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape or incest. This issue is not a new one. In 1997, it came to light that title X grantees were not reporting rape, incest, sexual abuse, child abuse and molestations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response, Congress included language in the 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill to clarify that title X grantees are not exempt from State reporting laws. This language has been retained since that time. Unfortunately, despite this clarification, some title X grantees still do not appear to be reporting cases of rape and incest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 10th of this year, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported the story of two young ladies who were victims of sexual abuse. One young lady was continually molested by her father. The abuse began when the girl was just 13 years old. In November 2004, she was forced by her father to have an abortion. She says that she told an employee of the abortion clinic that she was being "forced to have sex and do things she didn't want to do." Despite this fact, no report was made. She was sent home with  her father to endure another year and a half of sexual abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In another case, a 14-year-old girl was taken by her 21-year-old soccer coach to have an abortion. She allegedly used a junior high school ID and her abuser paid for the procedure with a credit card and driver's license. The abuse was never reported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the story in the Enquirer regarding the second case that I mentioned, a form filled out by Planned Parenthood said, "Patient reports pregnancy is the result of sexual assault by a stranger. After consultation with attorney, report of a crime to the police was not made. Due to physician-patient privilege, we are prohibited from reporting as no severe bodily injury was reported."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The young lady's attorney says that prosecutors in four local counties know of no such exception in reporting requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It simply says that title X grantees who have been found by a Federal or State agency or a court of law to have violated State reporting requirements in the preceding 36 months cannot receive Federal title X funds. I urge support for my amendment.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Sec. 601. None of the funds made available in this Act for the National Institutes of Health may be used for activities under section 241(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 238j(a)).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, one of the things I am most proud of in my service in the Congress was the reauthorization on a bipartisan basis of the National Institutes of Health in the last Congress. It is the first time the NIH has been reauthorized in over 13 years. It is the stellar institution for health care research in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a part of that reauthorization, I promised the stakeholder community that I would support increased funding for NIH this year, and I have done the best I can to follow through on that commitment. Unfortunately, because of the press of funding that this particular appropriation bill has, the NIH increase in <bill type="h" number="3043">H.R. 3043</bill> is only 1.6 percent. I am glad that it is that much. I wish it were more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment before the body at this point in time would make sure that all of that money actually goes to the NIH. Sadly, a lot of the increase in NIH is going to be immediately siphoned off to two different funds. One is a global AIDS fund, which will take $300 million. The other is called a "tap," which takes about $600 million to another line item outside of NIH. So what this Barton amendment would do was keep that $600 million that would be siphoned off for the tap fund and keep it in  the NIH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not opposed to the amount that the appropriators have increased it. I wish it were more. But at least I want to keep as much of that money that has been increased within the NIH. That is what this amendment would do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I held up this sign from the well yesterday, and I will do so again today. I have the sign hanging in my office, and every time somebody comes in looking for money, I ask them to read it out loud. What the sign says is, "What do you want us to do for someone, besides yourself, that is more important than whatever it is you want us to do for you?" That request includes even medical researchers at universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the fact is, this bill contains $750 million over last year, and before that in the continuing resolution we added $620 million to NIH at that time. This bill is $1 billion higher than the President's request for the National Institutes of Health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, everybody loves the National Institutes of Health. I do too. But it does no good to any patient if we only concentrate on putting money in the National Institutes of Health and do not see to it that the information produced by the NIH is disseminated adequately to medical practitioners all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also does no good if in the process of squirreling away this money to NIH we do substantial damage to the public health programs of the United States and if we essentially wipe out the one agency which is doing the research to demonstrate to us how to produce the best treatments and how to produce cost savings that will prevent private medical care and Medicare from going bankrupt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This amendment has all of those problems. This country is consumed about out-of-control health care costs. This amendment would devastate funding for the one agency doing the research necessary to determine the best ways to deliver medical care in order to avoid bankrupting our health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment will also devastate the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health by cutting 20 percent of the funding provided for NIOSH, the only agency in government that supports occupational safety and health research and brings that research from the laboratory into the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do in this bill is what has been done for the last 16 years: We take a small percentage of the funds we appropriate to these agencies, and we set that aside for research and for evaluation so that we have a truly holistic approach to health care in this country. It does no good if we do lots of research in the lab and the implications of that research never get out into the doctor's office. It does no  good if patients aren't given  enough information so that they can question their own treatment. That is what this does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge strongly, in the strongest possible terms, the rejection of this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute in rebuttal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we are not talking about a small amount of money. The 2.4 percent tap transfer is almost $700 million. That is a lot of money when you are only increasing the NIH 1.6 percent, or $750 million. It doesn't make any sense to me to then take $700 million of that and give to other programs that have their own line items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the programs that the gentleman from Wisconsin talked about has $329 million in its own line item. So we are saying if you are going to increase the NIH, congratulations. We are for it. Let's keep the money in the NIH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Let me thank Mr. Barton, who has been a tremendous leader in medical research in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I couldn't agree with him more. I think this amendment is of extraordinary importance. I would ask every single Member of Congress to think about who comes into your office, and I guarantee no less than 30 percent, maybe 50 percent, are there for health reasons. They are concerned about cancer, they are concerned about heart, they are concerned about lung, MS, AIDS, whatever it may be. That is who comes into our office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to appropriate whatever funds are necessary in order to try to eliminate these diseases or to make these people's lives better who contract these diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand exactly what the gentleman from Wisconsin is saying. He is absolutely right. You do need evaluation, and you do need to be able to understand how to get this information out to the various people who are going to apply this information. I don't believe that is happening particularly well. I do not feel that $700 million is needed for that, and if it is, it shouldn't have to go through NIH and be taken away from NIH, which is what is happening now. It should go directly to HHS or  wherever else it needs to go in order to carry out that responsibility. There is a mixup, in my judgment, for these last 16 years in terms of how this funding is handled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is absolutely in order, and I would hope that every single Member of Congress who believes in medical research, and I think we all do, and who believes in helping our constituents will support this.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I will include a longer statement for the Record, but I would like to say that I align myself with Mr. Barton and Mr. Castle. Mr. Barton described the $700 million that is basically siphoned off the NIH budget. But there is $300 million in addition that goes to the Global Fund. Last time it was $99 million. In this, we are taking another $201 million and siphoning it to the Global Fund. Why not just give it to the Global Fund directly instead of  putting it into the NIH budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support of Mr. Barton's amendment, which will prevent funding from being transferred out of the National Institutes of Health and will effectively increase the NIH research budget nearly $700 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, 2.4 percent of NIH funding is reallocated for the Evaluation Tap, which provides nearly all the funding for the AHRQ (pronounced ARC), as well as some funding for CDC and SAMHSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This leads to nearly $700 million being removed from the NIH allocation each year. Coupled with the $300 million being transferred to the Global Fund, the NIH has already lost nearly $1 billion before it spends its first penny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not oppose funding these other agencies, but it seems to me if Congress deems this to be a priority, we should fund these agencies with their own line items in the budget, not survive by siphoning off funding from other agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not believe we should require the NIH to give up part of its budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I appreciate the Chairman and Ranking Member's work in this bill to increase funding for many of our critical health, education and labor programs, I was nonetheless disappointed by the NIH's relatively small increase of $750 million, or 2.5 percent. When the Global AIDS funding is transferred out, the increase is only $549 million, or 1.6 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Barton Amendment will increase the funding available for the NIH's core function--medical research that saves and improves lives. I strongly urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise as someone who has, for 25 years, as a member of the Labor-Health Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee serving with my friend, Mr. Obey, supported increases in funding at NIH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Castle is absolutely right. Many of those who come to our office want to make sure that we invest properly in the research and the basic biomedical research on disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Porter was the chairman of our committee when we doubled the funding of NIH. We did so, of course, over the objections of the Republican budgets, as you may recall, which is why John Porter voted against so many of the Republican budgets because he said it did not sufficiently allow him to do his job. We agreed with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I care deeply about the process of discovery at NIH that brings so much hope to all the world for conquering and curing so many diseases that afflict humanity. Let me be clear, this amendment does not help medical research in my opinion. Not because it doesn't give it some more dollars. We have had a billion dollar increase, as you know, over the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not question the gentleman's motive in offering this amendment. I do question the wisdom of the measure which is, after all, what debates are about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment takes away from the whole spectrum of research, and particularly our ability to translate the research results from that basic research to its application to prevent, treat and cure illnesses that afflict mankind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this amendment may sound good, as very frankly some of the amendments that have been offered before which say we are going to take from here and give to there, which sound good on the surface, all of us would like to give more money to NIH. Simply stated, we do not have, however, the luxury of supporting research  for the sake of simply having research if we do not translate it, have the statistical data available and the application. I take a backseat  to no one in supporting medical research, but to cut funding for other public health service agencies as proposed under this amendment is simply not good policy. It is not good for the health of our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would like to offer an amendment to increase funding for NIH without harming other health priorities, then certainly that should be discussed and supported. But let me note that this bill includes a $750 million increase in funding for NIH. I said a billion, which is a billion higher than the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are to take molecules and turn them into miracles, the research that all of us seek, then we must support the long-term quality of our research efforts. I have done so for the last, as I said, 25 years. It is important for us to do so. But I think, frankly, the gentleman's amendment will harm the objective that he ultimately seeks and that Mr. Castle spoke of and that all of us support. So I urge defeat of this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, Mr. Barton's amendment would increase NIH funding by $650 million by prohibiting NIH from contributing funding through the authorized program evaluation tap to support other Public Health Service agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee has already provided generous increases for NIH--$620 million in the joint funding resolution and $750 million in this bill. That has provided an increase of over 1500 new research grants. The bill's $750 million increase is over $1 billion higher than the President's FY08 request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is dangerous because it would eliminate the only agency that is doing research to evaluate and identify what healthcare treatments work, what is safe for patients, and how to control the costs for the medical interventions produced by NIH research--the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, AHRQ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty percent of our economy is tied to health care. 42 million seniors are dependent on Medicare for health care, and 50 million Americans are on Medicaid. We desperately need the research that AHRQ provides to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the health care services provided through this enormous share of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Comparative effectiveness research allows us to expand coverage by only paying for what works and using the savings to expand health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The country is concerned about being consumed by out of control health care costs. This amendment would devastate funding for AHRQ, the one agency doing the research necessary to determine the best ways to deliver medical care in order to avoid bankrupting Medicare and our private health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment will devastate the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, by cutting 20 percent of the funding provided for NIOSH--the only agency in government that supports occupational safety and health research and brings that research from the laboratory into the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 there were 5,734 workplace injury deaths, 50,000 deaths from occupational diseases and more than 4.2 million workplace injuries in the U.S. In 2006 we saw more than a doubling of coal mine fatalities in the nation's mines. Now is not the time to cut our investments in important health and safety research programs that are critical to our efforts to protect workers from job deaths, injuries and disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would devastate the CDC's ability to track the health status of Americans. Knowledge of, and the ability to understand issues such as infant mortality, obesity risk factors, and childhood diseases will be seriously curtailed if this amendment passes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this amendment on its face would appear to provide short-term benefits to university researchers, it would have dramatic and serious long-term consequences for the patients with conditions that NIH research addresses.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we have had a number of debates this evening over the subject of earmarks. I have been heard on that, and I have been happy to have been heard on this particular debate. And again, I know there are many worthy expenditures of funds when it comes to earmarks. I do not necessarily believe that they are all bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I must admit, until coming to the floor, I wasn't completely certain what the Minnesota Digital Public Media Archive was. Fortunately, the gentlelady from Minnesota was kind enough to come to me and explain to me exactly what the purpose of the earmark was. I enjoyed our conversation and I appreciated her courtesy, and I want to stipulate this is not a debate on whether or not the gentlelady has a noble purpose for these funds. As explained to me with her enthusiasm, I stipulate there is  a noble purpose for these funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not necessarily going to engage in a debate on whether or not the Twin Cities public television station in St. Paul can make good use of the money, the half a million dollars. I am sure they can, as explained to me by the gentlelady from Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I want to again make it very clear, and we don't have the time to debate each and every earmark, but every time we expend these funds we have to look at, number one, where is the money coming from, and number two, what is the fiscal health of our Nation. Already the Federal Government is spending over $23,000 per American family. This is only the second time since World War II that the Federal Government has spent so much money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And right now with just the Federal Government that we have, we are on a collision course to double taxes on the next generation. Don't take my word for it. Go to the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, or the conservative Heritage Foundation or the liberal Brookings Institute. They will all tell you the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are sitting here with an explosion of spending. Some will say, relatively speaking, this is a small amount of money. Relative to the Federal budget, it is a small amount of money. I am happy to stipulate that. But I still believe that earmarks, although a small portion of the Federal budget, tend to be a large portion of the culture of spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I have no doubt this is a worthy project, but I do note that the PBS television station, I believe, gets almost 85 percent of its funding from donations and other public grants. I am led to believe, and if I am incorrect, I invite the gentlelady from Minnesota to correct me, that they receive rather generous support from the taxpayers of the State of Minnesota. But I don't quite know what the compelling Federal purpose is, Federal purpose, money from Federal taxpayers, to fund the Minnesota  Digital Public Media Archive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look, this isn't a debate on whether or not this is a noble purpose for the money. It is not a debate on whether or not the gentlelady's public television station could do something good with the money. But let's remember where the money is coming from. As long as this Nation is running a deficit, which it is, is this money going to come from raiding the Social Security trust fund yet again, even though I have introduced and supported legislation that would protect that trust fund?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we run a deficit, we are still borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund. Or as we know in the Democratic budget resolution passed earlier this year, we have the single largest  tax increase in American history, over 5 years ramping up to an average of $3,000 per American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>More spending fuels more taxes. Are we going to increase that greater tax burden on present American families or are we going to pass on more debt to our children? Government will be paid for. This earmark will be paid for one way or another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so the question is not whether or not there's a noble purpose. The question is not whether or not they make good use of the funds, but is it a compelling Federal purpose, worthy of sending debt to our children, worthy of taking money away from the Social Security Trust Fund, worthy of being a part of the largest tax increase in history, and I respectfully submit to my colleagues that I believe it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

On no issue in my 7 years in Congress did I receive more calls from my constituents and from citizens around Minnesota than when the Republican majority tried to cut the funding for public broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Minnesota treasure their public television stations, and they support with their own dollars, with State dollars, and they look forward to support from a Federal commitment to ensure that excellent public television programming is available in Minnesota and around this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 50 years, Minnesota's award-winning public television stations have produced tens of thousands of hours of local and regional programs that capture our State's history, politics, daily life and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, these programs are stored in a physical tape archive. They're not stored digitally because they're old tapes. They're archived. They're locked away, and they're totally inaccessible to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At worst, these videotapes that are stored this way are physically deteriorating. That means these programs could be lost forever if they are not converted to a digital format.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about a public investment. Twin Cities Public Television is already investing in the process of converting its tape archive into a fully searchable digital archive. The project involves public television stations across the State: Duluth, Brainerd, Austin and Moorhead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the conversion is completed, all the information will be free and available to anyone, free and available to anyone at any time, anywhere, on the Internet. Programs like Newton's Apple, which was the Mr. Wizard of my children's generation, still has requests from teachers across this country to use those programs in their classrooms. At a time when we're trying to encourage our children to be captured, to be interested in science and math, Newton's Apple being available on the Internet,  free to our teachers, free to our families, will make America, I believe, have children more interested in science and math.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This digital archive will be an asset, as I said, for educators and students and all the citizens in Minnesota, not just in science and math but in history, arts and culture. People will be able to access, as I said, around the country and around the world, and I believe that the knowledge put forward by this type of innovative use of digitizing the old tapes will put our Internet to work for democracy around the world as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The challenge of preserving information and media for future generations is a 21st century problem, and Congress is just starting to address it. This is an issue for those of us on the Appropriations Committee. We heard time and time again from the Library of Congress and others in hearings this year about this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a public-private partnership in Minnesota to preserve public television programs, and this is one of the first of the kind in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota's effort will result in a best practices that can help other stations save two generations of American history and tens of millions of dollars. We will save dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important project that seeks to address a national problem. It will produce benefits far beyond Minnesota, and it will produce benefits long into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should be in the business of taking advantage of opportunities of partnering with States to solve problems that affect our country as a whole, and this is exactly what this project's all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a partnership to make the problem of saving our history and to turning it into an opportunity for our children and for our families to learn together about the richness of this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would strike $150,000 for the Burpee Museum in Rockford, Illinois, for educational programming and exhibits and, as mentioned, reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't want to take a lot of time on these amendments. I know a lot of people want to move pretty quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just say that I know the name, the Burpee Museum, lends itself to a lot of nice jokes about having dry heaves as a taxpayer and paying this or whatever else.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>I take personal offense to that. That's the name of the museum. Burpee was the name of an inventor of seeds.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I apologize.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>And after him. You should apologize. I accept your apology.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>None was intended. I was just hoping to shorten the conversation here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this museum began as a Works Progress Administration project in 1942. It's an old New Deal program. It's still around, and one might question why the museum is still receiving Federal funds, even though the Depression era has come and gone, and the WPA has long since closed up shop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke to the author of this amendment. I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Manzullo, and he explained some of the things I had a question about. One was a question about where the funding actually goes, was it to the Burpee Museum or was it to Northern Illinois University that has a paleontology department, and as I understand it, is lending staff to the museum. He clarified that, and I think I understand how that goes now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question is, and the gentleman points out as well and I'm sure he will in defense of this earmark, that this is an economically distressed area. There are many around the country, in every district in the country. If the entire district is not economically depressed,  certain areas of it are, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to try to discern by Members of Congress where funding should go and where it should not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I simply believe that it's not our place here to do this. In many cases, the accounts that we're earmarking are accounts that there is a competitive process at the Federal agency for the funds to be given out. By earmarking, we circumvent that process and we say, well, we know best so that we can decide who gets this funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't believe that that's right, and I believe that we should stop the funding for this earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is a very immodest request that's part of an overall strategy to revitalize an economically depressed area of downtown Rockford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The City of Rockford led the Nation in unemployment in 1980 at 25 percent. We lost 14,000 highly skilled manufacturing jobs at many of our over 1,500 factories in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this money does, it sets up a paleontology lab, which is an extension of Northern Illinois University, into the Burpee Museum of Natural History itself. This is astonishing because what it is doing, it's moving many of the assets of this great university to a city 30 miles away, and the reason that that lab has been created in Rockford is because of the incredible finds that were made by the university in terms of the paleontologist digs several years ago in Montana with regard to dinosaur  projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently eight Northern Illinois University faculty and 13 graduate and undergraduate students working on various cutting-edge physical science projects at the Burpee Museum. Thus, the request is ready to be used to support these research projects by Northern Illinois University students and staff utilizing the laboratories at Burpee Museum in Rockford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this assistance, Burpee Museum is becoming one of the foremost places in the world to study and view paleontology. What we lost with our manufacturing base we're trying to compensate for in an educational center and people coming to town in order to tour this great center. In fact, tourism is up by 7 percent as a result of the paleontology digs by the museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Besides that, the Institute of Museum and Library Services would receive this money, but there is no way to get it through the regular budget. The rules and regulations simply do not allow this type of project to be funded by it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Burpee Museum is a center for study. Students are coming from around the world. In fact, recently Burpee and Northern Illinois University co-hosted a scientific symposium. Almost 200 scientists from around the country and from China, Norway and Canada attended this important scientific meeting in Rockford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spend, probably, 75 percent of my time working on manufacturing issues. I was born and raised in Rockford. This was a city that refused to die. This was a city that refused to give up. This is a city whose citizens came together and said we have lost so many manufacturing jobs, but we're going to find another way to keep our kids in town to allow them to have jobs there so parents can see their grandkids, and unlike many Midwest towns that gave up, kids just leave the area because of no opportunities.  What we're doing here is the creation of this wonderful laboratory to study paleontology to help put Rockford back on the map again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this is extremely fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I'd simply repeat what I said. Virtually every district in the country can accurately say that certain parts of their district are economically depressed. We simply don't have enough money in the Federal Treasury to address all those needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So our decision is how do we adequately and equitably distribute funds to the Federal Government. If we make the decision that Federal agencies should fund these projects, then we should stick to the process that we have in place, and that process usually involves competitive bidding, for example. We don't want to give up no-bid contracts, but that's what earmarks by definition typically do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I don't think that that is proper here, and with that, I would urge an affirmative vote on the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the Institute of Museum and Library Services does not offer grants for conservation efforts such as what is going on at the museum. It's simply not available, and the issue is, do unelected bureaucrats who answer to no one in this city make all the decisions as to where the money is spent or do Members of Congress who are responsible to our electorate every 2 years have the ability to come in and say this is something worthy of the money that's going to be spent  anyway. Because the Flake amendment does not save money. It just puts more money back into the hands of the bureaucrats to spend wherever they should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would obviously oppose this amendment, and I would encourage my colleagues also to vote "no" on the Flake amendment to strike these funds.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $200,000 in Federal funds from being used for the Rhode Island College for development of a Portuguese and Lusophone Studies program and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just make a comment on the last comment that was made. It was said that we aren't saving money with these earmarks if we were to strike funding for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way these earmarks are structured, we reduce the cost in the bill by a consistent amount. So whether we save money depends on the Appropriations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any case, that's always what we are told, we will never save any money by striking funds for earmarks. That's simply not the case ever, because the Appropriations Committee could simply request less money the following year or the prior year, knowing that earmarks were going to be struck down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just say, with regard to this earmark, perhaps something was lost in translation. But my understanding is that this program has already been developed. Are we developing a program here that has already been developed, or is this a redevelopment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Web site, the Rhode Island College officially launched its Institute on Portuguese and Lusophone World Studies in October of 2006. The Web site states that the Institute of Portuguese and Lusophone World Studies is designed to be a nucleus of instruction and interaction for the benefit of its students and the larger Portuguese-speaking community of Rhode Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The certification letter submitted to the Appropriations Committee says that the money would be used for the Rhode Island College Lusophone Studies program. But since we don't have any further information, I guess we can assume, and I see that the sponsor of the amendment is here, and can clarify this, that the Lusophone World Studies is the intended recipient of the funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporters of the earmark will no doubt note that approximately 10 percent of Rhode Island's population is of  Portuguese descent. Through foundation donations and private contributions, over $620,000 has been raised to support the new program at Rhode Island College. In fact, Meredith Vieira, a well-known cohost of NBC's Today Show, and a Rhode Island native, serves as the national honorary chairperson of the Community Campaign for Portuguese Studies  Endowment Fund. Here is another case where there is a lot of money coming in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why in the world do we need to spend more Federal money on it? Why do we need an earmark to divert more funds from our Treasury to programs that seem to exist and subsist fine on their own? In many cases we supplant private or local funds that could be used for this purpose.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, education as a whole is something I don't think we can ever go wrong in investing in, especially at a time when education is more important than ever before in keeping our country competitive in a global economy. What's going to make our workers more competitive is their ability to compete on an international level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, part of that edge is going to be able to be determined whether they are going to be bilingual, whether they are going to be fluent in not just one language, but maybe two languages. It's interesting in our country, especially over the debate the last several weeks, denigrating immigration as if it's something of a drain on our society, that we have lost sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The greatest strength of our Nation are our immigrants, especially now. The United States is unique around the world in that we are a country of nations, nations that make up every part of the world. We are uniquely positioned as a Nation to take full advantage of the multiethnic backgrounds of all the people that make up this great country of ours. We have a ready-made market in every part of the world because of all of ethnicities that we have in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in my neighborhood, in Rhode Island, we have a large Portuguese community. The fact of the matter is, we have, in Rhode Island, a large Portuguese community that could be very beneficial to this country's ability to compete internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By 2010, Brazil will be the third largest consumer of American-made products. Now, don't you think it would be a smart move for our country to invest more in Portuguese literacy and fluency? I think so. That's why I am for investing in the language development for the third leading consumer market of American goods that's going to lead to more American jobs right in our hometowns all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about building up American jobs here at home. Frankly, I don't understand what the objection is. This is all about investing in our people. We are not running any deficits when we are investing in people. We are making investments, investments that are going to pay huge dividends in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where is your balance sheet?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, the cost of everything but the value of nothing. When you look at your balance sheet, you would assume that you can do everything on the sheet. You can just automatically have someone grow up, not get an education, expect to get more out of them than you put into them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know any business deal where a business person expects to get something more out of a deal than they put into it, except maybe Enron. Is that your kind of politics over there? You expect to get rich quick without even investing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know, as Democrats we believe that you have to invest in people before you can get a return on your investment. That's what we are doing in this investment in education. We are investing in our workers. We are investing in our people, because we know in order for us to get a return on our investment that is what's going to be the key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can give you specific examples in my State where we have bilingual workers who now are able to take what they have learned, thanks to these Portuguese studies, and also take that and be able to teach other people Portuguese and be able to add fluency to their vocabulary and also be able to expand their economic opportunities as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that's a good thing for this country. It expands the American Dream in this country, and that's why I oppose the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman is reminded to address his remarks to the Chair.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Again, I think something has been lost in translation here. I have no idea what this amendment has to do with Enron. This amendment is simply saying that the Federal Government need not spend money on this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Rhode Island College is a State university, it's my understanding. If the taxpayers in Rhode Island want to decide through their State representatives that it should receive more funding, then by all means it should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question is why are we coming here to the Federal Government with all the choices out there. The university that I went to, private university, teaches dozens and dozens of languages. I am sure they would like more funding, but it wouldn't be my place to come in and say, all right, let's have a big earmark for the Afrikaans program or the Chinese program or something else. I just don't think that would be proper. We can't do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last time I checked, we are running a deficit here, and we have a big debt. To try to fund all of these programs simply is not prudent. It has nothing to do with Enron. It has nothing to do with misplaced priorities elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has to do with whether or not the Federal Government should in this case fund an earmark that is circumventing the regular process of authorization and appropriation. There are programs out there through the Department of Education that award grants to universities that have language programs. This is circumventing that process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As a Federal Government, we have a responsibility to this country. Whether the person comes from one State or another is irrelevant. It's an investment in all of us to invest in this education.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I have been trying to figure out what to name this operation I have been watching, and I think we ought to name it "Operation Divert Attention."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard comments on a number of occasions now, when Members are offering amendments to strike these tiny items, we constantly hear, oh, we are running a deficit, we have to be fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if I am looking at the Record correctly, the gentleman offering this amendment voted to authorize the President to go to war in Iraq. If I take a look at the Record correctly, all three of the gentlemen who have been acting as the point men in going after these projects and in going after other small amendments today, all voted for the 2007 Republican budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out it is those budget policies, and those foreign policies, which have given us, counting the supplemental this year, $600 billion in borrowed money spent on the Iraqi war in a case of mistaken identity, where the President mistook that stocky fellow with the mustache, Saddam Hussein, for that tall fellow with the beard, Osama bin Laden, and hit the wrong country by mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say that the three gentlemen who voted for those Republican budget policies are the fellows who voted for tax policies that are watching $57 billion go out the door this year in tax cuts for millionaires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they try to recoup on the deficit front by saying, oh, we ought to  save a little piece here and a little piece there. If they had been as concerned about the fiscal impact of their actions, voting for past budget resolutions, and voting for past war resolutions, we wouldn't be sitting here with this deficit today, and this attack on these investments would be even more chuckle-producing than this episode.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I do have a number of comments I would like to make about this particular earmark. But before I do, I do feel compelled to address some of the comments by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I think the way to paraphrase what he just said is: You guys spend too much, so we will spend even more. I am not exactly sure about the logic of that particular argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also heard complaints about the war, something that has been debated on this floor, should be debated on this floor, will be debated on this floor. But I would note that the gentleman's party controls both the House and both the Senate; and if his party wants to end funding, they can do that tomorrow. His party is in control of this now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last, but not least, the distinguished gentleman complains about tax relief. Last I looked, don't take my word for it, go to the United States Treasury, we are awash in tax receipts. Tax relief has brought us in more tax revenue, because when you let the American people save more and invest more, they go out and they create and they grow the economy. So I think the gentleman's comments were very much misplaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking to this particular amendment; one, this particular amendment would eliminate the earmark of $300,000 in funds to the West Los Angeles Times College. From the certification letter, this is to establish a first-of-its-kind entertainment industry craft and technician college job training program to respond to the film and television industry's immediate need for new trained employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Previous to coming to floor, I did know a lot about this particular earmark. The sponsor of the earmark, the gentlelady from California, was kind enough to share with me information about it, and I became convinced of a couple of different propositions:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, that she has a very noble purpose for this earmark. Again, I want to stipulate to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, I came away, as I did with the last amendment, knowing that not only is there a noble purpose, I have no doubt that some good things could be done with this money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But like in many of these earmark debates, there tends to be great focus on the good that can be done with this money, but we don't spend a lot of time talking about the harm that can be done with this money. And I know that the gentlelady from California feels that low-income people within her district could benefit from this program. I have no doubt that that is true. But I might point out that there are very many worthy community colleges, for example, in the Fifth Congressional District,  who could benefit from this money as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eastfield College, we need a lot of people trained for our high-tech industry, for jobs with companies like Texas Instruments, companies like Raytheon. These monies could be used by Trinity Valley Community College. There are several locations within the Fifth District of Texas. They could help in our burgeoning nursery industry. It is a very agricultural part of my district. So, again, education is good. But the education is going to the one particular district in this particular case, not going  to the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. So there are many worthy competing goals for this particular money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I really want us to focus upon the fact that although I have no doubt that good things can be done with these funds, all of government must be paid for. And so, again, I think we should use this debate as an opportunity to focus on who is paying the bill. And, again, as long as this Nation is running a deficit and it is down, thanks to the fact we are awash in tax revenues due to tax relief, we are still running a deficit. That means that any earmark, not just the gentlelady's from California,  but any, is going to be raiding the Social Security Trust Fund as we continue, unfortunately, a practice from both parties of raiding the Social Security Trust Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we know that more spending fuels more taxes. And I hear from constituents in my district who have to pay the bills for all these earmarks no matter how worthy they are. I hear from somebody like the Flores family in Garland, Texas. She writes, "Dear Congressman, I am a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in daycare. An increase in taxes would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family. Please don't let this happen. Let's hold the budget down. There  are a lot of things I can't afford, so I don't buy them. I need government to take the same attitude."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At a time when more and more film production is moving offshore, this program ensures that L.A. retains its number one competitive advantage, the highest quality film production workforce in the world. In 1996, when we worked out the welfare reform program for California, we placed the retraining of those coming off welfare in the community colleges, and this is one of the programs that is located there, because we find that people who are returning to the workforce and our veterans, average  age 27 years, go to the community college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young people in Los Angeles County suffer from one of the highest rates of youth unemployment and violence in the Nation. At last count, the unemployment rate for young people in L.A. County was close to 12 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The On Location program creates opportunities for Los Angeles young people while supporting the most important industry to the southern California economy. This program makes sure that kids of average means can get the technical skills they need to get good jobs working in film and television production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier, I approached Mr. Hensarling, who announced his opposition in a press release, and explained  that the money in this project doesn't go to Hollywood studios, it goes to West Los Angeles Community College, and the program trains youth in the skills needed in this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could draw parallels to other community college programs in other people's districts, but I won't do that. So what we want to do is to use these Federal funds, because it is connected to the Federal welfare reform program, to allow this college to prepare our young people to work in an industry that really is the fuel to the economy. It is a $600 billion industry. It not only fuels the economy in California, but it fuels the economy nationwide. So, we need critical investments in education  and job training so that we can compete in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than seeking to defend the tax cuts for the wealthy, let us work together to support needed investments in job training like the effective On Location program that benefits the average family and the unemployed youth of California.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $150,000 in Federal funds from being used for the American Ballet Theater in New York for educational activities, and it would reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should point out that it has been said that if we don't spend this money, those faceless bureaucrats will just spend it. This actually reduces it. So it is up to the Appropriations Committee how that money is spent, not the agency itself. But I think that we could be facing the music if taxpayers learn that we are dancing away with their hard-earned money here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Ballet Theater has been home to some of the world's best dancers since 1939. I believe that it holds assets of more than $15 million, $15 million in net assets. Yet, we are being asked to fund $150,000, I believe, to expand outreach by completing in-depth residencies in small and medium-sized communities across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have an obvious love for the ballet. I am not sure if it is that obvious, but I do like culture, and I think it is good for everyone. But telling taxpayers across the country that they should pony up $150,000 for the American Ballet Theater, an organization that has over $150 million in net assets I think is just a bridge too far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many corporate sponsors involved in the American Ballet Theater, including American Airlines, Saks Fifth Avenue, Superfund Investing, Countrywide Financial. There are many well-known names on the board who contribute themselves. There is a Kennedy who is an honorary chairman; there is a Trump on the board as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of support out there for this organization. I just fail to see why the Federal taxpayers should be put on the hook for this as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Flake amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment which would cut funding to the American Ballet Theater, which is headquartered in the district I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the House of Representatives and the Senate showed their support for the American Ballet Theater by passing identical resolutions recognizing the American Ballet Theater's important role as cultural ambassador and America's national ballet company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An important part of ABT's mission is to expose as many people as possible to high quality ballet. This is at the heart of the request for studio company funding to bring ABT studio company and a host of educational and cultural programs to smaller communities that have limited economic means and access to these cultural benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Educational research strongly suggests that young people who learn about and participate in the arts acquire skills that help them in decisionmaking, problem solving, creative thinking, and teamwork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>An increasing number of studies also finds that art programs motivate young people to learn, assisting in improving performance in core academic subjects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some children, the arts provide the impetus to stay in school until graduation, and for others, inspire them to pursue a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arts education programs will continue to play an important role as the Nation struggles to improve high school graduation rates, develop pre-kindergarten programs, and counter the achievement gap in urban communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The requested funds will allow ABT to expand the studio program's outreach by completing in-depth residencies in small and medium-sized communities in five regions, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, South, Midwest and West. Bringing world-class ballet and education programs, they're a very important part of the ABT's key mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than simply offering performances, a studio company engagement leverages the company's resources to offer a range of educational activities and direct interaction with the company, often partnering with local ballet schools and universities to reach the local dance constituency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While visiting a community, the studio company works with dance departments within universities and supplies tickets and study guides to local K-12 schools, exposing young people to dance, encouraging movement, physical fitness, creativity, and concentration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Performing for local schools challenges youth to become more serious about the dance craft, while inspiring and expanding awareness of the possibilities for a career in the performing arts. The local arts community benefits from the experience of hosting ABT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It appears that my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona, does not support the arts and does not appreciate the importance of arts education to our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, the arts are critical to our children's overall education. Creativity can be taught. This funding allows those communities who do not have the access to the arts to gain the benefits of having world-class arts education brought to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a worthy project, and I hope my colleagues recognize its importance. I urge the defeat of my friend and colleague's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I find it curious when it's often said that the gentleman or somebody does not support the arts, does not support education. What would be said if there was a local individual, a philanthropist who gave $10 million to a local university, but did not believe that it was the Federal Government's place to do so? Would that person support education or not? If this is the standard by which people are judged, perhaps not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would submit that it's not a very good standard. Just because you don't believe that it's the Federal Government's place, in this case, to favor what is perhaps the best known ballet company in the country, with net assets of more than $15 million, over perhaps local ballet companies that could maybe use more support. How do we make that choice here? It just doesn't seem right to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have over 1,300 earmarks in this appropriation bill. I just don't know when Congress is going to draw the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the average American taxpayer, I would argue that this $150,000 to the American Ballet Company is too much, or in this case, maybe too, too much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman may not support the opportunity to bring the arts to small communities across the country that may inspire them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very much inspired as a young person, going to the ballet. In fact, I studied for many years to be a professional dancer until I crushed my leg in an automobile accident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what the gentleman does support, he talks about what he doesn't support. But what the gentleman did support was a budget that Clinton left President Bush, a surplus well over $5 trillion that has been squandered. And what this gentleman has supported is budgets that have given this country records, but they're the wrong kinds of records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now have a record debt over $8 trillion. Every man, woman and child in America owes over $29,000 personally to that debt. And this administration gave this country record deficits, the largest in the history of this country, and the largest trade deficit in the history of this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment prevents $150,000 from going toward programs at the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston, South Carolina, and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, when I saw this amendment, or saw this earmark, I thought I was experiencing deja vu here. In the past we've seen earmarks for other aquariums in other appropriations bills. Last year, the Mystic Aquarium received $1 million in the bill allocating funding for the Defense Department. And now we see the South Carolina Aquarium is a beneficiary in the spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This earmark may have found a more appropriate home in this spending bill rather than the Defense bill; but if I were a betting man, I would not bet against seeing other aquarium earmarks in other appropriations bills. It seems to be a trend here that the Federal Government seems to be funding more aquariums across the country, without, I would submit, much of a Federal purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Web site for the South Carolina Aquarium states that the purpose is to inspire conservation of the natural world by exhibiting and caring for animals, excelling in education and research, and providing an exceptional visitor experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This aquarium sells tickets for $16 for adults, $14 for seniors, $8 for children. It also has a sea turtle hospital, sustainable food initiative, which includes sustainable seafood recipe contests and a variety of exhibits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would ask, why do not all aquariums across the country receive similar funding? What is the criteria for picking winners and losers?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This aquarium seems to get favorable treatment over aquariums in Massachusetts, Colorado, Arizona, Kansas, as well as just about every other State. Is this a fair and equitable process?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, here, the case again is that the aquarium has a number of business partners and sponsors. The list reads like a who's who of Fortune 500 companies: BP, Whole Foods, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are the taxpayers being asked to be on the hook? Why are we asked to sponsor this aquarium as well?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the earmark I'm here to discuss and defend is for the South Carolina Aquarium located in my district in Charleston, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The South Carolina Aquarium is a nonprofit education and conservation organization that is truly part of the Charleston community. The aquarium is funded by a combination of tickets, concessions and souvenir sales and corporate, government and private funding. The aquarium has more than 80 paid staff, with a complement of more than 300 volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding from this earmark would go towards the development of user-friendly, interactive exhibits and displays, including touch tanks where children can interact with rays, horseshoe crabs, and many other native species from the waters of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding would also go towards funding a live feed connection so the children would be able to see into the inaccessible realms of the Hollings Marine Lab, and further development of the South Carolina Sustainable Seafood Initiative, which educates children on fisheries conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, funding for institutions such as the South Carolina Aquarium are worthwhile investments for the taxpayer. The reason is that with "seed money" organizations such as the South Carolina Aquarium are able to attract corporate donations which amount to much more than the original earmark and prove to be the foundations that our zoos and aquariums are built upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If my colleagues would like to research the criteria for projects under the Institution of Museum and Library Services account within this bill, the South Carolina Aquarium project is exactly why the Institute of Museum and Library Services account exists.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $100,000 from being used to fund educational and outreach programs at the Kansas Regional Prison Museum at Lansing, Kansas. I've often joked that the way we splurge taxpayer funds on thousands of earmarks is a crime. But this earmark gives that sentiment a little new relevance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It appears that Leavenworth County in Kansas uniquely hosts Federal, State, military and private prisons, and a regional prison museum is proposed to honor that heritage. This prison museum building would be in addition to the existing Lansing Historical Museum, complete with a gallows chamber, replicated cells and a 12- to 14-foot stone wall around the complex.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All told, it appears this prison museum addition would significantly increase the overall display area of the Lansing Historical Museum from roughly 1,500 square feet to nearly 8,000 square feet of display area. Here, I think it is a pretty clear case. It may have some local relevance, but asking taxpayers across the country to pay for a prison museum is probably not a wise use of funds here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kansas director of Americans for Prosperity, a grass-roots organization that focuses on taxpayer issues, called earmarking Federal funds for this project "wasteful Federal spending" and suggested that "if there is truly a market for a prison museum, people who find it interesting should pay for it, not the 99.9 percent of taxpayers who will never visit it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AFP, or Americans for Prosperity, also suggested that nontaxpayer sources of revenue could be found if there was adequate local support to build an economically viable prison museum in Lansing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First of all, Mr. Flake, I would certainly like to just say thank you so much for this opportunity. I've had a lot of people on both sides of the aisle say that this whole thing is a complete waste of time. And I personally just want to thank you for the opportunity to stand up and talk about Leavenworth County, Kansas. We don't get that opportunity enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Actually we have many prisons. We probably have more prisons in Leavenworth County, Kansas, than any other county in the United States. Let me tell you about three of them. Lansing, which is in Leavenworth County, hosts and houses the Kansas State correctional facility for the entire State. Then, of course, we have the United States penitentiary. It is an historic penitentiary, has got some names of people who have been housed there: George "Machine Gun" Kelly; the NFL running back Bam Morris;  Leonard Peltier; Fritz Duquesne, a Nazi spy; and Robert Stroud, who later became the Birdman of Alcatraz. So it has a huge history there. But it currently still houses close to 2,000 prisoners for the United States Government, Mr. Flake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then let me tell you about the detention barracks, which is part of Fort Leavenworth. Actually, for the first time in, say, 50 years, a unit from Fort Leavenworth was actually sent to Iraq because they were so expert in detentions and in handling these kinds of extremely difficult and sensitive issues that they went to Iraq to try to clean up some of the mess that was made by some of the detention problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Flake, I would just say to you that I don't think this is a joking manner in any way, shape, or form. It is very easy for you to go tell the people of Arizona that you are tough on crime. But let me say that it is a very difficult thing to do, and we take a great deal of pride about it in Kansas. It does take a lot more than talk to say that you are tough on crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The local residents are proud of their heritage and rightly so, and they see it as part of their responsibility to preserve this history. Let me talk about what they are doing. They are raising $2 million of private funds for this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am proud. And, again, I just thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about this. We are asking for $100,000 to add to this museum. But let me talk about one other thing. Mr. Flake, I don't know if you understand this.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman must address her remarks to the Chair.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, real life corrections work is sometimes dangerous, and it involves loss of life and injury. This memorial, this museum, will actually be a memorial to those fallen who have, again, at the U.S. penitentiary as well as our State, as well as our fort, and the detention barracks that are there, this memorial will offer an appropriate tribute to the sacrifices that these people have made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, it is very, very easy to say that we are tough on crime. The men and women who do the corrections work in Leavenworth County, Kansas, understand that it takes a heck of a lot more than talk to get behind this and be tough on crime to be able to do what we know needs to be done in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am glad to have the opportunity to stand up here. Leavenworth County has a rich tradition. We were part of the border wars when it came to the settling of one of the biggest issues in this country about slavery. We have the United States penitentiary, which is just so intense in its history. We have the Leavenworth, which has played a huge role in keeping our country safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate this. We would like as many people to come. This is going to be a tourist attraction, and we are inviting as many people as we can to Leavenworth County, Kansas, while we are building this museum and certainly as well as after it is built.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, again, I don't want to diminish the need that the locals feel to have this museum. People around the country have varying needs and wants for museums, whether it is a teapot museum in North Carolina or a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Ohio. Local needs are such and people visit and tourists find that interesting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But why should the Federal taxpayer be on the hook? When do we say, is there a time at which we say enough is enough, we can't handle any more? Thirteen hundred earmarks. Yes, it is down from the heyday of 2005, and I make no excuses for my own party for doing that. But is it right? When should we say enough is enough and simply say we shouldn't be using Federal taxpayer dollars for these kinds of projects?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Again, Madam Chairman, I would just reiterate that the people of Leavenworth County, Kansas, are proudly working hard to raise $2 million of private funds.

And, again, I am very proud to do this on behalf of Leavenworth County, Kansas, and invite everyone to come see the rich tradition that makes Leavenworth County a great place.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would eliminate $150,000 in Federal funds for the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois, for exhibits and community outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shedding some light on earmarks like this should be one of Congress' top initiatives, and I am glad that we have this opportunity to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The certification letter I submitted to the Appropriations Committee by the Member sponsoring the project stated "the funding would highlight the Great Lakes aquatic ecosystem and incorporate community outreach, team mentor and stewardships program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the second largest indoor aquarium in the world containing 8,000 animals, 650 species. An "all access pass" for admission is $23 for adults and $16 for children, and this aquarium gets 2 million visitors annually. According to the Charity Navigator, annual revenue for the Shedd Aquarium in 2004 totaled over $50 million. This is revenue in 2004 totaling $50 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004 alone the Shedd Aquarium had over $215 million in net assets and nearly $13 million in excess revenue. Let me read that again. In 2004 alone the Shedd Aquarium had over $215 million in net assets and nearly $13 million in excess revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why in the world, please tell me, are we giving 150,000 hard-earned Federal tax dollars to a local aquarium that has $13 million in excess revenue in 1 single year? It simply doesn't seem right to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Shedd Aquarium has applied for and has received at least four competitive IMLS grants in the past, but this earmark skirts that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we often talk about how we know more about our districts than some faceless bureaucrat in some agency. Well, those faceless bureaucrats in some agency awarded four grants to this institution. But that wasn't enough. They were back for another earmark, where apparently maybe they didn't get the grant this year; so we are going to earmark funds for the organization. Why do we set up a competitive grant program in a Federal agency and then say we are going to go around it by issuing an earmark?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes we give earmarks to organizations that fail to get a grant, that fail the competitive process that we have ordered the Federal agency to establish. The oversight process dictates that we actually call in Federal agencies if we don't like the processes that they have set up and tell them to set up a new process or we deny them funding. And for those of us who say that they won't talk to us or those Federal agencies are nonresponsive, cut their funding for a while and see how responsive  they become. That is our role, not to compete with the Federal agencies in how we can spend taxpayer dollars without competitive bids or without a process in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I see that those who sponsored the amendment are here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I was listening to my friend from Arizona, which is a State with a desert that has both Lake Powell and Lake Havasu that have been built with Federal money so they can have water. Talk about Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes, the largest body of freshwater in all of America, in fact, 90 percent of the freshwater in the United States, 20 percent of the world's freshwater. Thirty-seven million Americans get their daily drinking water from Lake Michigan and other  Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Shedd Aquarium, as you noted, has more visitors, 2 million people, in fact, people from Arizona come to see the Shedd Aquarium. More people visit that aquarium than any other aquarium for the last 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program actually has bipartisan support, as you probably know, in the Commerce, State, and Justice bill. My good friend from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), a Republican, got resources to help the Shedd Aquarium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason we are doing this, and you may not have known this and obviously those of us in the Great Lakes States care greatly about it, but BP, British Petroleum, the other day has gotten a waiver now to dump more untreated ammonia in the Great Lakes. It is our greatest national treasure like Yellowstone Park, like the Grand Canyon and others. The freshwater that surrounds Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio is a great national treasure. It provides, as I  said, 37 million Americans with their daily drinking water. And the Shedd Aquarium educates other people to the importance of the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I always noted the State of Arizona actually had a plan on the books, and I think got an earmark for this once, how to build a pipeline from the Great Lakes to provide water to Arizona. You have got a desert; we have got the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), who has been a supporter of the Shedd Aquarium.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this amendment because he is exactly right. A detailed review of the Shedd Aquarium shows that it has now become the center for Great Lakes advocacy. We are in the middle of a battle to stop the increase in ammonia and wastewater dumping by British Petroleum, the first new polluter in Lake Michigan. The Shedd is the fort with which we advocate for this protection of the crown jewel of the Midwest ecosystem, and I think this is an essential way to  go  forward to make sure that we protect the drinking water for over 30 million Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to my colleague from Illinois (Ms. Bean).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400631" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I acknowledge that the Illinois delegation on a bipartisan basis has supported this project. And this project, unlike the one that my colleague from Arizona mentioned, isn't a typical aquarium project. This is focusing on resources that highlight the importance and fragility of our Great Lakes aquatic ecosystem from the Dunes to Chicago's unique urbanized lakefront to the Illinois Beach State Park, where this interactive saltwater and freshwater aquatic biology lesson can take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This has bipartisan support. It is timely, given BP's recent announcement that it has received a permit to dump 1,500 pounds of ammonia and almost 5,000 pounds of sludge into Lake Michigan every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to defend this request to protect our largest source of drinking water, not just in Illinois, not just in the country, but in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And my colleague from Arizona and from States like Colorado, who are experiencing severe water shortages, should want us to make sure that we're educating our community how to defend this important national resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also suggest that, while I respect the gentleman's concern for fiscal responsibility that he shows on this $150,000 request out of a $150 billion bill, he didn't show such restraint in rolling back subsidies to the oil and gas industry for $14 billion earlier in the year. I would suggest that he look elsewhere to promote fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think the gentlelady may want to check the Record with regard to an energy bill. I'm not familiar with any that I voted for because they are hugely corporate subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me just say one thing. Charlie brought up, well, you're from Arizona. The Central Arizona Project, the big Federal project, or the Glen Canyon Dam in the 1950s was built largely with Federal funds, as if these were some earmark slipped into a conference report 3 days before the bill came to the floor. Not at all. I mean, no projects were debated more. Nothing went through more authorization, appropriation and now oversight than those projects. I may have voted differently if I were around  in the 1950s, but I wasn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we're debating here is whether we should spend $150,000 in Federal funds for a local aquarium in Chicago that in 2004 had $215 million in net assets, $50 million in total revenue, and $13 million in excess revenue. That is the question before us. We can talk about Enron. We can talk about the war. We can talk about anything, but this is what's relevant here, whether the taxpayer should be spending $150,000 for an aquarium, a local aquarium that had $50 million in revenue in 1 year alone.  It simply doesn't seem right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Here it states, "37 million Americans get their daily drinking water." It's the largest body of fresh water in North America. In fact, it's 90 percent of the water as it relates to body water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that effort, this is a bipartisan effort because we are dealing with the contamination of the Great Lakes, and the Shedd Aquarium is at the forefront of preserving and helping us make sure that the Great Lakes are here for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the reason the Hoover Dam and other projects are relevant here, not the process about how they were authorized or appropriated, Arizona still seeks Federal subsidies for its water rights, which we still subsidize.</paragraph>

  <narrative> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. __X. (a) Limitation on Use of Funds.--None of the funds in this Act shall be available for the Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest, Forest, Virginia, for expansion of exhibits and outreach.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) Corresponding Reduction of Funds.--The amount otherwise provided by this Act for "Institute of Museum and Library Services--Office of Museum and Library Services: Grants and Administration" is hereby reduced by $200,000.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $200,000, and reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount, from being used to expand the exhibits and outreach at Jefferson's Poplar Forest in Forest, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I'm sure that Thomas Jefferson himself would appreciate the sentiment about this, but I'm not sure the earmark is consistent with the Jeffersonian philosophy of "limited government," particularly limited Federal intrusion. He talked about a wise and frugal government in his 1801 inaugural address. I'm not sure that this sits well with that philosophy, spending Federal money, $200,000 in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poplar Forest is an octagonal house, an acreage that was inherited by Jefferson's family. They used it as a retreat in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Now, I won't take too much time on it, but suffice it to say there is a lot of local support for something like this. It sounds like a great house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I enjoy going to Monticello and visiting the sites of Thomas Jefferson. I'm sure that this is a fitting reminder of his life work and historical importance, along with a lot of other things that we have. But here again, there is an infinite need around the country for money for projects like this. If you simply ask the sponsoring Members, if you say that it's needed for economic development or tourism, what earmark would ever fail with that kind of criteria? We simply have to have a higher standard  here. Does it have a Federal nexus? Can we afford it? Is it consistent with limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility? That's what we should be asking ourselves here.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this amendment on behalf of the gentleman from Virginia's Sixth Congressional District, Mr. Goodlatte. He is involved in the markup of the Agriculture bill this evening, and so I would like to place this statement in the Record on his behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, for Members not familiar with Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest in Bedford, Virginia, the House was designed in 1806, and the grounds are located about an hour south of Charlottesville in the heart of central Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This investment of Federal funds will allow the landmark to open to the public 50 acres of hallowed ground once roamed by this farmer, diplomatic, meteorologist, President, and author of the Declaration of Independence; indeed, America's first Renaissance man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poplar Forest was an important part of Jefferson's life, a private retreat situated far from the public scrutiny and demands on our Nation's third President. It was his most personal architectural creation and landscape, a place where he came to find rest and leisure, to rekindle his creativity, and to enjoy private time with his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poplar Forest was also a working plantation, critical to his efforts as a farmer. In fact, the area around Poplar Forest is where Mr. Jefferson was forced to retreat while being pursued by British troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, scholars and historians work on restoring the home to its original design and conduct archeological research on the farming, landscaping and slave life of the grounds. While the staff at Poplar Forest continues to restore the historic land and house, they  are working on the first steps of developing the retreat for public use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As is the case with other historic Presidential sites, it will take time to tap the extraordinary potential of Poplar Forest to provide even more insight into one of America's most influential and public figures whose ideas still influence world debate and even govern rules of decorum on the House floor this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, while I share the gentleman's desire for fiscal responsibility, I will inform him that the private sector has furnished 84 percent of the funds it has taken to bring Poplar Forest's rescue and development through the initial stages. However, given the clear national role that Thomas Jefferson's legacy plays in our cultural heritage, I believe that Federal investment is prudent. It is vital to preserve this national treasure, which is listed on the National Register of Historic  Places, so that all Americans can continue to learn about Jefferson's life and his vision for the future of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer this for Mr. Goodlatte. I'm sure he would be here, but duty calls at the Agriculture Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, to end this debate tonight on these earmarks, I would just say that there has not been one earmark that has been challenged here tonight that isn't going to a valuable organization as far as I'm concerned. The question is not is there value in that organization or is there value in what this aquarium or what this historic site is doing. The question is should we be paying for it at the Federal level. And I think that's what taxpayers have a hard time with, and I think  they should, particularly given the fiscal problems that we're having at the Federal level.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman Obey for including $50 million for treating the health needs of 9/11 first responders from all over the country in this bill. Without his leadership, the heroes of 9/11 would still be waiting for the Federal funding they so desperately need for medical treatment following their work at Ground Zero. Although this funding is an important step, we need so much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this morning the New York Times revealed a new study by the Department of Health and Human Services that says that the cost of treating 9/11 illnesses will reach $20 million a month, $20 million a month by the end of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government must drastically increase its funding commitment if it is to fulfill its obligation to those suffering the health effects of 9/11. But today's bill is at least a first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all heard the harrowing stories of those first responders, firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians and countless others from all around the country who responded and put their own lives in danger to save others. But they are not the only victims of the environmental disaster that resulted from the attacks on the World Trade Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The toxic mixture of asbestos, mercury, benzene, dioxins, jet fuel and other harmful substances landed inside apartments and schools and office buildings. The dust settled onto furniture and carpets and onto curtains and air ducts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before buildings in Lower Manhattan had ever been tested to insure that they were safe to reoccupy, residents were urged by the EPA to return to their homes near Ground Zero, and students were sent back to school, where they breathed poisonous dust for months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Residents and students followed EPA instructions to clean up the dust in their apartments with a "wet mop or a wet rag," a completely inadequate, not to say illegal, method for cleaning up asbestos and other toxic materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students at Stuyvesant High School returned to a building that sat next to enormous piles of toxic debris being carted off to landfills. To this day, there has been no comprehensive testing or cleanup of World Trade Center dust in buildings in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and Jersey City. More than 5 years later, an increasing number of residents and students are now becoming ill from 9/11 toxins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Residents and students, in addition to first responders, should be eligible for 9/11 health funding as our colleagues in the Senate seek to do but this bill does not do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had planned to offer an amendment that would have made residents and students eligible for 9/11 health funding, too. I will not offer that amendment tonight, but I will express the hope that the chairman will support, as we go forward, the work to provide treatment to the tens and thousands of residents and students who are now suffering and will suffer the health effects of 9/11. And I hope we will accede to the Senate version of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a separate matter, I would also like to say that I am extremely pleased to see that $39 million has been included in this bill for arts and education. In past years I have had to offer amendments to add funds in this area, but for the first time we have a bill before us that does a very good job in arts and education. The funds provided in this bill are vital as they bring the arts to schoolchildren across the country, many of whom would otherwise have no other opportunity to experience the  arts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again thank the chairman for his initiative in this respect.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind my good friend and colleague from New York City that I too am a New Yorker and that I was there with a number of Members of Congress and the President after the attack occurred, and I spent a good deal of time talking with the workers, construction workers, the telephone company people, the police and firemen. And the impression of their sacrifice and their commitment to those people who were lost that day was burned into my memory.  Ever since that day, it has been a priority of mine to make sure that those individuals were provided for in every way possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just want to remind my colleague from New York City that I, as a member of the New York delegation from Syracuse, care very deeply about those individuals and providing these funds in this bill was a very high priority of mine, and I thank the chairman for working with me on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first let me thank our chairman for yielding and just say to him once again thank you for a bill which really does make the forward-thinking investments in our Nation that we so critically need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The values of a country are really demonstrated through its funding priorities, and I think when you look at this subcommittee and the priorities of it, we can really determine what our great Nation values as being a priority. So let me, even though I talked for a few minutes yesterday, I want to make a few general remarks about some additional issues that this bill addresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me just briefly discuss how this bill addresses the dropout crisis that this Nation is facing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty years ago the United States was number one in the world in terms of high school graduation rates. Today it ranks seventh. About one-third of the students who enter ninth grade each fall will not graduate from high school within 4 years, if at all. High school students living in low-income families drop out of school at six times the rate of their peers from high-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dropout rates are especially high in communities of color. Only about 55 percent of African American students and 52 percent of Hispanic students graduate on time from high school with a regular diploma, compared with 78 percent of white students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in my district in Oakland, California, which is not unlike other districts in urban communities, the graduation rate for African American males is 26 percent, mind you, 26 percent. That is about a 75 percent dropout rate, compared to 57 percent of the graduation rate for white males, which still is deplorable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do better by our children. Nothing less than the future of this country is at stake. Yes, black and Latino and low-income children deserve a piece of the American Dream also. That is why I am so pleased that this bill recognizes that and invests in dropout prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes millions of dollars to increase elementary and secondary counseling, a $40 million increase in TRIO, $20 million in GEAR UP. Also we add $125 million in 21st Century Community Learning Centers for before and after-school programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me just mention and highlight the 77 percent increase in comprehensive school counseling, which involves making sure that our teachers are freed up to do what they do best, and that is teach. This increase allows for counselors, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists to really help in our schools in terms of making sure that young people who are demonstrating the need for intervention early on receive the type of assistance  before the  situation gets out of control. This is so critical in terms of school safety because, of course, many of the issues that we have witnessed around the country in terms of violence on campuses, if we had just intervened earlier with the proper support staff, counselors, social workers, those situations may not have occurred. So I am very pleased that we have an increase for our counseling program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another critical issue facing many of our communities is the issue of re-entry and ex-offender programs, which this bill recognizes and makes a modest increase with a little bit over $26 million in reintegration and ex-offender programs and real focuses on youthful offenders. We must do everything to prevent, I mean prevent, the vicious cycle of recidivism in this Nation, and that means working to ensure that re-entry programs are available. So this bill recognizes that employment and mentoring  and transitional services do reduce recidivism and help individuals stay out of jail. So this provision is an excellent crime prevention measure which also helps formerly incarcerated individuals get their lives together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of HIV/AIDS, of course, this bill provides important increases in funding for our domestic HIV/AIDS programs. Specifically, the addition of $100 million for the Ryan White CARE Act and the additional $3.5 million is especially welcomed given the largely flat funding we have had for this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The state of emergency in my district is a state of emergency as it relates to the African American community and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We need really to declare a state of emergency nationally. We need a Federal state of emergency as it relates to HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me just say thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing the fact that there is a disparity in the rates of unemployment in the black community and in the Latino community and in the Native American community and for directing the Secretary of Labor to develop a specific plan to develop these disparities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much for a great bill, Chairman Obey.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Amendment offered by Mr. Davis of Kentucky:</narrative>
  <narrative> Page 125, after line 2, insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. 522. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to pay a bonus or other performance-based cash award to any employee of the Social Security Administration or the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services who holds a position to which such employee was appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or a Senior Executive Service position (as defined by section 3132 of title 5, United States Code).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would restrict funds allocated in this bill from being used to pay a bonus or other performance-based cash award to any employee of the Social Security Administration or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who is a presidential employee or a member of the Senior Executive Service. Neither agency would ever survive as a private business trying to make a profit based upon their constituent service abilities  which are often inefficient and inept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The premise is simple. Bonus pay is for exemplary work. It is my opinion that the American people are not getting exemplary work from the SSA and the CMS. Therefore, the management of the agency, as in the private sector, should not be eligible for bonus pay and should be accountable for their performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of 2006, my office received a call from a concerned constituent who was having a problem with the withholding of Medicare part D premiums from his Social Security check. After an intensive investigation by my staff, we discovered that this was a widespread problem that affected hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who have changed their prescription drug benefit plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After enrolling in a Medicare prescription drug plan during early enrollment and arranging for his premium to be deducted from his Social Security check, my constituent determined that his initial choice of a plan didn't fit his medical needs. He then decided to change his plan and his payment method, opting this time for direct payment instead of deduction from his Social Security check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, when he received his check, he realized that his premium for his initial selection was still being withheld. He attempted to address these problems himself with both CMS and SSA. He worked with them for 3 months without success. After contacting my office, my constituent liaison had more than a dozen exchanges with CMS and SSA over the next 6 months. Repeatedly, he was told by one agency that it was the other agency's fault. Several times he was told that the problem had been resolved  and it would be reflected in the next Social Security check but never was. By this time our constituent had to live within an enormously reduced Social Security check for 9 months. My office had actively engaged on his behalf for 6 months, and my constituent is frustrated and angry. CMS and SSA say it is not their problem, and my constituent's hard-earned money is unaccounted for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Social Security Administration was able to stop paying the plan provider by April of 2006, which is still an outrageously long period of time, then surely they would have been able to stop the withholding of the plan premium for my constituent 10 months after the fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is not only unacceptable; it is outrageous. For the millions of seniors in Kentucky and across the country that live on a fixed income or who are struggling to make ends meet, unnecessarily withholding these funds can create serious cash-flow problems. It is inappropriate to reward management of these organizations for taking money away from our seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the roll-out of a program as large as Medicare part D, there are bound to be bumps in the road. That is completely understandable. However, that it should take 11 months to resolve an issue like this is incomprehensible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This story represents only one of the most egregious examples. The problem is not one of individual case managers in the departments but rather a systemic inefficiency and cultural problem, bureaucratic attitudes that involve shifting blame as opposed to working actively to take responsibility for problems in their departments and then solving them. It often requires multiple inquiries and sometimes several months to even get a status update on a case. Getting to the root of the issue and fixing  a problem can take upwards of a year. This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I wanted to offer would have conditioned the payment of bonuses based on reports to Congress by both agencies detailing how they are addressing these issues. Unfortunately, the Parliamentarian has informed me that such an amendment would constitute changing existing law in an appropriations bill and be subject to a point of order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I am offering only a straight prohibition against the payment of bonuses for the coming fiscal year. I think this is something that both sides of the aisle can agree on. It is my sincere hope that the chairmen and ranking members of the Appropriations, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce Committees will work with both agencies and with me to improve the service delivered to our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are going to receive performance-based bonuses, then I think your performance needs to be exceptional. When we are causing seniors frustration and unnecessary problems with their hard-earned money, I don't view that as a satisfactory performance, let alone performance that should be rewarded with a taxpayer-funded bonus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, if you believe that the performance of CMS and SSA exceeds your expectations, then you should oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, if you believe, as I do, that both agencies are performing well below expectations in meeting the needs of our senior citizens, then I urge you to support my amendment to prohibit bonus pay for those responsible for running these agencies in the coming fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered would not permit the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the Social Security Administration to pay a bonus or performance-based cash awards to Presidential appointees who are not eligible for bonuses, or to senior executive personnel who are, by definition, eligible for bonuses. Frankly, I don't understand why the gentleman would want to stop CMS or SSA from awarding employees who are eligible for bonuses if they're achieving exemplary performance.  The fact is that senior executive service personnel are specifically eligible for bonuses and are paid on the basis of performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman's amendment would overturn the entire personnel policy of the agencies. And I really don't think that makes much sense on the basis of a 10-minute debate at 10:30 at night, especially when this matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. This is something which ought to be dealt with by the authorizing committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm sure that many Members have frustrations with the performance of many agencies from time to time, and I'm sure sometimes we're pulling our hair, but that doesn't mean that we ought to have an across-the-board policy that penalizes people across the board because someone didn't perform up to someone else's standards. So, I would respectfully urge a "no" vote on the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be happy to work with the gentleman. If there is a specific problem which can be ironed out by talking to the agency, I would be happy to help in that respect. But I don't think I will overturn the entire personnel policy of the United States for these people because one Member, on the basis of a 10-minute debate, thinks that that ought to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the distinguished chairman's comments and perspective on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing that I would share is I think we're dealing with some cultural challenges in the customer service responsiveness of many of the agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes in this Chamber, we highlight the poor performance of private corporations in their management, but having worked in helping businesses turn around and reform their practices, one of the things that I've noticed, especially in corporations that are successful in transforming their culture, the executives, the management leadership at those corporations, take personal responsibility and have a significant personal stake in the performance of every level of their department. I think  this requires across-the-board change.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Section __X. (a) Section 9320(k) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 1395k note), as amended by section 6132 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, is amended by adding at the end the following:</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment deals with critical access hospitals and their ability to provide crucial surgical services to rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, three of these hospitals in my district have fallen prey to a narrow interpretation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that now prevents them from providing basic surgical services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CAH program was created as a Federal reimbursement system for small rural hospitals. Providing cost-based reimbursement through Medicare allows CAHs to be a vital part of the safety net for my small communities in my district. This reimbursement allows these rural hospitals to provide both emergency and primary care services for the elderly and disadvantaged. In particular, CAH reimbursements for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists enable tens of thousands of citizens in medically underserved  areas to access surgical services every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until December 31, 2006, the CAHs were being reimbursed for CRNA services. Now, in 2007, a new interpretation of the law excludes CAHs whose counties have gone through a reclassification process due to a new census process known as "Lugar counties."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No new law has said that these CAHs should no longer be reimbursed for CRNA services, however. Now CAHs are being denied their CRNA pass-through payments. Most hospitals affected expect to average losses between $45,000 and $100,000; a drop in the bucket in overall health care dollars. But to these hospitals, this effectively terminates their ability to provide emergency surgical services. My amendment would fix the law to ensure that if a hospital is designated as a critical access hospital,  then it is reimbursed for CRNA services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress intended for CAHs to assist rural communities with limited access to health care services. I am committed to rectifying this unfair and harmful application of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, let me simply say I would like to be helpful to the gentleman, but my problem is that the gentleman's amendment, I believe, is subject to a point of order.

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to provide an additional $1,274,000 for programs making up the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, a modest increase for a vital public health program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Congressional Brain Injury Task Force is extremely grateful for the increased funding for both the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to address these needs of our injured servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TBI is a civilian epidemic as well. 5.3 million Americans currently living with a long-term disability as a result of TBI and the 1.4 million new TBI cases occurring each year at an annual cost of $60 billion clearly illustrate Congress' responsibility to provide adequate funding for the TBI Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The TBI Act is the only Federal law that specifically addresses this major public health problem, provides a foundation for State health departments and Federal agencies to combat the Nation's leading cause of disability for children and adults. Without adequate funding, the program and the progress made to date will be jeopardized, thereby diminishing the Federal investment during the last 10 years and severely limiting the Nation's ability to address the complex needs of individuals with traumatic  brain injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funding for the Traumatic Brain Injury Act will help strengthen and improve State systems, preserve and strengthen families, foster community living, and assist States in preventing traumatic brain injury.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would restrict funds in the bill from being used to fund the Random Student Drug Testing program run by the U.S. Department of Education. The amendment would allow, however, the evaluation of the program being conducted by the Department to continue, and if the evaluation shows that the program is cost effective, the funding would be restored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past several years, the Department has been using money designated for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program to conduct random school-based student drug testing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The problem is, Madam Chair, that this program has been studied and found ineffective. In 2003, the National Institute on Drug Abuse conducted a study that found that there was no difference between drug use in schools that tested for drugs and those that did not. The study found that the drug testing at schools did not affect either the prevalence or frequency of drug use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, such testing is very expensive. The cost of these tests can range between $10 and $75 each. Indeed, one school conducting random drug testing found that only a small fraction of its students actually tested positive, resulting in a cost of over $3,000 for every positive result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would prohibit money from being spent on the drug testing program until the program has been shown to be cost effective, because we should not be spending taxpayer dollars on programs that are not cost effective. At this point, the drug testing program has not been proven to meet that standard. This amendment would prohibit the Department from wasting the taxpayers' money on student drug testing until the Department shows that the program is cost effective.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment that I am offering along with the gentleman from Ohio, Representative JIM JORDAN. This amendment would ensure that none of the funds made available in this act may be used to establish or implement any requirement that individuals receive vaccinations of the human papillomavirus, or HPV, as a condition of school admittance or matriculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially, the amendment would serve as an incentive to States to keep HPV vaccination programs voluntary and not mandatory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at least 24 States have entertained legislation which takes the unprecedented step of requiring young girls to be vaccinated against HPV. I say "unprecedented" because HPV is not a communicable disease. It is not mumps. It is not measles. You don't get it by sneezing or sharing a juice box over recess. HPV is, in fact, a sexually transmitted disease. As such, vaccination should not be mandatory to attend school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Madam Chairman, we urgently need to address this issue. The Commonwealth of Virginia has already enacted a vaccine mandate into law. The District of Columbia City Council has passed one that is awaiting congressional action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, there are many reasons parents and students might object to mandatory HPV vaccination, from age appropriateness, indeed, initially, in the State of Texas it was going to be required for admission to middle school for fifth and sixth graders, and concerns over vaccine safety. I could go on. But whatever the reason, it is a discussion for parents and physicians, not legislators and bureaucrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, excluding children from school for refusal to be vaccinated for a disease that is spread only by sexual intercourse is a serious, precedent-setting action that trespasses on the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children, as well as on the rights of children to attend school. A mandatory HPV vaccine program improperly and unnecessarily inserts the government into lives of children, parents and physicians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American College of Pediatricians is opposed to it. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is opposed to it. We need to make sure that these programs are not mandatory.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am willing to accept the amendment on this side of the aisle because we think that while it is well-intentioned, it has no impact. I would like to explain what I mean. The CDC is responsible for making recommendations for vaccines along with immunization advisory committees. But decisions on whether any vaccine should be a mandatory requirement for school admittance or matriculation is the responsibility of State and local governments and school districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HPV vaccine is recommended for females age 9 to 26. It protects these young women against the cause of the majority of cervical cancers. While it has been made a requirement for schools in some cities and States around the country, these decisions were made locally, not by the CDC or HHS. Because no Federal funds are used to establish such requirements, we do not object to the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to remind everyone that not too many years ago when America was just getting into the space program, we were very excited about launching the first satellite into space when the Russians launched Sputnik. This was a national disgrace. President Eisenhower had to go on national TV to apologize. He set in place a large number of science and math programs to get us caught up with the Russians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eisenhower programs continued for many years until we decided to write No Child Left Behind, and we killed the Eisenhower funding, which was in the neighborhood of $450 million a year to teach teachers how properly to teach math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its place, we adopted a Math and Science Partnership Program, which operates within the Department of Education. However, the funding, which was authorized at $450 million, which matched the Eisenhower funding of the era before, was never appropriated at a level near that. It has gone up slightly each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this year, even though the appropriations bill increases the No Child Left Behind funding by $8.6 percent, it held the funding for Math Science Partnerships flat, exactly where they were last year. My amendment would increase the Math Science Partnership funding by precisely the same percentage as the entire No Child Left Behind Act was increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offset for this I selected is from the Department of Labor in an area that was funded far above the President's request. I believe this is a reasonable offset. Apparently the CBO agrees. They have scored my amendment as a $10 million savings overall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, here I am, proposing an amendment which will improve our math-science education effort in this Nation. I think it will be very advantageous for our teachers and our schools. Furthermore, the offset is appropriate, and the entire amendment saves the Federal Government $10 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge the adoption of this amendment. I believe it is reasonable and appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also thank him for presenting this amendment, similar to an amendment that I offered earlier in a larger dollar amount. Perhaps this one will have a better chance of success. It still should provide funding for hundreds of teachers in each State, to get some of the professional development that we have promised them that they need and that will help our competitiveness, our quality of life, our economic productivity and the science  capacity of our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we are not doing nearly enough in this area, and everyone says so. We should look for every opportunity to enhance our science and math education, and start by helping the teachers whom we ask to teach these subjects to our students.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his comments. Let me reinforce. This is a major area of concern. We are losing ground compared to other countries. Numerous international tests have displayed that our students are not doing nearly as well. That explains in part why we are losing business, research funding and manufacturing to other countries which are simply outpacing us in their educational effort.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am of a split mind on this amendment, just as I was on the previous Holt amendment this evening. I think the goal of the amendment is certainly worthwhile; but at the same time I am trying to follow a responsible course with respect to the ability of executive agencies to function administratively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again I would simply say that I think the fact that this amendment is being offered in a way that would draw further funds out of the Department of Labor management accounts is another demonstration that the White House is dead wrong when they say that this bill contains too much money. Virtually every amendment that has been offered tonight on both sides of the aisle has been an amendment, with four exceptions, that relate to the President's budget, they have all been efforts to increase  funds. I think that demonstrates that we are substantially short of where we really need to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to mount the barricades to oppose the amendment, but I simply have to observe that while the amendment is certainly worthwhile, the offset that it proposes is really not a real one, and I think we all know when we go to conference we are going to have to repair the administrative budget of the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I am not going to ask people to vote against it if they want to engage in those kinds of actions on the executive branch's administrative functions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I certainly appreciate the chairman's dilemma. I have it also. But I would like to take just a moment to congratulate VERN EHLERS and RUSH HOLT for their leadership. When you come here, there are certain things that are important to you, and when you have an opportunity to effect them, you should. They are consistently supportive of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a national crisis that we have. They are only trying to prepare our kids for the future. And as I understand it, we have already cut the Labor Department by about $4 million. This would be another 15, so approximately an 8 percent reduction in their overall $400 million budget. A slight increase in this, I think, is worth a slight decrease on that side, so I will support the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York for his comments, and I appreciate his support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also appreciate the dilemma of the gentleman from Wisconsin because I previously served on an appropriations committee at the State level and had to fight exactly the same battles and make exactly the same decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just remind everyone here that No Child Left Behind was increased by 8.6 percent. Math and Science Partnership for some reason was left out of that and stayed flat. I am simply asking that it be increased the same amount as No Child Left Behind. I am quite willing to trust the judgment of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and others in conference to make appropriate adjustments to the Labor Department or wherever else adjustments are needed, but I would certainly appreciate  bringing the Math and Science Partnership funding up to exactly the same level that No Child Left Behind has been increased because it is part and parcel of No Child Left Behind.</paragraph>

  <chair> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</chair>
  <chair> Sec. __X. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be used by the Commissioner of Social Security or the Social Security Administration to pay the compensation of employees of the Social Security Administration to administer Social Security benefit payments, under any agreement between the United States and Mexico establishing totalization arrangements between the social security system established by title II of the Social Security Act and the social security system of Mexico, which would not  otherwise be payable but for such agreement.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, on June 29, 2004, the United States Commission of Social Security signed a totalization agreement with the director general of Mexican Social Security Institute to coordinate our Social Security programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Social Security Totalization Agreement with Mexico gives those who have broken our laws the ability to claim Social Security benefits. While current U.S. law prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving Social Security benefits, until 2004 the law did permit illegal aliens to claim credit for work in the United States. If these individuals have amassed over 40 quarters of work, whether their status was legal or illegal, they would be eligible for full benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Considering the ongoing debate over reform and solvency of our Social Security system, it is important to first remove financial incentives to individuals who undermine our immigration laws and then claim benefits, further jeopardizing our U.S. citizens' safety net. The Social Security Administration estimates that this totalization agreement with Mexico would result in 50,000 additional Mexicans qualifying for Social Security benefits in the first 5 years alone. This will only added to the problem  of Social Security insolvency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without necessary reform, our Social Security system is set to go broke by 2042. Nobody disputes that date. However, Mexicans qualifying for Social Security benefits would cost the system $650 million a year by 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A totalization agreement between the United States and Mexico is good only for Mexico. The Mexican Government requires a citizen, including a United States citizen, to pay into their system 24 years as opposed to 10 in the United States. And because of this disparity, the Social Security Administration estimates that only 3,000 American workers would be able to claim benefits in Mexico compared to the 50,000 Mexicans claiming benefits in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States-Mexico Totalization Agreement, Madam Chairman, is bad policy for an already distressed Social Security system and I believe an irresponsible way to spend the money of the American taxpayer. On top of everything else, the totalization agreement can go into effect without congressional approval because it would automatically become law within 60 days of being filed by the White House if Congress does not act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this in mind, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, the Gingrey amendment, specifically address this problem with Mexico, and remove the incentive for the Social Security Administration to fulfill the United States-Mexico Social Security Totalization Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am opposed to the amendment, yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to say to my friend, Mr. Gingrey, and I think he knows, that there was an amendment accepted in committee that addressed any concern that anyone might have with regard to any type of totalization agreement that this country might sign with a partner, friend, or ally which would require that any totalization agreement conform with existing American law and that no law, including immigration law, could be violated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I think the gentleman is aware or should be aware that there is no way under existing law that anyone who does not have authorization to work in this country, including undocumented immigrants, qualify for receipt of Social Security benefits. Therefore, I would say to the gentleman that his amendment is not only unnecessary, not only overly prescriptive and not only harmful to American workers who are called to service in other countries, including Mexico, and as a result of their service,  whether privately or publicly in these other countries, they are paying into a Social Security system which they may never have a chance to benefit from. And when they come home to the U.S., they may never qualify with enough credits, 40 quarters, to qualify for American Social Security benefits. We would harm those American workers here in this country under this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But beyond all that, I think what the gentleman tried to explains with regard to his concerns relating to undocumented immigration are totally off base because existing law would not allow anyone who works in this country without authorization to collect those Social Security benefits which he seeks to protect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say that of our 10 largest trading partners, we already have totalization agreements with seven of them. Two of those trading partners don't qualify for totalization agreements, Taiwan and China, because they don't have comparable Social Security systems to ours; and, therefore, we would not have a way to have a compatible system to exchange those benefits among our workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only one of those top trading partners with whom we have not yet finalized a totalization agreement is Mexico. We happen to have totalization agreements with 21 of our allies, partners, and close friends and neighbors, including countries like Korea, Chile, Ireland, Japan, Italy, Spain, and Canada. A totalization agreement with any country, including Mexico, must go through this Congress before it could ever be approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would have to go through a public hearing that would be held by the committee of jurisdiction, and each body in this Congress would have an opportunity to vote for disapproval in which case the totalization agreement signed by any administration would not go into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we must remember that there are millions of American workers who have worked abroad who are impacted by not having a totalization agreement. The estimates are that American workers would benefit to the tune of $140 million, and that is on a yearly basis, if we had a totalization agreement with Mexico because of the large number of Americans who go and work in Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much would it cost us to finalize this agreement? The estimates are it would cost us about $105 million, less than we would collect for our American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for comparison purposes, I should mention that the totalization agreement we have with Canada cost us $197 million in the year 2002 alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a good deal for American workers because many of them have given a lot of their service, good service, to this country and other places outside of the U.S. They should have an opportunity to benefit from our Social Security system. They should not be deprived of that opportunity simply because they didn't fulfill those 40 quarters all in the U.S. That is what totalization agreements are about. They have to benefit our country, otherwise they wouldn't be reached. For anyone to say otherwise  is to mask an argument, perhaps the issue of immigration, at the expense of American workers who are trying to get their pension and future retirement benefits under Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would hope that the Members here in the House would recognize that we won't reach any totalization agreement with any country unless it is in our interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it shouldn't be just one country that is singled out if a totalization agreement is bad. It should be with any country that it doesn't benefit us to have this agreement with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would just say to my friend, the gentleman from California, the totalization agreements we have with other countries, I think there are some 20 other countries, and this totalization agreement with Mexico would cost more than all of those 20 agreements combined at the 50,000 estimate that I gave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, the Social Security Administration estimates the 50,000 number is a significant underestimate. So I feel very strongly that at a time when our Social Security system is in such a dire crisis, needs significant reform, for us to have a totalization agreement with Mexico that in  fact of course has already been negotiated and signed for all of those workers prior to 2004; and, no, it doesn't apply to any after 2004, but this is a significant  cost that we cannot afford. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for his courtesy in yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In lieu of offering an amendment this evening, I appreciate the opportunity to briefly share with Members a concern regarding the education title of this bill. I have learned that taxpayer dollars in this bill, combined with taxpayer dollars at the State and local level, are used to purchase textbooks printed and manufactured in countries that censor these teaching materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, one of the consequences of outsourcing to cheaper labor sources overseas is that an increasingly large number of American textbooks and educational materials are printed overseas, especially in China, a country which the State Department's 2006 Country Report on Human Rights concludes actively censors all publications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Department's Human Rights report reads, "By law, only government-approved publishing houses are permitted to print books. The State Press and Publications Administration controls all licenses to publish. The Chinese Communist Party exerts control over the publishing industry by preemptively classifying certain topics as off limits."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, "the government does not respect academic freedom and increases controls on political and social discourses at colleges, universities, and research institutes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the Chinese Government is forcing the same censorship on American students and teachers, and let me just explain how this happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An American publishing company develops a textbook or any educational material and decides to print it overseas because they can save on printing costs by doing so. But the material content will be censored by the government-sanctioned publishing houses to conform to Chinese requirements. The Dalai Lama, Tiananmen Square, and balanced discussions of Tibet, political freedoms and descriptions of democratic participation and public protest will intentionally be left on the cutting room floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then a well-meaning, well-prepared unsuspecting teacher or school district buys this textbook for their classroom, a textbook which contains no mention of the Dalai Lama and a decidedly altered discussion of politics and culture, even American politics and culture because Chinese censorship laws do not discriminate between Chinese and American texts and contexts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And ultimately public funds meant to educate our children are simultaneously suppressing human rights and freedoms, and limiting exposure and curriculums on important topics of history, politics and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same situation exists, with far more harmful consequences, for teacher manuals because if a lesson does not exist in the teacher's curriculum, chances are that the students won't be taught that lesson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the lesson that our students truly need to learn, and which must not be censored, is that State-sponsored censorship should not be supported with public dollars. I hope that my colleagues will join me in future efforts to teach our schoolchildren that ethics and morals and their education are more important, and more valuable, than cheap labor and production costs.</paragraph>

  <chair> Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the National Labor Relations Board to recognize as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees any labor organization that has not been certified as such by the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159).</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400385" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple amendment, one that we have debated the basic principle in the Education and Labor Committee. This is a funding limitation amendment that would say, under the National Labor Relations Act, the board can only recognize a union if there has been a private ballot vote. The current law basically says this, although they have an option for card check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would say that they cannot expend funds to recognize a union that has not been certified through a secret ballot election. It would basically say the board cannot recognize a card checked union as bargaining agent for employees, with the practical effect of requiring that a union be chosen by secret ballot election if it wishes to actually avail itself of any protections under the act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the right to have a private vote is very important. I believe that it's very easy to do a shakedown in committee but not on the floor during the debates. We had various amendments regarding penalties. We had various amendments, whether illegals could go on the card check, how intimidation could occur on illegals who signed the card check, from both sides, from management and labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the only way to have a fair election that we know that people  want to form a union is to have a private ballot, and that's the intent of this amendment, to restrict the enforcement of anything not allowing a private ballot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to speak against the amendment and claim the time in opposition.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this amendment, what this amendment says is that the National Labor Relations Board could not enforce the party's obligation to bargain in good faith following a voluntary recognition. So an employer and an employee can get together, they can voluntarily enter into an agreement by which they have their working relationship, and if they're down the road at some point, one of them wants to bring an action, the employer against the employees or the employees against the employer for not bargaining  in good faith, the National Labor Relations Board couldn't enforce that, couldn't take any action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a voluntary agreement. It doesn't even have to be through the card check process. Any voluntary agreement, you're suggesting that somehow these people would not be able to enforce that agreement once it was entered into.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This undermines the rights of potentially millions of American workers that have already organized under voluntary recognition agreements and already engaged in a collective bargaining relationship. These workers may have decades long collective bargaining arrangements already that they have worked under, and then if the most recent contract expires, they would have no enforceable right to go back and enforce their rights under the Souder amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This makes no sense. It's rather incredible to me that under the Souder amendment what we would be doing is inserting the government in a private voluntary agreement between an employer and an employer. I understand the gentleman doesn't like card check, but that's not what this is about. This is about any voluntary agreement that they've entered into, and I don't know why we would be inserting the government at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at this point, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment seeks in 7 minutes to undue 72 years of labor law. For 72 years, it's been the law of the land that if an employer and an employee organization voluntarily choose to engage in collective bargaining, they're permitted to do so. This is a process that has led to labor harmony, economic prosperity and growth for the economy. Why we would even consider prohibiting that kind of arrangement from going forward is beyond me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge the defeat of the amendment on grounds that it rather recklessly undoes a 72-year process that's worked quite well for both labor and management.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 13 years, I cut men's suits at Seaford Clothing Factory in Rock Island, Illinois. I wouldn't be here as a Member of Congress if it were not for my union. My membership in UNITE HERE Local 617 afforded me access to higher wages, good benefits, and invaluable workplace safety protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Souder amendment, the NLRB could not enforce either party's obligation to bargain in good faith following a voluntary recognition. This would undermine the rights of potentially millions of workers who have already organized under voluntary recognition agreements and already engaged in collective bargaining relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Majority Sign-Up has been available under the National Labor Relations Act since 1935. It's proven to reduce strife in the workplace, resulting in better labor-management relations. Majority sign-ups also reduce coercion and pressure, compared to NLRB elections, which is why I'm a strong proponent of the Employee Free Choice Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague mentioned, the Souder amendment would force all workers into the broken, unfair, undemocratic election system and strip away the freedom of contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all of my colleagues to vote against the Souder amendment which would take a huge step backwards for the rights of American workers, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me just reiterate again, and my two colleagues have said this. Under existing law today, if the employer doesn't like the agreement, the voluntary agreement, or if employees come to them and say, gee, we all want to join a union, here's a majority, whatever it is, the employer says, no, game is over, it's off, it's done. He has a veto, absolute veto, it's over. So the only way you can have this voluntary agreement is if the employer is happy  with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, now we have an agreement where the employer's happy, the employees are happy, and they work under it for a number of years, but you cannot ever go and seek enforcement. So apparently what the gentleman is doing, he's just decided he's going to insert the government for only one purpose, and that's the purpose to destroy basic worker rights and the ability to organize the workplace, even if they do it voluntarily and with the consent of the employer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know the gentleman's always believed in limited government, and I know the gentleman doesn't think the government should interfere in all these contractual arrangements. Here's a voluntary arrangement and you're going to insert the government for one purpose, to deny the employees their rights under the voluntary agreement which they entered into with an employer who had the veto if he didn't want to enter into it. They can't coerce him into doing it. He has the veto. We should reject  this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me read the amendment. "None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the National Labor Relations Board to recognize as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees any labor organization that has not been certified as such by the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basically, to have this be ruled in order, I would have liked to have made it more precisely targeted towards just the card check. In effect what this says is that in order to be recognized as an exclusive bargaining representative, you have to have a free election. That is my intent. That is the intent of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why do I feel that we need to do this bill at this time? One is we have a separate bill moving through that would in effect deprive workers of America of the right to a private ballot. But secondly, earlier today or yesterday I should say, with my support, unlike many of my Republican colleagues, I believe in the right to association. I supported the police and firemen's right to organize, and it came under suspension, and I voted for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is another card check potential where police and fire would be put in a position where in some cases in towns in my district that oppose this bill, there are five people. With a card check, those people are going to be subject to everybody in town watching who they are, and there's no guarantee if three are pressured into signing that there will be a private ballot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, and I understand that there are flaws with this amendment and hopefully we could work this out, but this amendment is basically a card check amendment given the fact that not only do we have one bill moving through, but we also had a bill move through last night on suspension that would in effect potentially have police and firemen unionize across the United States in areas where they previously hadn't been and a bill that I supported and believe in the right to association but  I also believe there should be a private ballot associated with that right to association.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would simply like to read a portion of the letter from Greg Tarpinion from Change to Win. He simply says this: "Since its inception in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act has permitted workers to unionize and their union representatives to be recognized by obtaining signatures in support from a majority of workers to be represented."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many large companies such as Cingular Wireless, Kaiser Permanente, and Harley-Davidson from my own State have voluntarily recognized their employees' desire for union representation using this type of majority signup procedure. By eliminating any funds for the National Labor Relations Board to enforce the laws, in cases in which the majority signup is used, the Souder amendment would gut this long-standing avenue for worker recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, any unions already recognized and any contracts already bargained with unions that obtained recognition using this method would be thrown into legal limbo, and any otherwise applicable labor law protections would become unenforceable. That, to me, doesn't seem to make very much sense.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today I offer an amendment cosponsored by Congressman TOM COLE, Congressman BOBBY SCOTT, and Congresswoman CAROL SHEA-PORTER that will prohibit funds from being used to carry out a damaging, unethical Education Department proposed evaluation of a TRIO program, the Upward Bound program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will put a halt to this unethical study that deceives students and their families, takes away critical opportunities for them, and sets the program up for failure. This same language is included in the higher education reconciliation bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Members from both sides of the aisle for rebuffing the Education Department's repeated, relentless efforts to kill the TRIO Upward Bound program over the past 2 years. Because of the adamant congressional resistance, the Department has now decided that they can simply study the program to death. This is an unethical program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I submit for the Record three letters from highly respected institutional review boards that indicate that this is an unethical program and also a letter from 15 highly respected educational associations deeming the study unethical. The FDA regulates these institutional review boards, and it's precisely to protect human beings who are subject to human experimentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MEMORANDUM &lt;br&gt;To: Dr. Beverly Simone, President, Southeastern Community College</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following evaluation and consideration of the U.S. Department of Education's project, "Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound's Increased Emphasis on Higher-Risk Students," Southeastern Community College's Institutional Review Board would like to express its concerns with this research and our involvement with the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we expect that our College's Upward Bound program staff will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education and the evaluation project, our initial concern is that potential participation in Upward Bound (UB) requires students to participate in the evaluation study. For those students and families who do not want to participate in the study, they can complete forms indicating that decision. Yet, they are still entered into a lottery in which they may not be chosen for UB. The  design of the study (with UB very likely serving fewer students due to half of the students being assigned to the control, group) inherently denies services to students that they otherwise would likely receive without the study being conducted. In essence, we question the validity and ethical foundation of a study which induces a negative impact on the program being studied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Closely related to the fact that this study is not ultimately voluntary is the fact that the control group will only receive token monetary compensation as opposed to the benefits of Upward Bound (UB) despite having participated in the study to the same degree as the experimental group. In essence, by participating in the study some students will not have the opportunity to participate in UB. The project's research design is similar to other experimental-control group designs in which one group  is denied a treatment in order to determine the treatment's effect. Typically in such research if the treatment is effective, the control group is immediately given the treatment as an ethical consideration for their being placed randomly in the control group. In the current project, the treatment is the Upward Bound program itself. Students in the control group will not be able to participate in UB due to age considerations after the study, and as the study stands, there is no plan to provide any educational program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our last concern relates to the language level used in the materials that parents of participating UB students must complete. We presume that many of those parents read at levels below high school. Requiring completion of these materials may discourage participation in the program, a  most unfortunate result for the prospective UB participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The IRB appreciates the purpose of Upward Bound and understands the institutional decision to participate in the study, but we want you to know our concerns with respect to this research. As always, we appreciate your consideration of our position and your support of ensuring the integrity of research at Southeastern Community College.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR MS. FELKER: I am the Associate Vice President for Research Integrity at the University of Utah. The University of Utah Institutional Review Board (IRB) provided me with information regarding the U.S. Department of Education's plan to evaluate the Upward Bound program. My understanding is that the study has been deemed exempt from local IRB review. Normally our IRB would make that determination and would not defer that responsibility to external agencies. Nevertheless, the study would  appear to be exempt under Category 5 of the federal regulations 45 CFR 46. While the IRB will not exert oversight authority for this research, IRB staff have raised a number of concerns about the conduct of this study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After reviewing this information, I also will express my concerns over the study design. Recruitment of twice as many eligible students than can be served and randomly assigning applicants to intervention and control groups raises serious ethical issues. Assuming this well-established program has shown some evidence of benefit in past assessments, assignment to the control group would deny those benefits, but only after an extensive application process and the development of a relationship with  program staff. Then to deny even the possibility of obtaining services from the Upward Bound program in the future may compound the harm and preclude services for which they would otherwise be eligible. Surely there is a better way to conduct an assessment of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DOE will continue to collect data on the educational outcomes of the children in the control group, although they will not be receiving any services from the program. Further, the consent forms do not indicate an ability to withdraw from the study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies with non-intervention control arms always receive close scrutiny by the IRB because of their ethical complexities. It is incumbent on the investigators to demonstrate that this study design minimizes risks of harm and that other research designs are not feasible. Of course, I was not involved in the discussion over this research design, but it seems highly probable that other approaches could be used to assess the value of the Upward Bound program. I strongly encourage a reassessment  of the conduct of this research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By way of credentials, I will note that I currently serve of the DHHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) and so have extensive experience with research ethics and federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please relay our concerns to the DOE and other federal officials who are involved in governing this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Best regards,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeffrey R. Botkin, M.D., M.P.H.,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor of Pediatrics and Biomedical Ethics, Associate Vice President for Research Integrity. &lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 18, 2006. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. MANNING: I write on behalf of the higher education associations listed below to comment on the Notice of Proposed Priority for the Upward Bound program published in the July 3, 2006 Federal Register. My colleagues and I have both substantive and procedural problems with the proposed priority to narrow Upward Bound services to 9th grade students meeting criteria selected by the Department. We especially object to the fact that this process effectively exchanges a congressional  priority for an administrative one--a practice we view as precedent-setting and disturbing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several aspects of this proposal concern us, among them:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The priority asserted is such a marked departure from existing program design that it effectively substitutes a new program for the one that Congress authorized and provided the funds to operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed priority discards the current flexibility to vary the program in accordance with local needs, substituting in its place a monolithic federal vision about whom to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By establishing a priority for a cohort of 9th grade students, the proposal would disenfranchise all of the 10th and 11th graders that Congress intended to be served by the Upward Bound services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The requirement that 30% of newly-admitted students be "at high academic risk for failure" would deprive certain 9th grade students--those who may do well in school--from receiving the Upward Bound services they may require.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, the proposal creates a troubling gray area between congressional intent as expressed in statutory language--sometimes amplified by report language--and the Department's Constitutional obligation to carry out that intent in a straightforward manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate that the Department is engaged with the problem of reducing the unacceptably high numbers of high school students who drop out prior to graduation. This is an important problem that deserves attention. However, if this priority setting approach is adopted, it is easy to imagine that many other programs administered by the Department will be subject to a wholesale redesign outside the normal legislative and regulatory processes. We strongly urge you to discard this proposed priority  setting effort in favor of working with the Congress and the higher education community to develop promising approaches to solving this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President, </paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of: American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, American Association of Community Colleges, American Association of State Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education, American Indian Higher Education Consortium, Association of American Universities, Association of Community College Trustees, Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Council for Opportunity in Education, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association  for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, National Association independent Colleges and Universities, National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in the interest of time, I will be brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Moore amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, which would defund the evaluation component of the Department of Education's absolute priority, is crafted to spare our teachers from choosing between two values that should never be in conflict, following their Nation's laws and tending to their students' well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Oklahoma educators well, and I can tell you that Oklahoma educators are honorable people. If there is a law on the books, they will follow that law to its letter and spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I believe that this particular law, that is the Department of Education's absolute priorities, is inconsistent with our teachers' obligation to do what's best for our students. The absolute priority evaluation component would have Upward Bound students recruit twice as many students as they are able to serve. Half of those students would then be directed away from TRIO, becoming a control group to prove or disprove TRIO's effectiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, we would raise these children's hope and then use them as guinea pigs to test our own theories and ideas. That's dishonest, it's cynical and it's wrong. I have no question in my mind about the outcome of such an experiment. TRIO would prove to be what it is, one of the most successful ways to encourage and support disadvantaged first-generation college students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet even in the best-case scenario, where TRIO has proven successful, Upward Bound programs across the country would be left with a group of students that would never be able to use their services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose changing Upward Bound in order to recruit students into the program that could not receive help, giving on the one hand, and taking away with the other. We should aim to put our students and teachers in a position for success, and I believe that we will do so with the passage of the Moore amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of my amendment that would preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to the Medicare Advantage program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is simple. It would prohibit the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing any policy that would prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from enrolling in Medicare Advantage, which allows seniors the option of receiving their Medicare benefits through a private health care plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 8.3 million Medicare beneficiaries, including millions of low-income minority and rural seniors, are receiving their health benefits through Medicare Advantage. Retired union workers are also attracted to this important program. In fact, in my home State of Michigan, 116,000 retired teachers, janitors, bus drivers and school cafeteria workers are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan to the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vulnerable beneficiaries choose Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare because it's often cheaper and comes with better benefits than traditional Medicare, like disease management programs and preventive care. Low-income seniors are more likely to enroll in Medicare Advantage, relying on the program's lower copayments and free preventive care. Medicare Advantage plans saved beneficiaries an average of $86 per month, compared to what they would have spent in traditional Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Medicare Advantage provides protection against catastrophic health care costs not provided by traditional Medicare. For example, many beneficiaries can choose a Medicare advantage plan that would cap their annual out-of-pocket health care costs at $2,000. Minority beneficiaries are more likely to enroll in Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, 40 percent of African Americans and 53 percent of Hispanics who depend on Medicare for their health care are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP recognizes the importance of Medicare advantage saying: "By providing more comprehensive benefits and lower cost-sharing than traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans help racial and ethnic minority populations gain access to health care services that are critical to their long-term health and well-being."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time, seniors have access to Medicare Advantage, regardless of whether they live in big cities or in rural America, in districts like mine. Rural seniors have voted with their feet. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage has increased 300 percent since 2004 when just half of rural seniors had a Medicare Advantage plan in their area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rural beneficiaries clearly like their new options. Medicare Advantage is helping to provide flexible, affordable, modern health care benefits for minorities, low-income beneficiaries, seniors living in rural areas and union retirees. Congress must ensure that these health care benefits are available to qualifying beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we have not had enough time to analyze the most recent version of this amendment. Its apparent innocuousness, frankly, raises my suspicions. It would appear to enforce current law for eligibility to enroll in benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for this to be offered just at the time that the authorizers are reauthorizing the SCHIP program and considering pay-fors that might include tightening payments to Medicare Advantage providers, it makes me wonder if this is more than a powerful coincidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is certainly not within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. It most certainly is within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. I don't think, given the sensitivity of it, that it ought to be handled in this manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would certainly intend not to support it. My understanding is also that the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are both highly concerned about this amendment. And under these circumstances, I think it would be highly ill-advised for the House to adopt this amendment at this time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400021" topic="ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend from Michigan, as he knows, and we are working through the process in the Ways and Means Committee to try to figure out how we reform Medicare to make it more available to seniors throughout this country, and at the same time Medicare Advantage to find out a way to finally fund at an adequate level to fund the State health insurance program that is funded by the Federal Government, so that we can somehow find a way to cover the 9 million children in this country  who still receive no health insurance coverage, that this amendment seems to do two things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is unnecessary, and that is to say that we will try to make sure that no one is denied access to any coverage under a Medicare Advantage plan. I know of nothing that would deprive any individual who seeks to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan that opportunity to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it seems geared to spook seniors who might not know what's going on if they see language or hear that there is some provision in law through the appropriations process that would say that we can't deprive them of an opportunity to apply for a particular type of Medicare coverage. It might seem to lend some credence to those who are trying to make seniors believe that they are going to be deprived of the Medicare benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There is nothing further from the truth. In fact, every effort that is being made, as the gentleman knows, in the Ways and Means Committee is to actually enhance the benefits that our seniors will receive under Medicare. What we have found is over the years that many Medicare providers are finding it very difficult to stay within the Medicare system because of the lack of reimbursement, or so at least they claim. And in many cases we do find areas of the country that are finding fewer and fewer  providers available to Medicare recipients to be able to access their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to the gentleman that if indeed this amendment is targeted at something in particular, it would be great if we could have that identified. But at this stage, I see nothing in the current law or anything on the horizon emanating from the Congress and certainly from our committee that we both serve on, the Ways and Means Committee, that would in any way jeopardize any individual's opportunity to access Medicare coverage through the Medicare Advantage plans that are available. And for  that reason I would hope that, if nothing else, seniors who might be watching this debate at this time take nothing from this particular amendment to indicate to them that they should have any reason to fear that anyone would try to deprive them of their Medicare benefits.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say that this is really a straightforward amendment. What it simply does is prohibit the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing any policy that would prohibit a beneficiary from enrolling in Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, obviously, if beneficiaries lose access to care by a reduction in funds to the Medicare Advantage program, and thereby benefits being reduced, that is something we want to try to avoid. This is a critically important program that, as I said, ensures millions of seniors that have seen rapid growth, and in particular parts of the country has made really great strides in covering low-income seniors, those in rural and urban areas, those in minority populations that might not otherwise have  access to care, and we have seen enrollment increase 300 percent since 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think in light of what is going on, it is important to reinforce our support for this strategically important program, but it is a fairly simple and straightforward amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is an attempt to do some stuff tonight that will eliminate otherwise doing it tomorrow and perhaps shortening tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment after amendment has come before this body seeking to reduce spending out of this appropriations bills. We took some 16 votes earlier this evening. The harsh truth of the matter is, should any of those votes to reduce spending have been successful, the reality is that money would not have been saved. The deficit for 2008 would still be exactly the same as it was under this bill that was presented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What my amendment would do is to create a sense of Congress that should we be successful in reducing spending coming up out of these appropriations bills, that that money would in fact reduce the deficit; and, hopefully, in the near future when we are in a surplus circumstance, that would increase the  surplus as opposed to simply being recycled back through the Appropriations Committee to spend in perhaps some other area, but nevertheless spend that  money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand there is a point of order that lies against this, and I will not insist on a ruling from the Chair. But I did want to highlight again on this bill tonight that, should any of my colleagues be successful in getting a vote to reduce spending, that reduction in spending does not actually happen; the money stays in 302(b) allocations and is spent somewhere else. So all of the conversations we have in here on the pros and cons about those issues is really wasted rhetoric under our current  set of rules.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, again in an attempt to get a little work done tonight that we would otherwise have to put off until tomorrow, I am offering up an amendment that would say straightforwardly that we will not spend money. None of the funds made available under this act for Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program would be spent as long as we keep restrictions into place on drilling in ANWR and our intercontinental shelves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems illogical to me to drive the costs of home heating oil and natural gas up by restricting domestic production of those two commodities and, at the same time, try to fill an insatiable demand for LIHEAP funding. We added $400 million in LIHEAP money to the continuing resolution for 2007. This adds another $880 million in LIHEAP spending, again, an insatiable demand for these funds. And, at the same time, we are driving up the cost of that commodity so that the funds that we actually do  plow back into LIHEAP don't go as far in terms of buying and giving relief to those folks who qualify for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while I am not so much opposed to LIHEAP, I am opposed to the illogical public policy of limiting domestic production of crude oil and natural gas through artificial restraints on drilling in those places of the United States where we have our own production and thereby increasing the cost to consumers in States that take advantage of these LIHEAP funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I understand a point of order lies against this. I do not intend to push that to a ruling of the Chair, but I did want to bring to the attention of my colleagues what I believe is the illogical position to take to restrict domestic production of crude oil and natural gas and, at the same time, try to fund as I see it is an insatiable demand for LIHEAP funding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Let me thank the Chair and also thank the Chair of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee, and let me just for a moment thank them overall for this bill and mention the $3.3 billion in increased student aid; the $1.3 billion for Health Resources and Services Administration, the primary agency dealing with health care access; the $1 billion for medical research, which includes more research for cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; $880  million for low-income home energy; $949 million for employment and training services; and $660 million for the community services block grant. I wanted to acknowledge the direction of this bill and my support for it. But let me also acknowledge that there is more work to be done in the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I read from the report language, it indicates that this office is responsible for enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age in all programs and institutions that receive funds from the Department. These laws extend to the 50 State educational agencies and 16,000 local educational agencies as well, 3,500 institutions of higher learning. And that is my concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment reduces the amount of money in the area of the administration aspect of the Department of Education, which includes the Office of Civil Rights, to focus on glaring problems that exist in that program. For example, if you look at fiscal year 2005, only 18 percent of the cases that this agency dealt with was in regard to race and national origin. As relates to minorities in special education, 10 cases were initiated, 19 were resolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, the Clinton administration settled a number of OCR cases, Office of Civil Rights cases, segregation cases with Historically Black Colleges. Those cases included schools in Virginia, schools in Texas, schools in Georgia, and a number of others. These particular settlements required compliance, and that means that the Office of Civil Rights was responsible for enforcing the compliance of these agreements by the States that these schools were located in. Sadly, we have found that several  schools have suffered from the lack of enforcement of the Department of Education: Texas Southern University in Texas, Morgan State in Maryland, and Florida A&amp;M in Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the enforcement of the Office of Civil Rights, the States don't comply with requirements to end discrimination on these historically black colleges. My amendment reinforces the importance of the Office of Civil Rights continuing to enforce strongly the agreements that were made pursuant to segregation or desegregation settlements at the beginning of 2000. I would hope that recognizing the value of education, the value of the 104 Historically Black Colleges, that the Office of Civil Rights  would step up their enforcement on the issues dealing with race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me indicate that this is not a question of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. I do not want to diminish enforcement on issues of disability, age discrimination, on sex discrimination, but I do want to see the increase of enforcement on issues dealing with race where it is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in my own State, the Governor of the State was willing to put our Historically Black College in conservatorship even though he recognized that that would eliminate the accreditation of that school. That required an enforcement by the Department of Education and the Office of Civil Rights. They were completely missing in their enforcement responsibilities in that instance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, it is a simple amendment that reinforces the importance of enforcement in the Office of  Civil Rights, broad based and needed, and I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to <bill type="h" number="3043">H.R. 3043</bill>, Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008, and to commend Mr. Obey for his leadership in shepherding this bill through the legislative process. Among other agencies, this legislation funds the Office of Civil Rights, which ensures equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the Nation through vigorous enforcement  of civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important message from the Congress of the United States. My amendment emphasizes the decrease in funding by $2,000,000 and an increase in funding by $2,000,000 to better assist the Office in their support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically Black Colleges and Universities, frequently known as HBCUs are institutions of higher learning that were established before 1964 with the intention of serving the African American community. Oftentimes people talk about HBCUs as if they were all the same, but nothing could be further from the truth. There are more than 100 HBCUs in the United States, and they come in all types and sizes. HBCUs can be public or private, and come in both the two-year and 4-year variety. Some are large,  and some are small. HBCUs are located in 20 States, Washington, DC, the Virgin Islands, and in my great city, Houston, TX.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, one of Texas's great treasures, Texas Southern University (TSU), and like many other HBCUs need our assistance in continuing their legacies in providing superior educational opportunities to deserving young men and women. That mission cannot be accomplished if Congress does not take the appropriate action of validating my amendment into this bill. I am strongly opposed to any action or non-action that would prevent or restrict opportunities to people to gain knowledge away from  these educational institutions. HBCUs pride themselves on educating American minorities, especially since there was a time in our Nation's history when people of minority status were withheld from their humane right to education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, you may not be aware that there is a serious stigma associated with HBCUs in this Nation. Many stereotypes convey that HBCUs don't prepare students for the real world, or HBCUs have too many financial problems, and even non-HBCUs offer better quality of education. Many States are considering appointing a Conservator, an individual similar to a trustee in a bankruptcy case; the Conservator's duty would be to oversee the governance of the HBCUs in each particular State. This move  would be unprecedented, never in the history of this Nation has an HBCU been placed on Conservatorship. This move is essentially a death</paragraph>
    <paragraph>sentence for all HBCUs. It would further validate the stereotypical stigmas attached to HBCUs around this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I can tell you first hand that my very own state, Texas, is considering a Conservatorship program for its HBCU, Texas Southern University. This action does not befit the distinguished history of TSU, which includes notable alumni such as two former Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Barbara Jordan and George "Mickey" Leland, and will exacerbate rather than overcome the challenges facing TSU by demoralizing the faculty, alumni, and student body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam, Chairman, Congress must act to bring restoration back to the HBCU community. Right now as it stands, HBCUs are underfunded and are resource deprived. Many students are unable to access the proper books, supplies and current technology needed to obtain a quality education comparable to predominately white, wealthier institutions. The lack of educational resources will disproportionately affect the type of education students receive attending HBCUs. As a direct result many HBCUs' graduates  are unable to compete effectively with the non-HBCU graduates in the workplace; contributing to the ever present socio-economic disaster in America today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the HBCUs living arrangements for their students lack in comparison to predominately white institutions. HBCUs' dormitories have several maintenance problems, insect infestations, and minimum house upkeep. This type of atmosphere is hardly conducive to the learning environment that students need to excel in their school work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all these reasons, Madam Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment and thank Mr. Obey for his courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together this excellent legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAFEO Appeals to Governor Perry</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WASHINGTON, DC.--NAFEO urges Governor Perry to reconsider his decision to eliminate the Texas Southern University, TSU, Board and appoint a conservator for the University. NAFEO President Lezli Baskerville said, "Eliminating the Board would most assuredly impact TSU's accreditation. The SACS Principles of Accreditation require that its accreted institutions have a board of directors. The elimination of the Board could result in public sanction or loss of accreditation. The appointing  of a conservator would make matters worse. It would cast a pall on and further destabilize the University." "It would also bode ill for the University's accreditation and deter enrollment and fund development--both of which have been on the rise in recent years. It would have a negative impact on the morale of faculty, administrators, staff, students and alumni. Some may flee," she said. "Surely this is not what Governor Perry intends," Baskerville added.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the trade association for the presidents and chancellors of all of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs, and predominantly black institutions, NAFEO is uniquely situated to assist TSU through this challenging situation and to return it to its position of preeminence in the higher education community. NAFEO's membership of sitting HBCU and PBI presidents, and its network of former presidents and chancellors, academic vice presidents, business and finance officers,  accreditation experts are willing, able and available to work with the Governor, legislators, the state higher education executive officer, TSU's Interim President J. Timothy Boddie, Jr., and others to put in place the structure, systems and personnel necessary to strengthen the institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Baskerville said, "We are particularly concerned that Governor Perry's decision to appoint a conservator mimics a very disconcerting pattern. We have seen it in Florida, where last month the Florida Board of Governors established `The Task Force on FAMU Financial and Operational Control Issues' and the state university system chancellor said the worst case scenario `would be a decision not to fund [FAMU]. And without funding, the university would cease to exist.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The trend toward states' expanding academic programs and establishing facility citadels at flagship and other historically white institutions while disinvesting in HBCUs is a problem we must quickly address. One of the challenges for TSU and other HBCUs is that at no time have they been provided public funding that would enable them to be comparable and competitive to their white counterparts. Today, when economic and social freedom are increasingly linked to a postsecondary education, and  when the data demonstrate that HBCUs and PBIs are the most cost efficient and in many regards the most effective institutions at preparing disproportionate percentages of traditionally underserved students--the growing populations of the State of Texas and the Nation--states are continuing to invest disproportionately fewer dollars in public HBCUs than in their white counterparts. To be sure, this does not absolve HBCUs from being exemplary stewards of whatever resources they have. It does suggest that while it is critical to examine management issues and to address deficits we must simultaneously examine state policies, practices, appropriations</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as I indicated, I support this underlying bill and thank the chairman and ranking member for the work that they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us are concerned as we move forward with educating our children, particularly in the primary and secondary school. As I work with teachers and students and families regarding public school education, one of the great concerns has been the fallout of the Leave No Child Behind. I realize that going forward we will be looking at a reform of that legislation, but I thought it was important in the reduction and increase in funding in areas dealing with disadvantaged children, disadvantaged  education opportunities to emphasize the importance of providing teaching, teaching and student relationships, over testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me cite for you the dropout rates in the Hispanic and African American communities' percent of all dropouts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Black and non-Hispanic, 27.2 percent, and the population is only 14 percent. Hispanic, 20.8 percent dropout, and the population is 15.8 percent. Much of that dropout came as a result of standardized testing when the students did not pass and, therefore, did not return back to high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is simple. What it offers is an emphasis on teaching children, disadvantaged children, teaching more than testing, relating to the teacher-student relationship and providing teacher-based tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I offer just a brief comment that indicates Texas Parents, Teachers Unhappy with Standardized Testing. What we need is a comprehensive approach to stop the high dropout rate, as this particular legislation has had. But, more importantly, to evaluate the idea of testing as opposed to teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment to emphasize the importance of thwarting the high dropout rate among Hispanics and African Americans and to emphasize the importance of teaching disadvantaged children so that they remain in school and to develop tests by teachers that will be more related to the subject that the student is learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first thank my distinguished colleague Chairman OBEY for his extraordinary leadership and guidance in crafting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3043">H.R. 3043</bill> will play a crucial role in addressing and perhaps providing a cure for the many educational ills among this nation's poorest and most disadvantaged children. I fully support the spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) but I question its effectiveness in leaving no child behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, leaving no child left behind starts with ensuring that all students have adequate resources to meet their particular circumstances. That is why I offer my amendment which provides: The amount otherwise provided in this Act for "Department of Education--Title I for the Education of the Disadvantaged for "carrying out title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ("ESEA") (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.)" is hereby decreased by $2,000,000 and increased by $2,000,000.  The purpose of my amendment, which decreases and then increases the funding in Title I for the Education of the Disadvantaged, is to address the special problems and challenges to disadvantaged communities and children posed by the No Child Left Behind Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, NCLB established goals everyone supports: high standards and accountability for the learning of all children. But NCLB is falling short of its goals for many reasons. Let's examine the purpose of NCLB which includes the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To improve teacher and principal quality through research supported innovation in teacher and principal preparation programs;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To increase the number of highly qualified teachers in the classroom and highly qualified principals and assistant principals in schools; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To foster an environment of collaboration among Pre-kindergarten through 12 school districts and universities and their units that prepare teachers and school administrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, regardless of the purpose of the bill, the reality is that a rigid one-size-fits-all approach to accountability does not work. Improving student learning is of vital importance, and we must be fully committed to creating great public schools with high academic standards for all students. Every child should be learning and succeeding in school, but the record reflects that many minority and disadvantaged students are struggling, and the reasons are as diverse and complex as the  students themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, all across this great nation the high school dropout rates of disadvantaged and underserved students are steadily increasing. Moreover, many school administrators are under-representing the number of high school dropouts. In my home state of Texas nearly it has been reported that 119,400 students fail to graduate with their peers each year. African-Americans and Hispanics suffer disproportionately. The rate of graduation for African-American students is 62 percent and 58 percent  for Hispanics; while the rates of graduation for Asian and White students are 87 percent and 76 percent, respectively. This dismal reality not only cost individual students the opportunity to reach their goals, but also cost individual states and the entire country in a number of ways:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dropouts from the class of 2006 cost the state more than $31 billion in lost wages, taxes, and productivity over their lifetimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Texas's likely dropouts from the class of 2006 graduated instead, the state could save more than $1.6 billion in Medicaid and expenditures for uninsured care over the course of those young people's lifetimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Texas's high schools and colleges raise the graduation rates of Hispanic, African-American, and Native-American students to the levels of  white students by 2020, the potential increase in personal income would add more than $46.5 billion to the state economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing the graduation rate and college matriculation of male students in Texas by only 5 percent could lead to combined savings and revenue of almost $691 million each year by reducing crime-related costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we can reduce these costs exponentially by closing the achievement gaps between underserved students and those who are well served. Closing student achievement gaps is one of the most pressing challenges facing public education. Educators, with the support of the community, must reach all students--students from multiple ethnic, racial, language, and economic backgrounds; students of both genders; and students of comparable ability who are not currently achieving at equal academic  levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, student accountability is very important; however, if we are to hold all students to the same high standards, we must provide all students with the same level of opportunity to reach those high standards. In particular among minority and underserved communities, it is clear that providing children a quality education will take more than just imposing rigorous testing standards and stringent teacher evaluations. Indeed, it will take a village including school staff, parents, business  and community leaders, legislators, and other education groups to fulfill our responsibility of helping a diverse array of students meet high standards. We all know that not all students are situated equally financially, socially or emotionally. Many students are severely limited in their level of academic achievement by virtue of their low-income and impoverished financial status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, minority students also have cultural and language limitations. It is extremely crucial to remember that improving educational achievements within minority and underserved communities requires the need to address culture, language, and economic differences within the educational curriculum. Helping learners make the link between their culture and the new knowledge and skills they encounter inside school is at the heart of ensuring that all students achieve at high levels. In addition,  appreciation of diverse cultures is a philosophical concept built on the American ideals of freedom, justice, equality, equity, and human dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the opportunity to truly make a difference in student achievement among all our children and leave absolutely no child behind if we provide: free, universal preschool; smaller class sizes; a qualified and caring teacher in every classroom; a challenging curriculum; ample resources for all public schools, including those that serve poor and minority students; involved parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can achieve this through my amendment. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment which will give the disadvantaged students in this country the chance to perform at the highest peak of their educational potentials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Texas Parents, Teachers Unhappy With Standardized Testing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GEORGETOWN.--Parents and educators told school trustees they think the state's standardized achievement tests place too much stress on children and limit what they learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speakers complained about the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills at a forum held Tuesday by the school board to hear from the public on topics that included elementary grade alignment and teachers salaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The TAAS, and the TAKS--which replaces the TAAS in the spring, measure students skills in core subjects. The Texas Education Agency uses exam scores to rate districts and campuses. . . .</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise not to oppose this legislation but to raise a very serious concern about a provision in the bill to mandate that the National Institutes of Health, NIH, change its public access policy for journal articles. Under this provision, the current, voluntary program to provide journal articles to NIH will now become a federally mandated requirement that private and nonprofit sector copyright owners provide their materials for posting--free-of-charge--by NIH on its  publicly available websites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sympathize with the laudable goal of widely disseminating the results of publicly-funded research that comprises some of the information contained in these journals. And I am pleased to note that the bill does contain language stating "that the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law." I trust that this provision will mean that the agency must cooperate with journal owners and authors to assure that their rights are fully protected and that they  receive just compensation for this use of their works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I believe this new mandate will have unintended and negative consequences and will set worrisome precedents that may in the future actually diminish the amount of scientific, technical and medical information available to the public. By severely restricting the scope of protection for a critical class of copyrighted works, this provision could ultimately reduce incentives for publishers to continue to make substantial investments in conducting peer review of research prior to publication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this provision could send a mixed message to our trading partners about the importance of intellectual property rights, IPR, to our economy. Such a message may make it difficult to advocate strong IPR protection and enforcement abroad, including the U.S. government's efforts to spread respect for IPR abroad and slow the trend in compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents by other nations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of making quality education and health care available to our children. The last 6 years of Republican budgets created numerous human deficits--in health care, education, child care, and social services. This bill takes America in a new direction, beginning to fill those deficits with long overdue investments in Pell Grants, Head Start, public and special education programs and community health centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has threatened to veto this bill because he claims it is fiscally irresponsible. Only in an absurd parallel universe, where Iraq really had weapons of mass destruction, would increasing the amount of Pell Grants so that low-income students can afford college be considered irresponsible. Only in a fictional world, where abstinence-only education actually works, could increasing funding for childcare and Head Start be irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the real world, these investments will generate valuable returns for--our children and our country. Passage of this bill is essential to repairing the safety net and providing our children with the world class education they need to become engaged and productive citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical for the future of public education that the federal government provide states with the support they need to meet the laudable, but difficult goals set by President Bush's own No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB. Unfortunately, the President has negligently underfunded his own law by $50 million. This bill provides a $2 billion increase in K-12 education funding, rejects the President's proposed cuts for special education programs for the 6.9 million students with disabilities, and expands  the Child Care Block Grant by $75 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's legislation also takes a small step toward improving our broken health care system, in which tens of millions of people are uninsured or underinsured. It expands access to health care for 1.2 million people by funding community health centers and state health access grants. This bill also makes overdue investments in the National Institutes of Health  by providing funds for 545 new research grants. Such grants fund breakthrough discoveries that  can dramatically decrease suffering and disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues recognize that this bill paves the way for a healthier, better educated, and more compassionate society and urge them to join me in voting yes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I come to the floor today to compliment the Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill, Mr. Obey, on preparing an excellent and well-balanced appropriations bill. The large number of meritorious programs included in this bill creates difficult choices and the Chairman has done a great job balancing the competing interests and preparing a good bill for consideration in the full House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, on behalf of my constituents I feel compelled to express one concern with regard to language in the bill that would require NIH funded scientists to submit to the NIH their peer-reviewed manuscripts approved for journal publication. While I believe it is important to expand access to articles on government sponsored research, my concern is that such a mandatory policy could harm some nonprofit scientific societies that depend largely on income generated by their journal publications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A mandatory policy like this could harm journal publishers who make substantial private-sector investments in the peer review, publishing, dissemination and archiving of these research articles. Scientific societies foster and promote our Nation's scientific endeavor, and these societies and their contributions to science should be protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a substantial scientific publishing organization, the American Institute of Physics, in my district, in Melville, New York. The American Institute of Physics, AlP, was established in 1931 for the purpose of promoting physics and its application to human welfare. AlP is a 501(c)(3) membership corporation of ten physical science and astronomy societies serving a combined membership of more than 125,000 scientists, engineers and students. AlP is a large publisher of physics journals and produces  publications of more than 25 scientific and engineering societies through its New York-based publishing division. My concerns on this issue are to protect and support our Nation's scientific infrastructure and a viable export industry. The issue has been highlighted for me by my constituents in Melville, NY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to voice concerns with the rescission of $335 million from unexpended Workforce Investment Act, WIA, funds included in the bill. I fully support increasing funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Act, IDEA, the program this rescinded WIA funding was redirected towards in an amendment during full committee consideration of the bill. I've advocated for increasing funding for IDEA since I first came to Congress in 2000. However, I am concerned about the use of WIA as an offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unexpended WIA funding is not actually "unspent carryover." It is either obligated for services, such as training, or set aside to respond to mass layoffs and other unpredictable economic events. And the Government Accountability Office, in a study on WIA expenditures, found that WIA funds are spent "much faster than required under the law." WIA regulations give local governments three years to spend Title I-B Adult and two years to spend Youth and Dedicated Worker funds. Local governments  have been complying with the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, carryover was an intentional spending strategy built into WIA as a planned management strategy to assure proper and consistent operation of the workforce system. Since the WIA system must respond to unforeseen economic events such as plant closings, mass layoffs or disaster relief, some funds must be held in reserve to enable immediate response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rescission could impact the local workforce system and their ability to train workers. It is estimated that my state's share of the national rescission would be nearly $28 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the tough choices we need to make in a difficult budget environment and believe the Chairman prepared an excellent bill which I was proud to support in committee and I am proud to support today on the floor. And again, I fully support an increase in funding for IDEA. However, I wanted to express this concern regarding WIA rescissions and highlight the impact it can have on states like mine.</paragraph>
