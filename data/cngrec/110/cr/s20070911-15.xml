  <narrative>MONTANA'S 819TH RED HORSE SQUADRON -- (Senate - September 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11405">S11405</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know that over the last 6 years every Senator has had to send some of their sons and daughters in their State off to war, but today is the first time as a Member of this body I have had to see so many members of a squadron in my State deployed. So it is with great pride that I rise to honor the 400 air men and women of the Air Force's 819th RED HORSE Squadron. About one-half of this squadron is deploying today for training in Wisconsin before going to Iraq later this  year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last decade, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, MT, has been the home of the 819th RED HORSE Squadron. For the uninitiated, RED HORSE stands for rapid engineer deployable heavy operation repair squadron engineer. Basically, these are the men and women who rebuild Air Force facilities overseas, such as runways. They also have spent considerable time in Iraq rebuilding schools and homes. These are men and women who do some truly wonderful work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a previous deployment to Iraq in 2005, the squadron was involved in 130 construction projects on 12 different bases in Iraq. The 819th has served in Afghanistan and Qatar. In every place they have taken on complicated engineering projects for the U.S. Government but have also done outstanding work with locals to rehabilitate housing and provide residents with everything from coloring books for kids to new washing machines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a combination of accomplishment, strength, and generosity that represents the best of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This afternoon, as the men and women of the 819th begin to train for  the mission that will send them to Iraq, they leave behind spouses, children, and other family members. We know that piano recitals and football games will be missed this fall. There will be an empty chair at too many holiday meals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 819th is an Active Associate unit, meaning that it is compromised of both Active-Duty airmen and Air National Guardsmen. For the citizen soldiers of our Air Guard, these deployments can be especially difficult, and I hope all Montanans will keep these airmen and their families in their thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when they return home, we have a moral responsibility to care for the folks who have worn the uniform of our country. Whether they return to Active Duty or reenter civilian life, the Federal Government must support them. Congress has taken numerous steps this year to provide more resources for the VA and to improve the quality of life for our troops. I hope we will continue to make progress in these areas so that when the 819th comes home we are able to welcome these airmen back home with  our deeds and not just our words.</paragraph>
