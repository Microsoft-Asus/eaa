    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to pay tribute to a great American who fought tirelessly against injustice and inequality, using education as both his sword and his shield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charles D. Tildon, Jr., left this Earth on December 15, 2007, at the age of 81. Affectionately known as Charlie, he was born in my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, to Charles G. Tildon, Sr., a preacher, and Estrom Elizabeth Tildon, a teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His belief in the power of education was formed at a very young age. He and his brother, Dr. Tyson Tildon, were raised to pursue excellence, despite living in an era of overt and permeating racism. Not only did they pursue excellence, but they achieved it in every task they took on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both brothers, now reunited in heaven, embodied the virtues of dignity, integrity, and brilliance. Charlie received a degree in biology from the then Morgan State College and graduated from Frederick Douglass High School. He had a long and successful career that culminated with the post of the president of Baltimore City College, from which he retired in 1985. Along the way, he held positions as a middle school science teacher, associate director of Provident Hospital, executive director of the  Maryland Service Corps, and assistant secretary of the Maryland Department of Human Resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His career trajectory as well as his community engagement were fueled by his desire to help others reach their fullest potential. Charles Tildon was indeed a trailblazer. In 1969, he became one of the first African American trustees for the Maryland Institute College of Arts. He also contributed his talents and his time to several community organizations, including Associated Black Charities and Open Society Institute. He combined his leadership capabilities with a passion for justice to help  organize movements for social change. He was a founding member of the organization BLEWS, the Black/Jewish Forum of Baltimore, which was created in 1978 as an effort to overcome estrangement between African Americans and Jews. Charlie Tildon understood the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was blessed to call Charlie my mentor and my friend. He was a role model to me and so many others. He taught us that our intellect is our greatest strength and, with it, we have a voice that we cannot be silenced. He also taught us that there are trying moments in our lives when we simply cannot remain silent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He co-edited a collection of essays called Clairvoyance: Reweaving the Fabric of the Community for Black Folk. This visionary blueprint included discussions by some of Baltimore's most gifted thinkers about the relationship between our schools and the community in which we live. It concluded that we must become a community of learning if we are to become a society in which all people have the opportunity to succeed. Clairvoyance is just one example of how Charlie put education at the forefront  of a march for human rights which everyone can join.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fervently believe in our responsibility to create communities of learning to provide all children with equal educational opportunity and to teach them how to use their minds to overcome bigotry and hatred. Charlie helped to shape that belief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did he selflessly serve his community, but he cherished his role as a husband and as a father. I know I speak for all of those who had the privilege of knowing Charlie when I say his presence in our lives was present enough. He saw his life as a vessel to help others to succeed. I can think of no greater legacy. My prayers are with his wife of 49 years, Louise Tildon, his son Charles Tildon III, and his two grandchildren and his entire family. I thank them for sharing him with us, and  I thank God for Charles Tildon's life of extraordinary service and unbounded grace.</paragraph>
