  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is the 98th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12 year sentences respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents never should have been prosecuted, yet the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler, who claimed he was unarmed. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his  civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, he is not an American citizen. He is a criminal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas also prosecuted another law enforcement officer, Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez, who was doing his job to protect the American people. This makes no sense. Citizens across this country and many of us in Congress want to know why does the Federal prosecutor in western Texas choose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting illegal aliens who commit crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have not forgotten agents Ramos and Compean, who should never have been sentenced to jail. Instead, they should be commended for trying to protect the American people. I encourage citizens across this country to continue calling the White House and asking the President to use his authority to immediately pardon these two heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us in Congress are concerned about the Federal prosecutor in this case and the justification for the criminal charges brought against these agents. Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy has already approved Senator Dianne Feinstein's request for an investigation of this case; and just last week in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzales responded to Senator John Cornyn's call for an oversight hearing by promising to fully  cooperate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that the House, under the leadership of House Judiciary chairman John Conyers, will soon hold hearings to look into this injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House will continue to encourage the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, to look into this case, and I ask the American people to continue to call the White House and to complain about this injustice.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
