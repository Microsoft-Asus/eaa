    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a hockey legend whose personality and character remind us all of the human side of sports; Lorne "Gump" John Worsley. During his years playing professional hockey in Minnesota, beginning his career with the St. Paul Saints and finishing with the Minnesota North Stars, he found a special place in the hearts of fans who knew him simply as "the Gumper."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lorne Worsley was born in Montreal, Quebec, on May 14, 1929. As a child, he was given the nickname "Gump" because the cowlick in his hair looked almost identical to that of comic strip character Andy Gump. The nickname would follow him for the rest of his life. Despite growing up penniless during the Great Depression, Gump dreamed of being a professional hockey player, a dream that would lead him into the history books as one of the most memorable and accomplished goalies in hockey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1950, Gump Worsley began his professional hockey career, playing for the St. Paul Saints of the U.S. Hockey League. That year, Gump obtained the first of many future accolades when he was named the league's Rookie of the Year. Two years later, in 1952, Gump joined the National Hockey League's New York Rangers, where his debut season earned him the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Gump Worsley's career progressed, so did his accomplishments. After being acquired by the Montreal Canadiens, his hometown team, in 1963, Gump helped lead the team to four Stanley Cup Championships in the span of 5 years--winning titles in 1965, 1966, 1968, and 1969. During his time with the Canadiens, Gump was awarded the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goalie in both 1966 and 1968. In 1966, his record was 29-14-6 with a goals-against-average of 2.36. In 1968, he amassed a record of 19-9-8,  with an amazing goals-against-average of just 1.98.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1970, Gump joined the Minnesota North Stars, helping fuel the team to the NHL playoffs in three consecutive seasons. Gump Worsley retired from the sport he loved in 1974 with a record of 335-352-150, including 43 shutouts. Over the course of his career, Gump was selected to the National Hockey League's All Star Game four times--in 1961, 1962, 1965, and 1972. After his retirement as a player, Gump remained active in hockey as a scout for the Minnesota North Stars. In 1980, Gump was inducted  into the Hockey Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Gump Worsley passed away on January 26, 2007, at the age of 77. The world of hockey and the State of Minnesota now mourn the passing of a legend. Among his many accomplishments, Gump will be remembered for  not being the "prototypical" athlete and also for not wearing a goalie's mask until the final six games of his career. Fellow hockey legend Lou Nanne described Gump Worsley as "the most unlikely-looking athlete, but when he strapped on the  pads, he was one of the best in the game." Gump Worsley's determination to achieve his goals is an example of success that we can all strive for in our lives, and that is why today we honor "the Gumper."</paragraph>
