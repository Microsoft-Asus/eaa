    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is the 48th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17 of 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11- and 12-year sentences respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. The smuggler's van contained $1 million worth of marijuana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These agents never should have been prosecuted, but they are now handcuffed in Federal prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to the smuggler and prosecuted the agents almost exclusively on the testimony of an admitted drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed. The drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is now suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, he is not an American citizen. He is a criminal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, countless citizens and dozens of Members of Congress want to know why our government is on the wrong side of this case. Over the past 6 months, Members of Congress have repeatedly petitioned President Bush to pardon these agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the agents' conviction, new details continue to emerge that call into question the prosecution and the outcome of this case. Recently, I sent a letter to the President detailing the troubling revelations that the prosecutors in this case may not have provided crucial evidence to the defense. This evidence includes a Homeland Security memo that states two supervisors at the scene knew about the shooting, but failed to report it. This contradicts the prosecution's claim that the agents knew  they did something wrong and tried to cover up the shooting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, Drug Enforcement Agency, DEA, reports have also revealed that the Mexican drug smuggler brought a second load of 752 pounds of marijuana, but the prosecutors succeeded in keeping this information sealed from the jury and the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens across this country and Members of Congress want to know why does the U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas choose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting illegal aliens who commit crimes in this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every day that these men remain behind bars is a travesty of justice. Because the President has so far refused to stand up for justice in this case, last month Agent Ramos was assaulted in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, the President has the power to immediately reverse this injustice by granting a pardon to these two innocent men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to say that the American people have rallied behind these two Border agents who are heroes in this country, not criminals. And it is time that this White House wake up and listen to the American people.</paragraph>
