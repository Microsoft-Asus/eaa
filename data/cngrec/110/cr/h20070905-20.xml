  <narrative>PRIORITIZE CHILDREN'S HEALTH -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10082]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush has threatened to veto a bill that would provide health care insurance to 5 million children who are currently uninsured. The President's reason: The bill is simply too expensive. But what he ignores is the fact that the CHAMP Act is fully paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democratic House is concerned that too many children are growing up without health insurance, making it impossible for them to receive the regular checkups that they need to live long and healthy lives. The CHAMP Act would strengthen the CHIP program, a popular Federal-State health care partnership so we can reach nearly all of the children who are currently eligible for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price tag is an additional $50 billion over 5 years. Again, the President says it is simply too much money. Yet, he has no problem asking this Congress to rubber-stamp a new Iraq war emergency funding bill that press reports say could be as high as $50 billion and that would only last about 5 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time President Bush prioritize the health care needs of our Nation's children. He should simply support the CHAMP Act.</paragraph>
