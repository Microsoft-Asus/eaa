    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's truly my honor to welcome Dr. Mark Harris of Charlotte, North Carolina, to the House of Representatives. He is a dynamic and a true leader in our city, and a graduate of Appalachian State University and Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is currently the senior pastor at First Baptist Church in Charlotte.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is joined in his ministry by his wife, Beth, and their children, Laura, John and Matthew. Under his leadership, the church has become one of the fastest growing Baptist churches in our area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is very straightforward and powerful in his preaching, and he is always challenging his parishioners to rediscover the joy of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. I thank him for being here today.</paragraph>
