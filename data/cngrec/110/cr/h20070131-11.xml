  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the failure of Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act is a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties across America and 4,400 school districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Crook County, OR, this means real cuts in jail beds, sheriffs' patrols, criminal prosecutions and the pursuit of methamphetamine cooks. These services were once funded by timber receipts, but, because of the virtual elimination of timber harvest, a county which once supported seven saw mills employing thousands of people does not have a single operating mill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crook County Judge Scott Cooper says, "The Federal Government has been pursuing a comprehensive strategy of disinvestment in rural communities," and he is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress' inaction hurts our children, too. Central Oregonian Jeff Sanders, president of the Oregon School Boards Association, is here on Capitol Hill with us today pleading for Congress to act on the behalf of the 560,000 K-12 school children in Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Congress must keep the Federal Government's word to timbered communities and pass <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>. Time is running out.</paragraph>
