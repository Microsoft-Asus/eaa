  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Motion to proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 608, a bill (<bill type="h" number="1195">H.R. 1195</bill>) to amend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to make technical corrections, and for other purposes.</narrative>
  <chair> The Senator from California is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very hopeful we can move this bill. When my kids were a little younger, they used to say: Mom, it is a no-brainer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a no-brainer. This is something we need to do. We passed a very important bill several years ago that funds our highways and our transit. As often happens--because the years pass and the studies take place and you find there were errors in such a big bill that encompasses so many programs--there were certain very important transportation projects, highway projects that got stymied because of a technical problem. We also had one account that was oversubscribed and we need to make some  fixes there because that particular account funds research into the state of our bridges, our highways, our transit systems, and we all know with bridges collapsing in America today, we can't short ourselves on the funding. We need to find out exactly what is the state of our fiscal infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a great economy, you can't move people and you can't move goods without a transportation infrastructure. That means roads that are not falling  apart, bridges that are not falling apart, transit systems that work. Especially in this time of more awareness of being efficient, energy efficient, all of this works together as we look at global warming and the best ways to combat that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple bill. Why are we standing here without actually voting on a few amendments that we know some of my Republican friends have? It is because there is a move by some Republican Senators to slow us down, slow down our work. My colleagues heard about it previous to my taking the floor today. Several colleagues talked about the unprecedented number of filibusters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I have to say on the bright side, this is a bill that Senator Inhofe and I have worked very closely on. We agree on it. It is bipartisan in nature. There are a couple of colleagues who don't like a couple of things in here. We will deal with that. We will deal with it, but let's get moving. It seems a shame to have the Presiding Officer sitting in the chair in front of an empty Chamber while the time clicks away and we can't get anything done on a technical corrections bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say everyone is quite aware that we are in an economic slowdown. I look at this bill as a little bit of a ministimulus package, because it will unleash about $1 billion for very important projects already approved. It will unleash those funds. For every billion dollars, tens of thousands of new jobs are created in the construction industry. We have a very long list of people supporting us on this bill. Again, I call on my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle who for some  reason are holding up this bill: Please. We are willing to have votes on your objections in the form of an amendment. We are willing to work with you. We want to get this bill done. The American people need this bill done. There is no reason to get it caught up in other political arguments and questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope I can come out here in short order with the news that my Republican friends have decided to let us go to the amendment process so we can move forward and complete our work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
