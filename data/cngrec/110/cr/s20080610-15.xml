  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand the objection of my good friend from Mississippi. He was not objecting on his own but for someone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hearing we were going to conduct was a hearing entitled "Coercive Interrogation Techniques: Do They Work, Are They Reliable, and What Did the FBI Know About Them?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, Senator Feinstein, as chair of the subcommittee, began chairing a very important hearing on interrogation tactics. The hearing featured a report by the Department of Justice inspector general on tactics at Guantanamo that amounted to torture. The hearing was interrupted by three floor votes, and the chair recessed the hearing until 2 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, we have our weekly caucuses starting at 12:30. But now the minority is objecting to the committee meeting by invoking the 2-hour rule. What this means is that 2 hours after we come into session, there has to be consent to conduct hearings; otherwise, you have to do them during the first 2 hours we are in session. It is very rare there is an objection, but there is today. So I have no alternative but to recess the Senate this afternoon to allow the hearing to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans may not want these abuses to come to light, but I think the American people have a right to know. This is part of a pattern of obstructionism by my friends on the Republican side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want the Senate to debate a bill to reduce gas prices and I want the Senate to debate a bill to extend tax credits for renewable energy, and now they do not want the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing about coercive interrogation tactics. They can try to use Senate rules to silence these debates, but I will use the rules at this time to allow the Judiciary Committee to continue the hearing. As soon as the hearing is over, we are going to be out here to talk about gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope this is framed with a picture that there is a Presidential election going on. We have one Presidential candidate who wants to do something about these high gas prices, wants to do something about the bill to extend tax credits for renewable energy, and we have another candidate who is opposed to this. We know who that candidate is: it is the Senator from the State of Arizona. And I would think that my friend, the Senator from Arizona, who is the Republican nominee, would be concerned  about this delaying tactic not to allow the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on torture. That is what it amounts to.</paragraph>
