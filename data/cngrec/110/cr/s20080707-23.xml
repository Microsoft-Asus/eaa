    <paragraph>Mr. President, recently in Palm Springs, CA, hundreds of people gathered to honor the fine work of Jackie Lee Houston, and to see the plans unveiled for a new plaza to be built in her honor. I am very pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important work and contributions of Jackie Lee Houston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the ceremony, Palm Springs Mayor Steve Pougnet pointed out the amazing contributions of Jackie Lee  Houston. She has been an integral part of the fine work being done at Angel View Crippled Children's Foundation, the Palm Springs Art Museum, the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Palm Springs Opera Guild of the Desert, the Stroke Recovery Center, and Desert AIDS Project. Houston is also the sponsor of the "Jackie Lee Houston Scholarship,"  offering support to residents of the region hoping to pursue post-graduate training in design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is especially fitting that the new Jackie Lee Houston Plaza will offer an entry to the Palm Springs Convention Center because every year the Palm Springs International Film Festival opens there. It is a project that has had Houston's full support. It is also fitting that the plaza will offer visitors a desert landscape where they cannot just enjoy the native plants, but also help to build a sense of community that is so important to Houston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted that the amazing community and philanthropic work of Jackie Lee Houston will be memorialized with this plaza in Palm Springs. I commend Mayor Pougnet and the members of the Palm Springs City Council for their efforts in this regard and, of course, send my very best regards to Jackie Lee Houston.</paragraph>
