  <narrative>MOMENT OF SILENCE IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO HONOR FALLEN HEROES -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6202]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in May of this year I introduced <bill type="hr" number="1183">H. Res. 1183</bill>, a resolution calling for the House to observe a moment of silence on the first legislative day of each month for those killed or wounded in the United States engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am very grateful that last month the Speaker of the House initiated this moment of silence to honor America's fallen heroes. It is my understanding that the Speaker will continue this monthly observance during  votes tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again thank Speaker Pelosi for making this tribute a part of the regular order of the House. This moment of silence will serve as a solemn reminder of the more than 4,000 killed and more than 30,000 wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a thank-you from a grateful Nation. During the month of June, 56 United States servicemembers were killed; 27 in Afghanistan and 29 in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am sure every American shares my heart, which is heavy for the sacrifice of these fallen heroes. We are grateful to all of our men and women in uniform for their courage and for their selfless commitment to duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and her staff for continuing to make this remembrance a reality for those who have sacrificed for our Nation and for their families. We, the House of Representatives, the People's House, should never forget those who have given their life for this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God continue to bless our men and women in uniform, and may God continue to bless the families of our men and women in uniform. And I ask God to continue to bless America.</paragraph>
