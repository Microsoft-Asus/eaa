  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO MAJOR PERRY JEFFERSON -- (Senate - April 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2428">S2428</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Major Perry Jefferson. On April 3, 1969, Major Jefferson was an aerial observer on board an O-1G Bird Dog observation aircraft conducting a reconnaissance mission in the Ninh Thuan Province of Vietnam when the aircraft crashed. After an extensive search, Major Jefferson's body was not recovered and he was subsequently listed Missing in Action. However, in 2001, after 32 years, a Vietnamese national turned over remains that were identified  to be that of Major Jefferson. Today, Major Jefferson was finally laid to rest in our nation's most hallowed grounds in a moving ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While growing up in Colorado, Major Jefferson developed a love for geology, wilderness and the mines of Colorado; so much so, that his code word was Geneva Creek, after a tributary of the North Fork South Platte River in central Colorado. A graduate of Southern Methodist University, Major Jefferson joined the Colorado Air National Guard as a technician and intelligence officer with the 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron when it was mobilized to Vietnam in 1968. Major Jefferson was a committed patriot.  While in Vietnam, he served his Nation with great distinction. Major Jefferson embodies the spirit and character of Colorado, and I commend his service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The return of his remains brings closure to his family and friends. I am grateful to have this opportunity and I hope that the 96,000 Americans missing and unaccounted for while serving their country will eventually receive a similar honor.</paragraph>
