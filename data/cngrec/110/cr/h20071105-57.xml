    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the greatest, most influential book known to man, the Holy Bible. November 18 through 25 is National Bible Week, and it fittingly coincides with Thanksgiving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible teaches us that we have very much to be thankful for. And although we ought to remind one another of this truth at all times, I am glad there is a time set aside for remembering our blessings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Holy Bible teaches that we are all created by God in His image. And as such, each individual has a certain dignity that should be respected. One John 4:7-11 is one of my favorite passages of scripture. It says: Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed His love among us: He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live  through Him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elsewhere, in Matthew 16:24, Jesus tells his disciples that if anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. I particularly like this verse because, coupled with the first passage from 1 John, it reminds me that I am to love God first, others second and myself third. How different would our personal interactions be if we took this to heart and sought to love others in the way that the Bible encourages us to?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a lesson worth learning, to love one another. In a city that oftentimes seems so bitterly divided, glimpses of true peace and genuine care seem so rare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Holy Scripture, which served as guiding light for so many of our Founding Fathers, can also illuminate a path for us today. In spite of all of our differences, there are many things that we have in common: we have a common creator, a common desire to serve our country and a common inherent worth by virtue of being creations of the Almighty. As we go about our daily business, I think it would behoove us to remember that the Good Book teaches to love one another because we have been loved by God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all of the many chapters of my life, the Bible has served as a source of great wisdom, comfort and insight. Whether as a husband, a child, a father, a lawyer, or legislator, I have purposed to rely on the word of God to give direction in times of doubt. I applaud the efforts of my friends here in the people's House and around the country to recognize what is truly a treasure. I hope and pray that each Member of  this House, their staff and all of  our fellow citizens take time in the upcoming weeks to not only reflect on the great truth found in the Bible, but also to count our blessings and to give thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, I am quite sure that my third grade teacher, Mrs. McClain, prayed for my salvation when I was young. I believe my seventh grade reading teacher, Mrs. Cantrell, prayed for me, as did my high school band teacher, Mr. Jim Henry. They joined a long list of relatives, my sister, Annette; my brother, Joe; my great, great grandfather, John Henry Fortson, pastor of the Fishing Creek Baptist Church in Washington, Georgia, for over 40 years. He prayed for the salvation of his children  and grandchildren to seven generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reconfirm tonight that their prayers were fruitful. Jesus is my friend and I am a student of his word, the Bible. I understand His work on the cross as the sole means of my salvation because the Bible has taught me so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tell me so. May all those who prayed for me so diligently reflect in Thanksgiving this year that God has heard their prayers for me, and I will thank the God of the Bible for their prayers which resulted in my salvation according to the plan that He set out in the Bible.</paragraph>
