    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to honor the Madison High School gymnastics team. On February 16, 2007, the Lady Bulldogs won the South Dakota Class A State Gymnastics Title. This impressive accomplishment allowed the Lady Bulldogs to tie the national record of 13 consecutive championship wins. They currently share the national record with Sehome High School in Bellingham, WA, who set the record from 1973 to 1985.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lady Bulldogs finished the season with an outstanding performance at the South Dakota Class A State Gymnastics Meet. With a final score of 141.893 points they not only tied the national record for consecutive State championships, but also set a South Dakota Class A State record. These two records highlight the talent and dedication that has characterized Madison's gymnastics team for the past 13 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Head Coach Maridee Dossett has demonstrated her allegiance to the Lady Bulldogs both as an athlete and a coach. She was a senior on the team that brought home the first State title for the Madison gymnasts in 1995. Since that time, she has continued to contribute to the success of the team through her dedication and strong leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leading Madison to victory was Katie Finck in the uneven bars and floor exercise categories, and Katie Breuer in the balance beam, vault and all around categories. Following the example set by these two gymnasts, the Lady Bulldogs illustrated their extraordinary teamwork and successfully dominated each category of the competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to honor and thank all those dedicated to the Madison Central School District: Head Coach Maridee Dossett, Assistant Coach Kindra Norby, Athletic Director Bud Postma, Principal Sharon Knowlton, and Superintendent Dr. Frank Palleria. The time and effort put forth by these individuals have made it possible for the Lady Bulldogs to be one of the most successful gymnastics teams of all time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize the gymnast's parents for their support and devotion to the team. This great honor was made possible by your encouragement and dedication to your daughters and their teammates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all I would like to congratulate the women who won the State championship this year and all the athletes who have been a part of this record-tying streak. The gymnasts of the 2006-2007 Lady Bulldog team, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Katie Breuer, Kassie Finck, Theresa Knapp, Katie Mackenzie, Heidi Mogck, Mara Riedel, Sara Rogers, Kaitlyn Walker, and Heather Williams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These student-athletes should be very proud of their remarkable achievements over the past years. The inspiration of the gymnasts that began this record success in 1995 has empowered those who have followed in their footsteps and will continue to bring motivation to Madison's student-athletes in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the city of Madison and the State of South Dakota, I am pleased to say congratulations Lady Bulldogs on this impressive national accomplishment and keep up the great work.</paragraph>
