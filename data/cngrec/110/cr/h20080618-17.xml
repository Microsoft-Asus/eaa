  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to a lot of rhetoric on the other side about it is time for a change in America. I agree. It is time for the Democrats to change their votes and stop voting against producing energy that belongs to Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that we do every morning, and we got the opportunity this morning, is to write Hugo Chavez another check for $170 million. We wrote one yesterday, and we will write one tomorrow. Just think of what we could do with $170 million, investing it right here in American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we bring up ANWR, 86 percent of the Democrats voted against that. When we bring up coal-to-liquid technology, 78 percent of the Democrats voted against that. When we bring up developing oil shale exploration, 86 percent of the Democrats voted against that. The Outer Continental Shelf, 83 percent of the Democrats voted against that. Refinery capacity, we are importing gasoline into this country, 96 percent of the Democrats are opposed to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for change. It is time to start producing American resources.</paragraph>
