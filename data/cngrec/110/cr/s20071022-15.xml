    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to honor and give special attention to New Mexico's Fort Union National Monument in Mora County. Located in the Mora Valley between the Santa Fe and Sangre de Cristo mountains, Fort Union established in 1851, dates back to New Mexico's territorial days, protecting the area's inhabitants and trade routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year Fort Union has initiated a new effort called "The New Mexico Volunteers Living History Program." Volunteers in this program will depict the Hispanic soldiers of the 1st New Mexico Volunteers, who were enlisted and stationed at Fort Union during the Civil War. One of the current volunteers is a direct descendent of the 1st New Mexico Volunteers. With some training and drilling, Fort Union hopes to begin presenting living history programs depicting the 1st New Mexico Volunteers in early  spring next year at Fort Union as well as other local venues. Fort Union has also reinstated nighttime candlelight tours, and also hopes to provide a public venue for night sky viewing while partnering with local colleges and universities to interpret the skies, and be used as a classroom venue complementing science curriculums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the work being done at Fort Union to reach out to the community and provide a glimpse of our historic past. The upcoming activities at Fort Union remind us of our rich history in New Mexico, and I commend the staff at the Fort for their efforts and their hard work to further integrate the unique history of the Fort into the surrounding area and expand their role as a resource for local students and residents. I look forward to the advancement of this program in the months to come.</paragraph>
