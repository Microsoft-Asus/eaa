    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days during which Members may revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="642">H.R. 642</bill> into the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="642">H.R. 642</bill>, the College Fire Prevention Act. This legislation is the result of the life work of the late Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us know the commitment of Representative Tubbs Jones to the cause of campus fire safety. Every September, she would come to the floor to advocate for the recognition of September as Campus Fire Safety Month. Because of her efforts, States around the country also recognized September as Campus Fire Safety Month and helped to make students aware of the dangers they face and to ensure that colleges and universities do all they can to assist students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="642">H.R. 642</bill> builds on Representative Tubbs Jones' work to protect students on campus by creating a demonstration program within the Department of Education to encourage colleges and universities to install fire sprinkler systems and other fire suppression and prevention technologies in student housing and dormitories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no better time to talk about campus fire safety than now, when our students are returning to schools. We all know that in the hustle and bustle of moving in and getting ready for class, thoughts of whether one is prepared for a fire can sometimes get lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, August and September are two of the most fatal months for campus fires. We can assist institutions in avoiding these preventable tragedies by encouraging colleges and universities to educate students about fire safety before they arrive on campus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In passing this legislation here today, we not only honor the work of Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones, but we also ensure the safety of students on campus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the passage of this timely and important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="642">H.R. 642</bill>, the Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones College Fire Prevention Act, and I join my colleagues in honoring our colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So often in this Chamber, we consider legislation to expand access to college and strengthen our Federal higher education programs. Today, we have an opportunity to discuss the need to bolster safety on college campuses, specifically fire safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The timing and the name of this bill are appropriate because this month is often designated as Campus Fire Safety Month, and there was no Member more concerned about protecting our college students from the dangers of fire than the late Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones. This bill would honor Representative Tubbs Jones by naming a demonstration program in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's college students should be able to live on campus with the confidence that they will be safe in their dorms, apartments, or other housing. This measure will take a step toward ensuring that colleges have the ability to ensure their buildings are properly equipped with the latest fire safety measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure, combined with the provisions enacted by Congress in the Higher Education Opportunity Act, will increase campus fire safety on colleges and universities. The provisions included in the Higher Education Opportunity Act required colleges to provide a fire safety report to the Secretary of Education. The report must include statistics showing the number of fires and injuries resulting from fires on campus over the past year. It will also require colleges to report on the type of fire  prevention technologies they are utilizing and any plans the colleges may have to improve their fire prevention and detection technologies. The bill before us today will help colleges think creatively about fire safety and ensure that they have the funds to move forward with their plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have the opportunity to honor Representative Tubbs Jones' commitment to the safety of college students and pass a measure that will help colleges keep our young people safe from devastating fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, our efforts to help college students will be incomplete until we also approve a true and honest all-of-the-above energy reform package that puts our Nation on the path to energy independence. Our higher education system is being squeezed by high energy costs just as the rest of society is. Schools are being forced to limit their operations and reduce the number of school days just to save on utility costs and save their students the price  of a day's commute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority met behind closed doors to craft a bill that offers more in the way of political cover than actual energy reform. This is not the change Americans need, and it's not the change they deserve. We need a real energy policy, not one that looks good on paper but keeps vital American resources under lock and key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to recognize the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me begin by thanking Representative SUSAN DAVIS for allowing me to participate in this session here this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to say a personal word about my dear friend Stephanie Tubbs Jones, who was a powerful voice for justice, equality and opportunity, who served the people of Ohio's 11th Congressional District and this Nation with passion and dedication. Unfortunately, Stephanie passed away unexpectedly last month, and it is a great loss to this cause and to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her five terms in Congress, Representative Tubbs Jones tirelessly advocated for campus fire safety and was the author of numerous pieces of legislation on the issue. She introduced, and saw pass, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Campus Fire Safety Month. She was also the primary sponsor of the College Fire Prevention Act, which she introduced in the 107th Congress and then reintroduced in the 108th, the 109th and the 110th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here today to pay tribute to her efforts as a champion for campus fire safety and am proud to take her place as the lead sponsor of the College Fire Prevention Act so that we can continue her legacy by passing this important measure and renaming it the Stephanie Tubbs Jones College Fire Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Stephanie Tubbs Jones College Fire Prevention Act will establish a demonstration incentive program within the Department of Education to promote the installation of fire sprinkler systems, or other fire suppression or prevention technologies, in qualified student housing or dormitories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January 2000, over 125 people have died in campus-related fires, with over 83 percent of them occurring in off-campus housing. That is why National Campus Fire Safety Month is focused on educating students about fire safety so they can be prepared no matter where a fire should ignite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has not ignored this growing problem. We realize that knowledge is power, and that is why we passed the provisions of the Campus Fire Safety Right-to-Know Act in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, which became law last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation requires the Secretary of Education to report the number of campus-related fires that have occurred and the number of deaths and interests that resulted from those fires. The report will also contain the number of residence hall rooms equipped with automatic fire sprinkler systems and fire alarms. It is also important that this report give parents and students an understanding of how much fire prevention training is provided to students and staff, the college or university's  fire safety policies, and any future plans for improving fire safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly a year ago, I took to this floor to offer my condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of students lost in a fire at Ocean Isle, North Carolina. Seven students perished in that fire; six from the University of South Carolina, which I proudly represent in this body, and one from Clemson University. At that time, we mourned their lives and the future promise they held and the fact that they were cut short in such a dramatic way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, today, I think we can see the legacy of their lives in this room. We have made strides in promoting campus fire safety because of their moving stories, and we will continue to improve campus fire safety to prevent other families from sharing in this tragic experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I'm here to pay that favor forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I add my voice to those here today to pay tribute to Representative Tubbs Jones' courageous efforts and say that I am committed to the issue of campus fire safety.</paragraph>
