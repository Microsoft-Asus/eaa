    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>) to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Inland Empire regional recycling project and in the Cucamonga Valley Water District recycling project, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>, as amended, introduced by our colleague, Congressman Dreier of California, is to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Inland Empire regional water recycling project and in the Cucamonga Valley Water District satellite recycling plant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>, as amended, would add approximately 100,000 acre-feet of new water annually to one of the largest recycled water distribution systems in the Santa Ana River Watershed. Some of the recycled water will be used to reclaim the groundwater basin and help drought-proof the service area. These water recycling plants will develop recycled water near where it will be used, offsetting the energy costs associated with pumping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Subcommittee on Water and Power held hearings on similar legislation in the 108th Congress. In the 109th Congress, similar legislation was passed by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>, as amended, will provide a very modest amount of Federal financial assistance to help in the construction of these worthy water recycling projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support <bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>, as amended, and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>, sponsored by our colleague, David Dreier, authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in two water recycling projects in Southern California that will allow the water districts there to be less reliant on imported water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the water demand grows and supplies become more scarce in Southern California, this bill would help to drought-proof this arid area. These projects would add over 75,000 acre-feet of water annually to one of the last recycled water distribution systems in the Santa Ana River Watershed. This legislation passed the House during the past two Congresses, and I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the sponsor of this piece of legislation, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. As I was just told by a distinguished member of the committee staff, we hope that the third time is a charm here. We have been pursuing this for quite a while, and I hope very much that we will be able to see final implementation of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize the leadership again on both sides of the aisle; the Committee on Natural Resources, of course, Mr. Bishop, who served with great distinction on the Committee on Rules. And I will say that we miss him upstairs in the Rules Committee. I especially miss the fact that we are no  longer in the majority up in the Rules Committee, but he is serving very ably now as an important member of the Natural Resources Committee and  the Water and Power Subcommittee. And I want to thank, of course, on the majority side the distinguished chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rahall, my very good friend from California (Mrs. Napolitano) with whom I worked closely on this, and of course the ranking member on the subcommittee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and of course the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Young.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to really underscore the great commitment and support that was provided in this effort by my California colleague, Mrs. Napolitano, who was an original cosponsor of this bill and has long been a great champion for many, many years of regional water solutions. I am also very pleased to have had the continued support and cosponsorship of other Southern California colleagues in a bipartisan way, Ken Calvert, Gary Miller, and of course I am pleased to see that we have just  been joined on the floor here by my good friend, who represents the Inland Empire, Mr. Baca. And I should say, Mr. Speaker, that I just signed one of those cosponsor sheets and turned it in at the desk that will now include Mr. Baca's name as one of the cosponsors of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you will recall, this bill was passed, as I said, by the last Congress; but it was held up in the other body over issues that were much larger regarding overall reform of the Bureau of Reclamation's title 16 program. And I do share the concern that the program, while hugely popular, successful and competitive, is oversubscribed and underfunded. That being said, Mr. Speaker, the need to reform the program shouldn't hold back good projects like this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inland Empire Water Recycling Initiative authorizes $30 million for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District to assist in constructing two water recycling projects. The projects will produce nearly 100,000 acre-feet of new water annually to the area's water supply. This initiative has the support of all member agencies of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, which encompasses 240 square miles in Southern California. It also serves a number of cities that I  am very honored to be able to represent, the cities of Rancho Cucamonga, Upland and Montclair, some of the fastest growing cities in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These water agencies are using high-quality recycled water in many water intensive applications like landscape and agricultural irrigation, construction and industrial cooling. This allows fresh water to be conserved or used for drinking, which reduces our dependence on expensive imported water. In addition, by recycling water which would otherwise be wasted and unavailable, these agencies ensure that we wring the last drop of use out of water before it is ultimately returned to the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we continue to approve measures preventing water supply shortages in the western United States. And, Mr. Speaker, this recycling initiative will help meet the water needs of the Inland Empire and begin a strategic Federal-local partnership to bring a significant amount of new water supply to this very important region in Southern California. This project has already been recognized nationally as one of the most cost-effective water reuse projects that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inland Empire Utility Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District are innovative leaders in using high-quality recycled water in environmentally sensitive and creative ways. This allows fresh water to be conserved for drinking, reducing our dependence on expensive imported water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hard work of these two local water agencies should be recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to specifically recognize the tireless efforts of Rich Atwater, the CEO of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, and Robert DeLoach, the CEO of the Cucamonga Valley Water District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to commend the boards of these agencies for their leadership in providing our region with safe, clean, and affordable water. And I will say, Mr. Speaker, that at a time when we are focusing constantly on the need to look at ways to recycle and focusing on the issue of environmentally sound planning for our future, meeting our needs, this measure is, again, a model that can be used for the rest of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this juncture, I would be happy to yield to my very good friend, with whom I am privileged to share representing part of the Inland Empire, Mr. Baca.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the comments by Mr. Dreier. I appreciate his leadership on this important issue of water. It is critical to the Inland Empire. This is one that needs to be addressed, and he has constantly addressed the issues of water in the Inland Empire, not only now, but in the past. And I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="122">H.R. 122</bill>, the Inland Empire recycling project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate Grace Napolitano's leadership in this endeavor because this is a bipartisan effort for the Inland Empire and its region in the area. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, but an issue that pertains to water and water that is important to a lot of us in that region and throughout the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project is important for my district. And he not only mentioned his district that covers Upland and Rancho Cucamonga, but it is important for my district and across Southern California because it would help solve California's state-wide water shortage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all have been warned about global warming and the impact it is going to have in terms of the future and the possibility of the lack of water. Well, this addresses some of that. By recycling the water in our region, we will be able to increase the local water supply and reduce our dependence on imported water from San Francisco Bay delta area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The Bureau of Reclamation has ranked this project as one of the most cost-effective new water supply projects in California; I state, the most effective, cost-effective water supply projects in California. And it is also endorsed by all cities, including Fontana and Ontario, as well as community groups and business groups, and environmental leader groups, and I state, environmental groups and leaders throughout the Inland Empire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to give my full support, and I urge my colleagues to do the same on this important issue on water that impacts not only the Inland Empire but the State of California, and I ask full support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank my friend for his very able contribution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, in closing that I think that this legislation underscores once again how the California congressional delegation continues, as it has in the past, to work in a bipartisan way addressing priority concerns that we have, whether it be transportation, dealing with the whole issue of base closure, dealing with the challenge of illegal immigration, dealing with this very important water resources issue, health care issues. California's delegation is working together in  a bipartisan way to address them, and this legislation today is evidence of our great success at implementing the shared vision that we have for the constituents whom we are honored to represent in California. And I again thank both Democrats and Republicans on the Natural Resources Committee for their strong support of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, as Mr. Baca said, I hope very much that the committee and others will utilize this very successful program as a model for future water recycling.</paragraph>
