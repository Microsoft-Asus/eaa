  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES H. ADAMS -- (Senate - April 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2292">S2292</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, James H. Adams of Pittsfield, NH, retired as manager of the New Hampshire/Vermont District of the U.S. Postal Service after 35 years of service. I wish to thank Jim for all he has done for the people of New Hampshire over that time and for his efforts which have resulted in New Hampshire's outstanding reputation for mail operations, customer service, and worker safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Starting as a letter carrier in Manchester in 1973, Jim's career began when the price of a stamp cost a whopping 3 cents for a first class letter. His determination and drive for self-improvement soon led to night school classes and a degree in business management, and his talents were recognized with promotion to delivery supervisor, then superintendent of postal operations, in Concord, NH. He left our State for a time, tackling the duties of director of marketing for the Post Office in Syracuse,  NY, then in a number of positions of increasing responsibility with the Postmaster General's Office in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in Washington, Jim worked with five U.S. Presidents and helped to develop several commemorative stamps, including those honoring our troops of Desert Storm, POW/MIAs, and even Elvis. He unveiled five World War II commemorative stamps to President George H. W. Bush in the Oval Office and was relied upon in Washington for his professional and personal knowledge of all facets of postal operations, his competent advice, and for the personal integrity with which he always conducted  himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His return to New Hampshire to head the district in 1997 led to dramatic improvements in its operations. Overseeing a $500 million budget and 7,000 employees, Jim turned the district into one of the top 10 safest in the Nation. Similarly, with 6 million pieces of mail delivered each day in New Hampshire and Vermont, Jim's efforts led to a 96-percent on-time mail delivery record and the establishment of customer service that has been recognized as Best in the Nation for each of the past 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his professional accomplishments, which are many, Jim has remained true to his small-town roots and the honesty and decency of his upbringing. Pittsfield and all of New Hampshire can be proud of him and his success, and I am especially glad to have had the opportunity to work with Jim to serve the people of New Hampshire. Whether helping obtain a sought-after ZIP Code number to serve an entire community or making a personal commitment to ensuring an elderly or disabled customer off the  beaten track received their mail at home, Jim dedicated himself to meeting the needs of those who counted on the U.S. mail coming through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He can take great pride in his record of service. I want to take this opportunity to thank him, to recognize his contributions, and to wish him well in all his future endeavors.</paragraph>
