  <narrative>RETIREMENT OF MR. DAVID J. WILLIAMS -- (Senate - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="89">S89</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate David J. Williams for his 30 years of service to the vaccine industry and Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams was born in Scranton, PA, and received his accounting degree from the University of Scranton in 1973. He then joined Connaught Laboratories in 1978 as the manager of financial services. Mr. Williams was a member of the executive team and was named chief operating officer of Connaught Laboratories in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams steered the company through several mergers and acquisitions, growing the organization from 100 employees and sales of just over $5 million in 1978, to the creation of today's Sanofi Pasteur, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer with 11,000 employees and more than $4 billion in sales in 2007. Under Mr. Williams' guidance, more than a billion doses of Sanofi Pasteur's lifesaving vaccines are administered to more than 500 million people around the world each year, representing  more than 25 percent of the global vaccine market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams recognized his company's ability to address current and future public health needs by investing in a research and development program and a production plan for pandemic preparedness in the event that a public health emergency strikes the United States. Mr. Williams and Sanofi Pasteur have helped to build the domestic infrastructure necessary to protect millions of Americans from deadly diseases, while addressing public health around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams has served as an advocate for the survival of the vaccine industry. I am told that in 1986, when the industry was being diminished by lawsuits, he served as the industry point person for negotiation of The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, which established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. In his dedication to the larger immunization community, he created the Vaccine Policy Committee of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and is a founding  member of the Partnership for Prevention which includes public and private sector representatives who focus on preventative health care policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams served as the first liaison member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which sets immunization policy in the United States. He has also served on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania, the Hospital Service Association of Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the Board of Regents of the University of Scranton. He is one of the founding board members  of the Medical Education Development Consortium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am advised that Mr. Williams has cultivated a culture of community involvement at Sanofi Pasteur and demonstrated a commitment to philanthropy through the company's contributions to United Way and donations of vaccines through UNICEF, the Global Alliance for Vaccines Immunization, GAVI, the World Health Organization's Global Polio Eradication Initiative and various humanitarian relief efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams has also been committed to the economic growth and development of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This includes expanding the impressive campus in Swiftwater to maintain a domestic manufacturing base for many vaccines, including influenza. Under his guidance, Sanofi Pasteur has grown to be the largest private employer in Monroe County and a purchaser of over $145 million in goods and services from Pennsylvania-based vendors. I have been pleased to assist in this important expansion  through appropriation of Federal funding which not only benefits the county but the entire Commonwealth and Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 16, 2008, after 30 years of service, David J. Williams will retire as the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Sanofi Pasteur. I commend Dr. Williams for his distinguished career and leadership in the advancement of immunizations and the eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases.</paragraph>
