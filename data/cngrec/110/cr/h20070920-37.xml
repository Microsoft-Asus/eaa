  <narrative>UNJUST PROSECUTION OF FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10690]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is day 247 of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents have now been in prison for more than 8 months. Since the agents' conviction, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to pardon these two men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many in this country are disappointed that the prison sentence of Scooter Libby was committed, while these two law enforcement officers are still in prison. Mr. Libby did not spend one day in prison, yet two decorated Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11 and 12 years in prison. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were enforcing our  laws, not breaking the laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS for his concern and interest in this case. I also want to thank Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman BILL DELAHUNT who, prior to the August recess, held a hearing to examine the Mexican Government's influence in this case. I am hopeful that Chairman JOHN CONYERS will see to it that the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing within the next 30 to 45 days to fully examine this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this case in July 2007, additional questions remain about how this prosecution was initiated and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. Since that time, it has become clear that not only  did the prosecution prevent the jury from hearing evidence that the smuggler brought a second load of drugs across our border, but this smuggler was also given free access to our country during and  after the second smuggling incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want to know why did the U.S. Attorney's Office continue to produce these border agents even after the credibility of the drug smuggler was shattered. This is a question that U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton needs to answer. By shedding light on the questionable actions of the prosecution in this case, I am hopeful that this gross miscarriage of justice can be corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to say to the families of Border Patrol agents Compean and Ramos that this Congress is not going to forget this injustice; and we're going to turn this injustice to justice for these two men. They deserve it. God bless them and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And may God bless our men and women in uniform, and may God continue to bless America.</paragraph>
