  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="Introducing S. 2400. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to require the Secretary of Defense to continue to pay to a member of the Armed Forces who is retired or separated from the Armed Forces due to a combat-related injury certain bonuses that the member was entitled to before the retirement or separation and would continue to be entitled to if the member was not retired or separated, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2400">S. 2400</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased today to offer a bipartisan bill to fix a serious loophole in the law that has prevented some of our wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan from receiving their full enlistment bonuses when they are discharged as the result of wounds they receive in combat. The Wounded Warrior Bonus Equity Act reflects the hard work of several Members of Congress, who put partisanship aside to address this serious matter. The men and women of our magnificent armed  forces serve with incredible courage and bravery. In return, the U.S. makes a commitment to them, and the Government must fulfill its end of the bargain.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 2402. A bill to provide for the substitution of the United States in certain civil actions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2402">S. 2402</bill>] Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Substitution Act of 2007, to substitute the Federal Government for the telephone companies in litigation challenging the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program. This is a very complex issue, and I have been discussing it at length with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. It does raise some very important questions, and I begin my analysis by acknowledging the good citizenship of the telephone  companies for whatever it is that they have done. We still don't know all of what that is. But I do not believe that it is appropriate to grant what is called "retroactive immunity" because of what has occurred here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation substitutes the U.S. in place of any electronic communication service company which provided communications in connection with an intelligence activity that was authorized by the President between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007, and designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack against the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for substitution to apply, the electronic communications service provider must have received a written request from the Attorney General or the head of an element of the intelligence community indicating that the activity was authorized by the President and determined to be lawful. If the provider assisted the Government beyond what was requested in writing, this legislation will leave the provider on the hook for any surplus assistance. On the other hand, the Government will be substituted  if the Attorney General certifies that the electronic communications service provider did only what the Government asked. Once substitution occurs, Federal and State courts are directed to dismiss the providers from the action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides that plaintiffs in these cases may continue to send third-party discovery requests such as Rule 45 subpoenas to the electronic communications service providers after they have been dismissed. Moreover, the bill provides that plaintiffs may also deem provider admissions as Government admissions in their case against the Government. My legislation provides that the Government will not have sovereign immunity in the 40 or so cases currently pending in the California Multi-District  Litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides authority for the U.S. to remove actions from State court to Federal court. Notably, the legislation is intended to ensure that the Government can only assert those defenses the electronic communications companies may assert under current law. On the other hand, nothing in the bill is designed to increase or diminish the ability of the Government to assert the States Secret privilege. The legislation is carefully crafted so as not to disturb plaintiffs' standing to bring their  claims against the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, recognizing the telephone companies are good citizens, I am prepared to see their involvement held to the minimum. We hear concerns about them being involved in litigation. Well, I don't know if there's much litigation  for them to be involved in once the Federal Government is substituted. Some express dismay over the continued burden of discovery. I am not convinced there will be much further discovery here. Some have expressed a reticence to having  their service technicians, in-house counsel, and other employees called as witnesses. Yet, I don't know that they are necessarily going to be witnesses. We can't judge that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there are very important--perhaps even constitutional--privacy issues here that ought to be subjected to judicial review. We know that important litigation in the Federal court in San Francisco, Judge Walker has declined to dismiss a challenge to the Terrorist Surveillance Program on State secrets grounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think Congress can stand by, and in the face of what has happened, give carte blanche, a free ticket, grant retroactive immunity to suggest to future administrations that they can ignore separation of powers and they can ignore Congressional oversight and just run roughshod over the entire process without being held accountable. The better practice is to allow judicial proceedings to take their course and let the courts make their own determinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, to carefully consider this bill as we begin to debate the related FISA Amendments Act of 2007.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="Introducing S. 2403. A bill to designate the new Federal Courthouse, located in the 700 block of East Broad Street, Richmond, Virginia, as the &quot;Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr. Federal Courthouse&quot;; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2403">S. 2403</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to name the new Richmond courthouse for two distinguished Virginia jurists, Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III and Judge Robert Merhige, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the selection of the College of William and Mary as the site for the Nation's first law school, Virginia's contribution to the field of law is arguably without equal. Virginia practitioners such as George Wythe, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, James Monroe and Henry Clay have all profoundly shaped and molded our country's legal traditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing in that rich tradition, Judge Spottswood W. Robinson, III, and Judge Robert Merhige, Jr. were lawyers who throughout their careers adhered to the principles of "equal justice under law."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spottswood William Robinson, III was born in Richmond, Virginia on July 26, 1916. He attended Virginia Union University and then Howard University School of Law, graduating first in his class in 1939 and serving as member of the faculty until 1947.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Robinson was one of the core attorneys of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund from 1948 to 1960, achieving national prominence in the legal community with his representation of the Virginia plaintiffs in the 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education that declared "separate but equal" schools unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, Judge Robinson became the first African-American to be appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. In 1966, President Johnson appointed Judge Robinson the first African-American to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the first African-American to serve as Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Merhige was born in New York in 1919 and attended High Point College in North Carolina. Later, he earned his law degree from T.C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond, from which he graduated at the top of his class in 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1942 to 1945, Judge Merhige served in the United States Air Force and then practiced law in Richmond from 1945 until 1967. While practicing in Richmond, Judge Merhige established himself as a formidable trial lawyer representing a wide variety of clients. In August of 1967, Judge Merhige was appointed U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division by President Lyndon B. Johnson, where he served for over 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While on the Federal bench, Judge Merhige presided over some of the most important and complicated litigation in U.S. history. In 1970, he ordered the University of Virginia to admit women, and 2 years later he ordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia school districts. As evidence of Judge Merhige's groundbreaking decisions, he was given 24-hour protection by Federal marshals, due to repeated threats of violence against him and his family. His courage in the face of the significant opposition  of the times is a testimony to his dedication to the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been down to Richmond to see the new courthouse, and I can tell you it is a magnificent structure, and as such, I carefully took this responsibility in naming the U.S. Federal courthouse in Richmond. No name is more fitting for this important structure than naming it after two legal giants--both jurists--the Robinson-Merhige Federal Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senate for the consideration of this bill and look forward to working with my colleagues seeking its passage.</paragraph>

Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige, Jr. Federal Courthouse&quot;; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to speak on behalf of a bill I have cosponsored with my distinguished colleague, the senior senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is altogether appropriate that the new Federal courthouse in Richmond, our Commonwealth's capital and a city that played a pivotal role in our Nation's civil rights debate, be named in honor of two of Virginia's most distinguished citizens, Judge Spottswood Robinson, III, and Judge Robert Merhige, Jr. Both of these men are considered consummate Federal jurists, and both will be remembered as fierce defenders of the Constitution and the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Robinson was born in Richmond on July 26, 1916 and passed away at his home in Virginia on October 11, 1998. Judge Robinson attended Virginia Union University and achieved a number of "firsts." He graduated first in his class from Howard University's School of Law. He was the first African-American to be appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Also, he was the first African-American to be appointed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  and the first African-American to serve as chief justice of that court. Judge Robinson served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and as dean of Howard University Law School. Of his long and distinguished career, one of his most notable accomplishments was serving as counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and acting as one of the principal attorneys in Brown v. The Board of Education, arguably the most important civil rights case of the twentieth century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professor Jack Greenberg of Columbia University Law School, an authority on civil rights law stated, "[Judge Robinson] was an exceptionally capable lawyer. He was good with judges and juries. He knew the law. He knew some of the esoteric, technical, sort of obscure parts of legal history." Considering Judge Robinson's arguments before the Supreme Court, Professor Greenberg said, "He was very calm and just absolutely brimming with facts and information and legal doctrine."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Merhige was born February 5, 1919, in New York, and after 31 years on the bench, passed away in Richmond on February 18, 2005. Judge Merhige presided over the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia from 1967 until 1998. Judge Merhige received his law degree from the University of Richmond's T.C. Williams School of Law. In 1972, Judge Merhige courageously ordered the desegregation of dozens of Virginia school districts. Despite numerous threats and receiving 24-hour protection  by Federal authorities, Judge Merhige remained faithful to the Constitution and the rule of law. Judge Merhige ordered the University of Virginia to admit women in 1970 and rejected appeals by defendants in the Watergate case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A friend of many years, Governor Gerald Baliles, once stated Judge Merhige was, "a man of civility and courage, a gentle but vibrant force of the legal realm. ..... [Judge Merhige] was a master of wit and could puncture the pomposity of lawyers as well as engage in acts of self-deprecation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two men were bold enough to recognize and fight to ensure that the rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution are enjoyed by everyone, and not just the privileged or members of a certain race, religion, or socio-economic group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of Judge Robinson and Judge Merhige will be etched on the walls of this courthouse. I am committed to ensuring that their legacy of equality and fundamental fairness persists in the hearts of all Virginians.</paragraph>
