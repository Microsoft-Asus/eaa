  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last November, the American people demanded a new direction for America. Democrats are now providing that new direction, consistently bringing with them more than 60 Republicans on all the major votes, and they are delivering results on the priorities of the American people. Let me quote from a random sample of newspapers around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Seattle Post Intelligencer wrote, "Well, slap us twice and call us Betty, the Democrats in Congress actually accomplished what they pledged to do, on schedule no less."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Charlotte Observer concluded, "House Democrats are getting high marks from the public for their legislative moves in the first 100 hours of the new session of Congress. They are on the right road."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote, "Democrats in the House made good on their promise to pass significant legislation during their first 100 hours in power. Actually, it took less than that time to pass the six bills the House Democrats hailed as their top priorities. This belies the perception that nothing ever gets done in Washington."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether it is because they elected Democrats or because we put a woman in charge, but things are happening in this House, and they are all good.</paragraph>
