  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the Democrats' 100-hour agenda, the House overwhelmingly passed six bills that are going to make a real impact on the lives of everyday Americans. We have done what we said we are going to do and what the American people wanted to us do, and most important, we did it in a strong bipartisan fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-eight Republicans joined us in implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations; 82 Republicans joined us in raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years; and 124 Republicans joined us in cutting in half the interest rates on student loans. These bills received strong bipartisan support because they are important to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that as we move forward we can continue to move legislation that can garner the support of both Republicans and Democrats in this House so that we can continue to make the lives of the American people better.</paragraph>
