  <narrative>HUNGER PROVISIONS IN THE FARM BILL -- (Senate - December 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15641">S15641</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there has been a great deal of debate regarding many aspects of the farm bill; but, there is one issue that has received relatively little attention on the Senate floor, yet it is one of the most important matters facing our country. That issue is hunger, and it affects 1 in 10 U.S. households, including nearly 1 million of North Carolina's 8.8 million residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the farm bill we have just passed contains a number of provisions that will support efforts to help the hungry. Take for example, the Food Employment Empowerment and Development Act, or the FEED Act, which Senator Lautenberg and I have worked on together. I am very pleased that this measure has been included in the managers package. The FEED Act helps fight hunger by combining food rescue with job training, thus teaching unemployed and homeless adults the skills needed to  work in the food service industry. This provision will provide much-needed resources to community kitchens around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Successful FEED-type programs already exist. For example, in Charlotte,  NC, the Community Culinary School, which I visited last month, recruits students from social service agencies, homeless shelters, halfway houses and work release programs. Just around the corner from the U.S. Capitol, students are hard at work in the DC Central Kitchen's culinary job training class. This is a model program, which began in 1990, and it is always a privilege for me  to go over to the Kitchen and meet with folks who have faced great adversity but are now on track for a meaningful career. Earlier this year, I visited on their graduation day, and the graduates were so excited they were dancing in the kitchen. They were ready to start good jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, for the DC Central Kitchen, Charlotte Community Culinary School and other hunger relief organizations to carry out their mission, they must have food. To this end, I am very pleased that Senator Grassley and Senator Lugar have joined me as co-sponsors of my food donation amendment included in the managers package. My thanks to Chairman Baucus, and a special thank you to Ranking Member Grassley, as well as their staffs, for working with me in this  effort. My amendment addresses four tax issues that will encourage food donations and volunteering to help the hungry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, my amendment extends a provision from the Pension Protection Act that allows any taxpayer to claim an enhanced deduction for donations of food. This deduction is set to expire at the end of the year; my amendment extends it for 2 additional years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, my amendment allows restaurants to qualify for this deduction. Unfortunately, a drafting error excluded most restaurants from utilizing this deduction due to their tax structure. My amendment corrects this problem and provides restaurants with an extra incentive to donate food for hunger relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it simplifies the rules that allow farmers and ranchers to take advantage of this deduction for donating their products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, my amendment allows volunteers to receive a tax deduction for mileage incurred while transporting food donations. As a former President of the American Red Cross, I know first hand the importance of volunteers--there would be no Red Cross without the 1.3 million volunteers--and I understand that many charities, like Meals on Wheels, depend on volunteers using their personal vehicles to deliver food to countless tables across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, volunteers who glean and transport food could benefit from this tax deduction measure. Excess crops that would otherwise be plowed under or thrown out are taken from farms and other entities and distributed to the needy. In the Old Testament, in the book of Ruth, we learn that she gleaned in the fields so that her family could eat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year in this country, 96 billion pounds of good, nutritious food is left over or thrown away. Gleaning helps eliminate this waste. I have gleaned a number of times with an organization called the Society of St. Andrew, the latest being sweet potatoes in Harnett County, NC, in October.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have a number of concerns about the farm bill and its impact on North Carolina agriculture, I welcome this bill's hunger and nutrition focus. Especially at this beautiful season of giving and thanksgiving we should remember our 35 million fellow Americans who are struggling just to have enough to eat. The bill's provisions will help us keep up the fight in the battle against hunger. This is a campaign that cannot be won in months, or even a few years, but with a caring Government and  a caring people working together, ending hunger in America is certainly a victory within reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
