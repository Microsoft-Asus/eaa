    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate the Lansdowne Improvement Association on its 100th anniversary. Since April 1908, the association has served the Lansdowne community, a neighborhood that has a rich and interesting history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1800s, the Whitaker Iron Company began mining ore in the area and farms soon followed. Once the mining pits were abandoned, underground springs filled the pits creating small ponds and lakes. The area continued to grow and develop, particularly with the influence of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The B&amp;O Railroad opened the Coursey Station in what is now Lansdowne. The Coursey Station Senior Housing Center, a thriving mainstay of the community, is named for this station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the 20th century, the community continued its growth around Coursey Station. Lansdowne quickly became known as a B&amp;O town because many of its residents worked for the railroad. Many of its workers commuted to Baltimore City by train. This connection lasted until the 1960s when the B&amp;O railroad closed the station. To this day, Lansdowne remains a very close-knit community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lansdowne Improvement Association is an active and visible part of the community. It hosts monthly meetings that are well attended by the community. Working together to benefit the neighborhood, the Association sponsors the Citizens on Patrol program and a canned food drive, and it keeps residents informed about activities and concerns in the community.  The Lansdowne Police and Fire Departments have developed a strong relationship with the association  to ensure that residents are kept informed about crime and other safety issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, as part of the 100th anniversary celebration, the Lansdowne Improvement Association is bringing back the once-traditional Lansdowne Parade, featuring music and entertainment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to express my congratulations to the Lansdowne Improvement Association, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this important milestone for the Lansdowne community.</paragraph>
