    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the founding dean of the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Richard "Dick" Morgan. Dick came to Nevada to take on the daunting task of starting Nevada's first law school. When given the timeframe for starting the school, Dick said it could not be done; then he went out and proved himself wrong many times over. Dick's outstanding success with Boyd School of Law now serves as the model on how to create a new  law school of exceptional quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Dean's steady hand, Boyd Law School has achieved both provisional and full accreditation with the American Bar Association in record time. The school has received special recognition for its work with the Saltman Center for Conflict Resolution, the Nevada Law Journal, client counseling training, Society of Advocates, and legal writing programs. With amazing rapidity, the school has earned an outstanding reputation for scholarship and high-quality graduates. Already, the school's alumnae  are having a tremendous impact on the legal profession in Nevada. They serve as judicial clerks, pro bono attorneys, respected members of law firms throughout the State, legal counsel in Federal and State agencies, and even on my own staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 30, 2007, Dean Morgan is stepping down as the head of the law school. Although he will be sorely missed, his legacy is tremendous. UNLV's law school dean is leaving us with an outstanding institution that will continue to train the minds of many of our best and brightest students. I am confident that the attorneys trained by the school will be instrumental in guiding the future growth and progress of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he came to Nevada, he had served as a law professor and as dean of both the Wyoming and Arizona State Colleges of Law. Reflecting on his experience in legal education, Dean Morgan recently honored Nevada by characterizing his 10 years with Boyd School of Law as "the best" of his 27 years in legal education. I am grateful he spent his best years with us. He has certainly been invaluable to the Nevada legal community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Going forward, Dean Morgan plans a community-service semiretirement. Based on his dedication to UNLV, I am confident that he will be a tremendous asset to any organization he is associated with. I offer Dean Morgan my sincere thanks for all he has done for Nevada and wish him the best on his retirement.</paragraph>
