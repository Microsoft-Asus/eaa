  <narrative>FISA MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11757]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I found the comments of my friend from Maryland very interesting. I would just remind the Speaker and all who have looked on the vote today about the veto of SCHIP that when we passed the continuing resolution, we passed a continuation of SCHIP. So no children should be affected adversely during these weeks as we work to reach the compromise that the President has said he is working for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thought this should be called the "FISA Week," Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act Week. But now because of the actions of the majority, we were not able to vote on that  particular bill as it was presented to us earlier this week. We already knew we would be prohibited from offering any amendments, as the Rules Committee granted a closed rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let us call this the "FISA Month," since we now know there is consideration for bringing the FISA bill back next week and the importance of FISA, foreign intelligence surveillance, cannot be overestimated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Speaker of the House took the floor in the debate on the rule and, in a diplomatic or parliamentary tour de force, managed to contradict the United States Constitution, every decision made by the United States Supreme Court on this issue, and the decisions made by the appellate court of FISA, the FISA Courts. And that was when she suggested that the Constitution does not grant any inherent authority to the President to involve himself or direct, that is, foreign intelligence. As  a matter of fact, every Supreme Court decision since the beginning of the Republic has recognized that. With respect to exclusivity of the law, every Supreme Court decision has recognized that such a law cannot be exclusive, as does the FISA Court, the appellate court under the FISA structure itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly, however, when we do look at FISA, the bill that was brought forward to us as a result of a manager's amendment's being incorporated into the bill presented to us, it contains this language: This deals with the situation in which we have, everyone agrees, a constitutionally permitted wiretap or otherwise means of collecting communications between Osama bin Laden, a terrorist target in a foreign country, a foreigner in a foreign country. We have every right to gather that information  under the law. There's no disagreement. But here is what happens under the bill presented to us:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the electronic surveillance referred to in that paragraph dealing with what we presume to be foreign-to-foreign communications inadvertently collects a communication in which at least one party to the communication is located inside the United States or is a United States person, the contents of such communication shall be handled in accordance with minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General, and, now, this is the important language, "that require that no contents of any communication  to which a United States person is a party shall be disclosed, disseminated, or used for any purpose or retained for longer than 7 days unless a court order" is given, "or," further it says, "unless the Attorney General," and this requires him specifically, "determines that the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why is this unfortunate? It is unfortunate because it changes the way we handle minimization in the criminal justice context. If we have a legal wiretap on a mafioso member and he happens to call his sainted mother or a priest or someone else, and that, therefore, is someone who was not under the wiretap, you don't have to go back to a court to get another court order in order to use whatever he said, that is, the mafioso member, against his interest. And here we would say that if in this  conversation Osama bin Laden said something that didn't implicate the American but did give us information as to where Osama bin Laden was located or where Osama bin Laden was going to move, we would be prohibited from using that information, disclosing that information, disseminating that information, or keeping it for more than 7 days unless we went to a court for a new court order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is nonsense. That gives Osama bin Laden more protection than an American citizen in the United States who is being investigated for a criminal offense. That is nuts. Not only is it nuts, it is dangerous to the American people because it creates a situation in which we would be blinded about information which would give us an ability, first of all, to find out what the dots are and then to connect the dots as to what the threat is against the United States. There is no rationalization for  it, but it is part and parcel of what we have heard from the other side that we need to give now habeas corpus rights to those people we found on the battlefield around the world who are unlawful enemy combatants. It is part and parcel of a program that puts us at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask us to consider it seriously next week.</paragraph>
