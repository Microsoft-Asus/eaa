    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise for the third time this week to speak about Georgia's PeachCare crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Sunday, in just 2 days, PeachCare closes its doors to new enrollees. And if funding shortages continue, it will close its doors to all children next month. The collapse of PeachCare will leave hundreds of thousands of hardworking Georgia families unable to provide health care for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress and the State of Georgia cannot let this happen. I call on the Governor of Georgia to use available State funds, and there are some that are available, to reinstate new enrollment and to sustain this imperative program until Federal funding can be increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PeachCare provides health care for our most precious and most vulnerable population: our children. It simply must be saved.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
