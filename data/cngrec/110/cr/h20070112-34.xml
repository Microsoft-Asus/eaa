    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my mother taught for most of her adult life, and she used to say, One of the things I like about you, Louie, is that you are teachable. And I am learning, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have learned that you can make a promise for years and years: We are going to have the most open government; we know that legislation is better if there is opportunity to amend it and debate it, because 100 percent right doesn't lie in one person, so we are going to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whoops, we have a shot in being in the majority. What can we do? Oh, I know, we can make a different promise. Well, we are people of our word, so we promise we are not going to do any of that stuff for the first 100 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that is 4 days and 4 hours. Whoops, we want to keep violating our first promise, so, well, we are promising that 100 hours means the clock only runs when we have the ball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am learning.</paragraph>
