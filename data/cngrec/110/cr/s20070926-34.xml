  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="SERGEANT EDMUND J. JEFFERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to reflect on the life of SGT Edmund Jeffers, who died last Wednesday in a vehicle accident in Taqqadum, Iraq. Sergeant Jeffers served in the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. At the age of 23 he was on his second tour of duty in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eddie Jeffers grew up in Daleville, AL, just south of Fort Rucker. The son of a master sergeant, he learned the value of military service early in life. He enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2002 after his graduation, feeling the call of duty after the events of September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knew Sergeant Jeffers describe him as a man of conviction, principle, and faith. His Christian values, his father recounts, guided his work as a soldier. They strengthened his resolve to defeat those who commit evils against innocents, and they kept alive his hope for a future of freedom and security for Iraqis. He saw the threat of terrorism as the struggle of his generation, a long war that will require sacrifice and commitment from all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Jeffers, like so many soldiers before him, documented his experiences in war with pen and paper. He kept a journal in Iraq, posted updates for his friends and family online, and shared some of his writings with the world. He was eloquent and sharp. One of his essays, entitled "Hope Rides Alone," has circulated widely on the internet, and newspapers have reprinted portions in recent days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In, the essay, Eddie worried that the political debate at home was weakening our resolve to achieve success in Iraq and was driving a wedge between the country and the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He noted that this war is being fought on the backs of our men and women in uniform, while the "American people have not been asked to sacrifice anything. Unless you are in the military or the family member of a servicemember, it's life as usual ..... the war doesn't affect you. But it affects us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political debate here in Washington, Sergeant Jeffers argued, has become a national preoccupation that is distracting our focus from our goals in Iraq. As Sergeant Jeffers notes, there is strong disagreement in this country about the course we should take in Iraq. Our soldiers, too, have many different opinions. Much of this debate is necessary and healthy for a democracy, but, as Sergeant Jeffers cautions, the discussion should neither distract us from our efforts to protect national security  nor lessen our commitment to helping secure a better future for Iraqis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, Iraqis "want what everyone else wants in life: safety, security, somewhere to call home," Sergeant Jeffers wrote. "They want a country that is safe to raise their children in."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General MacArthur once said that it is "the soldier, above all other people, who prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest scars of war." This was true for Eddie. Amid the chaos and violence in Iraq, Sergeant Jeffers never lost sight of the simple aspirations and the basic humanity that bind the vast majority of Iraqis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admire Sergeant Jeffers' life and service, all the more for his courage to share his thoughts with the world. His writings are powerful and challenge us to better account for the costs of freedom and for the sacrifices that all Americans should be prepared to make on its behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One cannot adequately honor Eddie Jeffers' service and sacrifice. His actions need no praise to be commendable, and his writings stand alone with the force of his convictions. We are humbled by his life and saddened by his loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Eddie's wife Stephanie, and to his parents Tina and David, my thoughts and prayers are with you. I know of no words that can lessen the pain that you feel, but I hope that one day you will find comfort in knowing that Eddie's sacrifice will never be forgotten. He challenges us to do better by our soldiers, to never let "hope walk alone." His voice is heard, and his country is grateful. He will endure in our hearts and our prayers.</paragraph>
