  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate and extend my warmest aloha to Dr. Ramon Sy, who was selected as Hawaii's national recipient of the Jefferson Award. The Jefferson Award is a prestigious award recognizing and honoring individuals for their contributions to community and public service. Dr. Sy, through his Aloha Medical Mission, has helped to provide medical treatment to thousands of individuals in the Pacific and Asia, who are unable to access modern medical care due to cost or availability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of the Philippines, Dr. Sy and seven other members of the Philippine Medical Association of Hawaii established the Aloha Medical Mission in 1983. The Aloha Medical Mission provides voluntary medical, surgical, and other health-related services, which include the donation of supplies and equipment, to medically indigent areas of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In addition to providing access to health services, the Aloha Medical Mission also provides training to physicians overseas and  through an exchange fellowship program in Honolulu, HI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Sy is responsible for furthering the development of the Aloha Medical Mission from a small group of doctors to an organization well known within the international community. Since the establishment of the Aloha Medical Mission, Dr. Sy and his colleagues have served in 11 countries, treated 200,000 patients, and performed over 9,000 operations. His commitment to ensuring that medical care is accessible in both Hawaii and abroad demonstrates his compassion and undying concern for others. He  is an inspiration to all because of his willingness to embrace the problems of those less fortunate. I hope that many will aspire to follow Dr. Sy's example by making a commitment to making a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Dr. Sy for his dedication and quality efforts and extend the same gratitude to all the members of the Aloha Medical Mission. I wish Dr. Sy and his family the best in their future endeavors.</paragraph>
