  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="FIRST LIEUTENANT JACOB FRITZ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army 1LT Jacob Fritz of Nebraska. Lieutenant Fritz was killed near Karbala, Iraq on January 20. He was 25 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz was raised on his family's farm near Verdon, NE. From a young age, Lieutenant Fritz knew he wanted to be a leader. After graduating from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000, he followed through on this goal. I had the honor of nominating Lieutenant Fritz to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from the Academy in 2005. His brother, Daniel Fritz, 22, followed in his footsteps and is currently in his third year at West Point. Like his brother Jake, I had the privilege  of nominating Dan to West Point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz was leading a unit of more than 30 soldiers in Iraq since October. Lieutenant Fritz described his mission as a liaison between Iraqi police and the U.S. Army. He said the work was challenging, but rewarding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz was buried on January 31 with full military honors in a church cemetery 4 miles from his family home near Verdon, NE. Family and friends paid their final respects in a moving service that reminded all of the courage, commitment, and sacrifice of soldiers like Lieutenant Fritz. As his childhood friend Air Force 1LT Brett Cooper remembered, a life of service to his country followed by a retirement to the small town life that he loved was all that Lieutenant Fritz wanted. We're  proud of Lieutenant Fritz's service to our country as well as the service of thousands of brave Americans who are currently serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his brother Dan, Lieutenant Fritz is survived by his parents Lyle and Noala and his younger brother Ethan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring 1LT Jacob Fritz.</paragraph>
