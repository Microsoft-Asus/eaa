    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come down to the floor at the end of the week to just say if we really want to be sincere about bringing down the price of energy, we need to have an all-of-the-above strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is opening up the Outer Continental Shelf which we legislatively limited 25 years. That is bringing on wind and solar. We can use the revenues from opening the OCS to build wind and solar operations. We can use our vast resources of coal, 250 years worth of supply in the Illinois coal basin alone, turning that into liquid fuels creating American jobs. We also can continue to expand the use of biofuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great thing about the Republican proposal is that it is all of the above. We are not willing to say "no" to everything. We want everything to come on board, to bring on more supply and lower the cost of liquid fuel for the cost of electricity, and we want these fuels and these commodities to compete. In the competition, we will have lower-cost fuel and energy so we can have a manufacturing base left in the United States of America.</paragraph>
