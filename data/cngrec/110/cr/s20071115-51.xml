    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Okiciyapi Tipi for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat  for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects their hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role they have played in giving back to their local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Okiciyapi Tipi works with the Midwest Region Habitat for Humanity International. By creating new progressive partnerships with local banks, Okiciyapi Tipi has helped to facilitate tremendous rehabbing projects for the past two seasons. These projects have drawn volunteers from across the world. Jerry Farlee, executive director of Okiciyapi Tipi, has been nominated for a 3-year term on the U.S. Advisory Council for Habitat for Humanity International in order to further support the goals of the  affiliates servicing rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Okiciyapi Tipi and to congratulate them on receiving this well-earned award and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
