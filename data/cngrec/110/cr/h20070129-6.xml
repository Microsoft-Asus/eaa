  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend I participated in the American University in Bulgaria's Board of Trustees meetings. I am honored to serve on the board which promotes world-class education for students throughout Eastern Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This September marks the university's 16th year. The first American-style undergraduate liberal arts educational institution in Eastern Europe, AUBG has more than quadrupled in size since its opening. University President Michael Easton, Provost Ann Ferren, and Chairman of the Board David Glanagan are to be commended for their dedication to AUBG and their vision for its future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the people of Bulgaria continue their democratic transformation, AUBG's mission statement best exemplifies the institution's commitment to Bulgaria's prosperity, The mission of the American University in Bulgaria is to educate future leaders committed to serving the needs of the region by promoting the values of an open, democratic society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="FATHER ROBERT DRINAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Robert Drinan, or Father Robert Drinan as he was always known, the only priest to serve in the House of Representatives. He was the colleague of many who are still in the House. He was my own colleague at Georgetown Law School where he served on the faculty after he left the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Drinan, while he was in Congress, wore his priestly garb because he always considered himself a priest, but when asked why he did not put on civilian clothes, he said, "It's the only clothes I have." And they were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He bowed to the discipline of his church when the ruling came down that priests should not serve in a legislative body. He took many of the concerns he had brought to this floor with him into books and studies, particularly in the field of international human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am beginning work on a resolution in honor of Father Drinan. He has already been honored by this House with the Congressional Distinguished Service Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to be on a retreat on Thursday. I hope that we can make some arrangements so that many of us who would want to attend the funeral on Thursday may do that and then go to the retreat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will save further remarks for such time as a resolution or other fitting period of memorial for Father Drinan is offered here on the House floor.</paragraph>
