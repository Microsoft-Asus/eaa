    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the last 2 weeks have been a time of sorrow for me, and a time of pride also. I was awakened at 2:00 in the morning to learn that my good friend, President Ford, had passed away. And the succeeding whirlwind of funerals, receptions, and events dealing with his death have reminded us all how much he gave our country and how much he did for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to call Mr. Ford a friend. I am proud of what he did for our country. I am proud that he so ably reflected the values and virtues of west Michigan, my part of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We pray that You will bless Betty and his family and give them comfort and give them strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will shortly be presenting a resolution honoring President Ford, and I hope that Members will find their way to the floor to speak on this special resolution, or speak later this evening. I encourage them to join me in honoring this great American and wonderful President.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
