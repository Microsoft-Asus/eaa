  <narrative>NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING AND SELF-DETERMINATION ACT -- (Senate - February 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="845">S845</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the Banking Committee's action on <bill type="s" number="2062">S. 2062</bill>, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2007. Senator Shelby and I agreed to discharge this bill from the Banking Committee, with an amendment, to help move the bill along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reauthorizes the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act, NAHASDA, which provides critical funds for housing Native Americans who suffer significant and unique housing problems. According to HUD data, almost one-third of Native Americans have severe housing burdens. They live in overcrowded conditions, lack basic plumbing and utilities, or pay over half of their income for their housing costs. NAHASDA is the primary way that Indian tribes are assisted in addressing  these critical housing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment drafted by Senator Shelby and I includes a provision to clarify that this bill should not interfere with ongoing court cases regarding funding allocations. I want to acknowledge the contributions of Senators Tester and Enzi in working on this provision. In addition, the amendment helps to retain the requirements that funds be used for those Native Americans in the worst housing situations and that funds continue to be used to increase affordable housing  opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues to quickly pass <bill type="s" number="2062">S. 2062</bill> as amended.</paragraph>
