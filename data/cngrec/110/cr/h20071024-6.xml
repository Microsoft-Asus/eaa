  <narrative>VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11937]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week on ABC's news program, Charlie Gibson announced the news in Iraq. He said, "The news is, there isn't any news." That's right. Across all of Iraq, there were no fatalities, shootings and bombs going off. As the media has started to recognize that we have turned the corner and are winning the war in Iraq, this pressing question, once again, comes before the House, and that is, what are the Democrats going to do with the bill that we have already passed and that  the Senate has already passed to provide money for our veterans?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighteen million dollars every day is being wasted for the last 130 days because we won't bring this veterans funding bill back for final approval. It has the votes. What are we waiting for, post-traumatic stress syndrome? Veterans hospitals? Veterans clinics? We have to ask the Democrat leadership why a 130-day wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for us to fund our veterans.</paragraph>
