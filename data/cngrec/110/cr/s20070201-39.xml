    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the life of Barbaro, the 2006 Kentucky Derby Champion. He was an inspirational survivor and was beloved by the State of Kentucky. Barbaro's motivational rise to the top of horse racing history and relentless fight for his life against all odds, serves as a shining example of strength and courage to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbaro first entered this world on April 29, 2003, when he was foaled in Nicholasville, KY, at Springmint Farm. He is the son of the great champion racehorse Dynaformer and was destined to be a champion from the beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbaro was always a favorite of the crowd, but it was his performance at the Kentucky Derby, May 6, 2006, that would make him a legend. He ended up winning the Derby with a lead of seven lengths, which was the largest margin of victory since 1946. Because of this spectacular race, many people believed Barbaro was destined for greatness in the horse racing industry and favored him to go on to win the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later that same year, Barbaro ran the Preakness Stakes on May 20, 2006, as the crowd favorite. After an initial false start through the starting gate and signs of distress early on in the race, it was clear that Barbaro had sustained a severe injury. Laboratory tests showed that he had fractured three bones in and around his ankle and right hind leg. This resulted in immediate surgery and many subsequent  surgeries. A last effort was made by doctors to  save Barbaro, but their continued efforts proved to be unsuccessful and caused his current ailments to spread farther through his body. Although he kept fighting to recover, it was clear to everyone that he was in monumental pain. On January 29, 2007, Barbaro's owners decided that his pain was too much to handle and he was laid to rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbaro had a unique, motivational quality that made him the object of care and affection from the public in a way that few animals before him have ever experienced. He will be terribly missed but never forgotten. Barbaro was a champion, a fighter, and a true inspiration to the entire State of Kentucky.</paragraph>
