    <paragraph>Madam President, summer will not officially begin until June 21, but already the summer heat and thunderstorms are upon us. Lawns are lush and green, calling for the mower at least every week to maintain their carefully manicured appearance. Gardens are bursting with blooms that hold the promise of juicy red tomatoes, crisp green peppers, and a never-ending supply of zucchini. Along rural roadsides, great rafts of daylilies growing are beginning to bloom in waves of firecracker orange  starbursts above the dense green foliage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the lawn and garden chores that beg for attention, one day this weekend was reserved for pleasure. Sunday, June 15, was Father's Day. Across the Nation, ties disappeared from store shelves, golf paraphernalia was snapped up, funny cards were bought, and restaurant reservations were made. On Sunday, many fathers were encouraged to take a break, to enjoy a brunch buffet, and to open some of the classic father's day gifts--those ties, golf tees, or cologne. This week, men across the Nation  will sport brightly hued new ties and exotic scents that wordlessly label them as proud fathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fatherhood is a wonderful experience but also a nerve-wracking one. It is full of high points, from passing on new skills and old interests to a new generation, to witnessing the achievements of our offspring as they achieve success on their own. The sight of large father's hands tenderly cradling a tiny morsel of newborn humanity is enough to melt the hardest heart. But it is also a frightening responsibility, knowing that one's every word and action, for better or for worse, is being absorbed  into the creation of a new character. Fathers who praise their child's hard work and perseverance in the face of setbacks, or who demonstrate the high value they place on being a good sport, build strong, resilient children who learn to work well with others throughout their lives. Fathers who lose</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fathers typically spend fewer hours in the company of their children than do their mothers. Therefore, each hour spent together is precious, a fact that can be difficult to remember when fathers come home from work tired, and that lawn still needs to be mowed or those bills need to be paid. But in the years to come, as children grow, it is the time spent playing catch, or building a doghouse, or even watching a football game together, that both father and child will remember and cherish--not  that the lawn was properly edged and raked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the times spent with my Dad that I remember most fondly were just those few quiet minutes that we spent together most days, when I would meet Dad walking home from work. He would share with me a little cake that he had saved from his lunch, and we would talk and walk together.  No matter how tired he was, he was interested in how my day had gone and what I had learned in school. Like many kids, I worked hard at school and at my other activities,  from my daily chores to playing my fiddle, to earn the reward of his smile and his words of praise. That ability to inspire a child is the greatest power, and the greatest responsibility, of fatherhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The creation of Father's Day is widely credited to Mrs. Sonora Dodd, who, inspired by the idea of Mother's Day, chose to honor the father who raised her and her siblings after their mother died. Her father, William Smart, must have been a great father, to have sparked such a tribute from his daughter. As we honor the contributions to our families made by our fathers, we must also thank Sonora Dodd for her devotion and dedication to her father and all fathers. Mr. Smart did not know the German  writer Jean Paul Richter 1762-1825, but he proved the truth behind Richter's observation that "The words that a father speaks to his children in the privacy of home are not heard by the world, but, as in whispering galleries, they are heard clearly at the end and by posterity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I close with a poem by an anonymous author, titled "A Little Chap Who Follows Me." My Dad knew the truth of this poem, and I learned the truth of it after my own daughters were born, as all fathers do. On Father's Day, as fathers are being honored, it reminds us of the qualities of a father that are most worth honoring.</paragraph>
