  <narrative>OVERRIDING THE WRDA VETO -- (Senate - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14109">S14109</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to touch on another subject that is terribly important to the State of Florida. It has to do with the Water Resources Development Act which for a long time has been pending before the Congress, and which is so long overdue. When this matter comes to a vote, I will vote to override the President's veto, primarily because in this bill there is nearly $2 billion for the long overdue and critically important work of restoring Florida's Everglades. This is a bipartisan  project. This is a project of unique cooperation between the State and Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of Florida's Everglades is fascinating. About 100 years ago it was decided that man could conquer all and, in fact, the Army Corps of Engineers should endeavor, through many projects, to drain the Everglades so they could be utilized for farming and that the water would be moved out. So a series of canals was dug and all sorts of efforts were put in place to drain the swamp, to drain the Everglades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we find ourselves a century later understanding that these well-intended Floridians of those days were terribly misguided. The Everglades is a jewel to the State of Florida; it is a jewel to the Nation. It is an environmental masterpiece, the wildlife, between the plants and animal life, but also it is an essential water resource for the people of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some years ago, under the leadership of my predecessor in office, Senator Graham, who had been Governor of Florida, and many other Floridians, working in partnership with Governor Bush and later when Senator Nelson came to the Senate, along with Florida's Governor, they crafted this Everglades Restoration Program. For 5 years this bill has been delayed. It has meant delaying substantial Federal involvement in a multitude of necessary projects, including the Comprehensive Everglades  Restoration Plan. It is the funding that has been missing. The State has done its part. The Federal Government has, so far, been absent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with the President and the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire that this bill lacks fiscal discipline. It seeks to spend too much on programs that have little need or reason for Federal support. But I also have to recognize that the longer we wait for the Federal Government to meet its Everglades commitment, the more expensive the cost and the more damage that will be irreversible to this fantastic ecosystem. In the past 5 years the cost of the Indian River</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lagoon project alone has increased by more than $100 million. Seven years ago, the State of Florida and the Federal Government entered into an agreement:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>to restore, preserve and protect the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region. ..... &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, the State of Florida has invested more than $3 billion in this effort; but the Federal Government, originally intended to be an equal partner in the restoration, has yet to meet its obligations--spending only a fraction of Florida's investments on preplanning efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Everglades belong to Florida, but they are a national treasure. The Federal Government has committed to restore the Everglades and it is high time they follow through on this commitment. What exists today is more than 2 million protected acres of what was once deemed worthless swampland slated for development. Indeed, development did occur and road construction has almost irreversibly impeded the natural cleansing flows of the Everglades. But because of the work of the State of Florida and  numerous environmental organizations, we are reversing the damage of development. Once on a path to destruction, the Everglades now teems with wildlife, endangered and rare species, and contributes greatly to south Florida's environmental health. But the work is far from complete. A substantial portion of the work lies ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No single bill Congress approves will have as much positive impact on Florida's environment as this one. It is, in fact, more than an environmental project. It is also a water project. Over the last several weeks, we have been hearing reports about the scarcity of water around Atlanta, where several million Americans reside. It has come to the point that Florida, Georgia, and Alabama had to have a serious conversation with the Department of Interior about water flows from the river that flows  from Georgia all the way into Alabama and Florida. In Florida it is the Chattahoochee River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The serious nature of that problem can also be reconciled with the serious problem we would see in south Florida if our water supply were impeded. This is not only an environmental project, it is also a water resources project. It is about the water that is necessary to sustain life and to sustain the people, the several million people who live in south Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it would be a very important moment for us to override the veto, to move forward with the Everglades Restoration, the Indian River Lagoon, the Picayune Strand--these are very important projects--and a score of other projects around the State of Florida, all related to our environment that is such an important part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration. But more than that, it is part of Florida's future and part of the legacy we leave our children.</paragraph>
