    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is the 40th anniversary of Special Olympics, an organization that has touched the lives of people with intellectual disabilities in Nevada and throughout the country. This spring, I had the chance to meet with one such Special Olympics athlete: Cari Davis, a resident of Henderson, NV, who has been winning medals since beginning her athletic career in 1988. It is my privilege today to recognize the achievements of all Special Olympics athletes, as well as the  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="6929">S6929</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty years ago, Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded Special Olympics with the belief that everyone, regardless of ability or disability, deserves opportunities to participate in sports. What began as Camp Shriver on the lawn of her Maryland home has now grown into an international organization reaching over 180 countries. Through these programs, people with intellectual disabilities can do more than just develop skills in a particular sport or improve their physical fitness. They also get opportunities  to form friendships, build self-confidence, learn teamwork, and enjoy the sheer joy of the athletic experience. That is why I was pleased to help enact the Healthy Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004, which enabled Special Olympics to expand its programs and increase the number of athletes served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State, Special Olympics Nevada provides year-round training and competition opportunities in a variety of sports, including alpine skiing, basketball, swimming, and gymnastics. In addition to providing these activities and sponsoring competitive trials, Special Olympics offers services that promote good health, such as screenings through the Healthy Athletes Program. Larger events are also held, like the Special Olympics Nevada Summer Games that took place this June in Reno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These events highlight more than the athletes' determination, talents, and spirit. Their participation in sports is also serving to dispel myths and change attitudes, contributing to the greater inclusion, understanding, and acceptance of people with disabilities. In fact, there are Special Olympics initiatives, like its collaboration with the school district in Clark County, NV, that give students with intellectual disabilities and other students the chance to participate in sports together.  Perhaps it is these young athletes who best embody this remark by Mrs. Shriver: "May you overturn ignorance; may you challenge indifference at every turn; and may you find great joy in the new daylight of the great athletes of the Special Olympics."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish Special Olympics all the best as we celebrate its 40th anniversary and look forward to many more years to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Special Olympics, an organization that has done an extraordinary job of improving the lives of individuals with intellectual disabilities. This remarkable organization was born in Eunice Kennedy Shriver's backyard, where she used to host a day camp for children with intellectual disabilities. Under her founding leadership--and for the last decade, under the leadership of her son, Tim Shriver--the Special Olympics  has grown into a truly amazing enterprise, serving some 2.5 million people in more than 180 countries. It gives individuals with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to improve their health, well-being, social skills, and other skills through competitive sports--and the opportunity to have fun, just like everyone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been a long-time advocate for people with disabilities. But it was not until the 1980s, when Eunice Kennedy Shriver came to see me and asked me to get involved as an advocate for individuals with intellectual disabilities, that I learned about the unique challenges faced by individuals with intellectual disabilities in our society. Of course, when Eunice Kennedy Shriver asked, I couldn't say no. She invited me to a Special Olympics competition here in Washington, and I immediately became  a fan. It was extraordinary to see the athletes' talents, enthusiasm, and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, thanks largely to Special Olympics, I have developed a better appreciation of the needs of people with intellectual disabilities. They have health problems that many physicians do not know how to address. For example, by and large, individuals with intellectual disabilities have little opportunity for exercise and other physical activity. Too often, they are relegated to the fringes of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The brilliance of the Special Olympics is that it uses sports to help integrate people with intellectual disabilities into our broader society. Special Olympics provides a kind of ideal world for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The accent is on abilities, not disabilities. Athletes have the opportunity to compete and achieve on a level playing field. Special Olympics gives its athletes, like Kyler Prunty, one of my constituents from Marshalltown, IA, the opportunity to compete in  swimming and other sports, as all children and young adults want the opportunity to do. Kyler knows that his success is determined by his own hard work, talent, determination, and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics helps people overcome their fear and ignorance of individuals with intellectual disabilities. It transforms athletes by empowering them as competitors and leaders. It transforms communities by changing attitudes about people with intellectual disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics includes a number of associated programs. The Unified Sports program provides inclusive sports experiences with individuals with and without intellectual disabilities playing together on the same team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics also improves the lives of individuals with disabilities by looking at health issues. I am a proud supporter of the Healthy Athletes program, which allows athletes to receive a variety of important health screenings and services in conjunction with local, State/Provincial, National, and World Games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics has come a long way since it began 40 years ago. When Special Olympics held its first event in Illinois, my home State of Iowa sent fewer than 100 athletes to the games. Today, more than 13,000 Special Olympics Athletes, and 2,000 certified coaches, from all 99 Iowa counties in Iowa, participate in Special Olympics programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that, in 2006, the first-ever Special Olympics USA National Games were held in Ames, IA. In conjunction with those games, I held a field hearing of my Senate Appropriations Subcommittee focusing on the status of people with intellectual disabilities in the U.S. That hearing taught us a great deal about the health and education needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of the hearing, I introduced <bill type="s" number="1050">S. 1050</bill>, the Health and Wellness for Individuals with Disabilities Act. This bill would promote the training of medical and dental professionals to care for individuals with intellectual disabilities. In addition, it would create model wellness programs, and standards for accessibility of medical equipment to further level the playing field for the care of Special Olympics athletes and other individuals with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics and its emphasis on inclusion of individuals with intellectual disabilities through athletics is now a worldwide movement. It shows what can be achieved when one individual, in the person of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, pursues a cause with passion. Her vision is making a difference in the fabric of our society, where individuals with intellectual disabilities can now participate in sports competitions in Iowa, across the country, and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute the Special Olympics for a brilliant 40 years of service, and I wish the organization even greater success in the decades ahead.</paragraph>
