  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, under current law, military pay rates must be reasonably comparable to those in the private sector with similar skills, education, and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints over the years, the military pay increase has not always met this criteria and a "pay gap" was created. This gap is not only unfair to our brave men and women in uniform. It also has raised retention and readiness concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, I have introduced <bill type="h" number="2027">H.R. 2027</bill>, the Military Pay Improvement Act, which would give them a minimum 3.5 percent pay raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's brave men and women in uniform have fought gallantly to ensure the continued safety, security, and prosperity of this great Nation. I believe it is unacceptable that we task these men and women with extraordinary responsibilities especially, during wartime, and cannot compensate them accordingly. The debt we owe them for their sacrifices can never be repaid. However, my bill will take a small step in the right direction to show our appreciation for their valor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
