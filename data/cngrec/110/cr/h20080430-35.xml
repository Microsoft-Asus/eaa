    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats know that middle class families are struggling to make ends meet in an economy that is simply leaving too many of them behind. That is why we worked in a bipartisan way to pass an economic stimulus plan earlier this year. And starting this week, more than 130 million Americans will receive some much-needed relief in the form of recovery rebate checks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good start, but more needs to be done. Once again, this Democratic-led Congress is reaching out in a bipartisan way to develop consensus for a second round of economic recovery legislation. We believe that a second economic stimulus plan is needed as the bleak news around the economy continues to mount and Americans everywhere are feeling the negative impact of President Bush's economic policies. Unfortunately, the President has said that a second economic stimulus package is not necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President is incorrect. The congressional Democrats hope the President will reconsider so that we can work in a bipartisan fashion to get this economy back on track, create jobs, and speed up assistance to middle class families.</paragraph>
