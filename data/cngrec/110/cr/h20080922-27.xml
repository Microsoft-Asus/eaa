    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3299">H.R. 3299</bill>, introduced by Representative Musgrave from Colorado, would provide for a boundary adjustment in land conveyances involving the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado to correct the effects of an erroneous land survey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill responds to an ongoing boundary dispute between the Forest Service and private land owners with property adjacent to the forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have no objections to <bill type="h" number="3299">H.R. 3299</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I wish to congratulate Congresswoman Musgrave on this bill. <bill type="h" number="3299">H.R. 3299</bill> provides a legislative solution for a number of homeowners in Larimer County, Colorado, who own real property adjacent to the Roosevelt National Forest and have occupied or improved their property in good faith and in reliance on 1975 land surveys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent forest resurvey now claims that a small portion of the Roosevelt National Forest is occupied by these adjacent land owners. This bill conveys approximately seven acres occupied by the affected landowners to those landowners and is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I again urge all Members to support this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3299">H.R. 3299</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "A bill to provide for a boundary adjustment and land conveyances involving Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado, to correct the effects of an erroneous land survey that resulted in approximately 7 acres of the Crystal Lakes Subdivision, Ninth Filing, encroaching on National Forest System land, and for other purposes.".</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
