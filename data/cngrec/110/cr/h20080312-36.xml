    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of <bill type="hr" number="953">H. Res. 953</bill> honoring the service and sacrifice of the members of the United States Armed Forces, both at home and abroad, as well as their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day we have servicemembers who volunteer to serve in harm's way. They have volunteered to serve our great country and protect its citizens from threats to liberty and our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, by God's grace, our Nation now celebrates 232 years of freedom this year, and it is due to the service and sacrifices that have been made throughout our history by the men and women of this country who have served in its military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This evening, it is no different. Just like in the past when young men and women stepped forward to serve, they continue to do so. However, the difference now of course is our Nation is at war. And today, these men and women are joining the military knowing they will be headed overseas, knowing they will be put in harm's way, knowing that they will be sent away from their families and their loved ones and their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It takes tremendous courage, Mr. Speaker, and intestinal fortitude to come forward and wear the uniform, especially in today's environment where we are fighting conflicts literally all around the world. I have spent time with many of our men and women in uniform, both at home and abroad, in many different countries and on different continents, and I have seen it in their eyes and heard it from the deepest part of their hearts as they have expressed their commitment, as I have seen their courage,  and I have understood their conviction to serve our country and to honor it, putting their very lives on the line. Their unselfish service and their sacrifice is quite evident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it is our active duty personnel who have heard the call to duty or our Reserve component members who are our citizen soldiers who stand up to be counted to go out and serve and defend our values and freedom whenever called upon, we all are so appreciative of the service that our men and women in uniform give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we realize it is not just the servicemembers themselves, but also their families who are making sacrifices. The parents, the spouses, the children who go many months, a year, and sometimes even longer without seeing their loved ones. It is they who are constantly concerned, and have to go about life here without their son or daughter or husband or wife or mother or father or brother or sister. It is they who also sacrifice for this great country by yielding up a family member to go and serve  on behalf of all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it is missing the birth of a child or the first steps of a newborn, whether it is watching their child in a  baseball game, as we approach the spring of the year, or missing a birthday or an anniversary, these are times that we know our families always cherish and that families are sacrificing, to give up, in order to allow their loved ones to go and serve our country and protect all of our citizens so that all of us, from whatever background,  whatever calling we may be answering in life, have the freedom to go about our daily lives and the businesses and other events in which we are involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our servicemembers are defending freedom and democracy around the world, and they are playing a vital role in protecting the safety and security of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This moment of silence this resolution puts forth will take place on March 26, 2008, to celebrate the National Support Our Troops Day. It is just a small way that we as Americans can all show our pride and thanks for the many sacrifices made by our servicemembers and their families both at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although words are not enough to show how truly grateful we are to these families and to those in harm's way, it is one way that we can say thank you. It is one way we can say Godspeed. It is one way that we can show that we are praying for their safety and for their guidance and their wisdom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you, as a member of the Armed Services Committee and as one who serves on the Subcommittee on Air and Land Forces and also on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, how indeed we truly do respect and are grateful for our troops and what they are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one who also represents a district that is sandwiched between Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune, which is the home of many Reservists as well as National Guardsmen, we are very, very grateful for the service of all of those who are going forth on behalf of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to an issue very dear to me and very important to our Nation. In this country, we use holidays to remember the heroes of our past. We have among them Memorial Day, Veteran's Day, Columbus Day, Martin Luther King Day, and President's Day. These are fitting tributes for worthy heroes, but what of today's living heroes, our brave men and women on the front lines fighting in defense of our freedom?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that they, too, deserve special recognition and praise. Our very ability to assemble here today is a direct result of their actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago, a young constituent of mine, Alexandra McGregor, presented me with the idea of a "National Support the Troops Day." Alexandra had seen a news account of a fallen soldier, and she had the idea that we should set aside a day to honor our great American heroes fighting on the front lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I couldn't agree with her more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, as I have before, because of Alexandra and others like her who believe we should and we must show our appreciation for the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution calls for Americans to participate in a moment of silence on March 26 to recognize all of our active duty troops. Alexandra chose this date for a very personal reason. It is the birth date of her grandfather, a World War II veteran who helped instill in her such a deep love of country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add, Alexandra was just 16 years old. To this day, I'm moved to think that someone so young could have her priorities so straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She put in a considerable amount of time and personal effort to see her idea become a reality. She went as far as to call a high school in each and every State to convince them of the importance of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such dedication only serves to underscore the very reason for that resolution. American families strongly support our troops, and while so many of them fight abroad on our behalf, we should do everything we can to show our appreciation and thanks. I hope you will all join with me in support of this resolution and in support of the more than 1.5 million active duty troops who defend our freedoms each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my thanks to Mr. Knollenberg for his gracious comments.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="953">H. Res. 953</bill> "Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that all Americans should participate in a moment of silence to reflect upon the service and sacrifice of members of the United States Armed Forces both at home and abroad," introduced by my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Representative Joe Knollenberg. This praiseworthy legislation will honor the lives, the work, and the memory of the countless  men and women who everyday sacrifice their lives for our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our great Nation officially celebrates and honors the accomplishments and sacrifices of veterans, patriots, and leaders who fought for freedom, but does not yet officially pay tribute to those who currently serve in the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, I praise those individuals who currently continue to accept the challenges posed by fighting for our liberty. Let us look to the sky to honor the memory of these heroes who give their lives for the foundations of our democracy. These individuals represent the best in all of us and it is in their memory that we should devote ourselves to continuing what they began. By humbling ourselves and reserving a moment of silence, we give reverence and recognition for those who make the ultimate  sacrifice. Everyday, the men and women of our Armed Forces commence on a risky journey that many brave ones travel. In passing this important legislation, we effectively recall the purpose for which our elite Armed Forces are so dedicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are currently more than 1,500,000 active and reserve component members of the Armed Forces serving the United States in support and defense of the values and freedom that all Americans cherish. Our Nation's brave men and women in uniform are willing to give the ultimate sacrifice in order to ensure the freedoms enjoyed by every American remain intact. The debt we owe our Nation's armed services cannot be quantified, the respect and admiration felt by all Americans hardly expressed;  it is imperative that we show the men and women who offer their lives each day to protect our own just how much their courage means to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, words cannot convey or adequately repay the debt that is owed. We cannot sufficiently articulate the feelings of sorrow that are universally felt; however, we can pay those men and women of the Armed Forces no greater tribute than to honor their sacrifice with a moment of silence. The service that these brave individuals provide is priceless and will never go unrecognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, and, in so doing, giving our men and women in uniform the respect and recognition they deserve.</paragraph>
