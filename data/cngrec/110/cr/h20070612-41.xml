    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Barton College Bulldogs for their win in the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II Men's Basketball Tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 24, 2007, Barton College won the NCAA Division II Elite Eight Tournament by defeating the defending champions, Winona State University of Rochester, Minnesota. College basketball fans, student athletes, and the general public were treated to an exciting national championship game with one of the greatest rallies in Elite Eight Tournament history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barton College had an extraordinary year. The team won all nine of its overtime games, an NCAA Division II record. The team also had a season record of 31-5 and won their last 21 games, which is a school record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to Head Coach Ron Lievense, Athletic Director Gary Hall, Barton College President Dr. Norval Kneten, and Barton's student athletes for winning the national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my congratulations to Winona State University of Rochester, Minnesota, on an excellent season. Winona State finished their season with only one loss, which happened to be the national championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the national championship in such a courageous fashion has brought attention to the outstanding athletic program at Barton College. I know the fans of the university will remember this very special moment for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in passing House Resolution 329, congratulating the Barton College men's basketball team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Democratic side and the Republican side and my dear friend, Mr. Butterfield, for bringing this resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my friend, Congressman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, and many of my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="329">H. Res. 329</bill>, a resolution to congratulate the Barton College men's basketball team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division II men's basketball national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years ago, I attended Atlantic Christian College, which changed its name to Barton College in 1990. Mr. Speaker, I, like many of my colleagues in Congress, have had the fortunate opportunity of playing on a championship team. More than 40 years later, I can still vividly recall in my mind the wonderful memory of the night my prep school basketball team at Hargrave Military Academy won the military league championship. No matter what level, winning a championship is something an individual will  remember all of his or her life. My prep school basketball team claimed its championship with a final score of 81-79, so I know the firsthand experience of a close game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How exciting it was to see Barton College basketball make a miraculous comeback from seven points behind in the final 40 seconds to defeat Winona State University of Rochester, Minnesota, an undefeated team and last year's Division II champion, by a score of 77-75. Senior All-American point guard Anthony Atkinson scored the Bulldogs' final 10 points, including a layup at the buzzer; but I am sure that Anthony Atkinson would tell you that the win was a team effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In David and Goliath fashion, Barton College, a school with just 1,000 students, defeated teams during the Elite Eight from schools with much larger student bodies, Grand Valley State, Michigan, 23,000 students; Cal State San Bernardino, 17,000 students; and Winona State University, 8,000 students, to claim the school's first NCAA championship in any sport. Again, a student body of 1,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The team's confidence and calm under pressure helped it play and win nine overtime games during the 2006/2007 season to finish the season 31-5 and break a school record by winning its last 21 games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barton College is located in Congressman Butterfield's district, yet I share part of the county with Congressman Butterfield. I join him in congratulating the coaches and all the members of the 2006/2007 Barton College men's basketball team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I will submit for the Record the names of the coaches and the players.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ron Lievense (head), Joel Zimmerman, John Skinner, Mark Pounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sam Pounds, Jerrett Eason, Brandon Barton, Isaiah Cromwell, Errol Frails, Anthony Atkinson, Bobby Buffaloe, Spenser Briggs, Jeff Dalce, Brandon Raffel, Travis Johnson, Charles Gamble, Darrius Lee, Bobby McNeil, Brian Leggett, Alejo Barovero, David King, Mark Friscone, L.J. Dunn, Mike Flowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Barton College is proud of its college basketball history. Now, Barton College is part of North Carolina's rich basketball heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close by asking my colleagues to support this resolution. And I again congratulate the Barton College Bulldogs for this great victory.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="PLAYERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the gentleman from Illinois for giving me this time to speak on this resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my friend, Congressman Walter Jones, and me in recognizing and congratulating this year's NCAA Division II men's college basketball champions from my hometown of Wilson, North Carolina, Barton College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congressman Jones said a moment ago, he and I share Wilson County. And the campus is technically in my district, even though we both legitimately hold claim to that great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one of the most exciting basketball games that I have ever seen in my life, Mr. Speaker, the Barton College Bulldogs captured its first national title after senior guard Anthony Atkinson scored his team's final 10 points, including a layup at the buzzer, to rally Barton from a 74-67 deficit with just 45 seconds remaining. The improbable come-from-behind 77-75 victory was against a previously undefeated and defending national champion, Winona State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the game capped a tournament full of last-second heroics for Barton College, as they won the semifinal game by one point on a last-second freethrow, and the quarterfinal  game on a buzzer-beating overtime three-pointer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tournament followed an equally exciting 31-5 season in which Barton College became the first team in the history of the NCAA basketball to win four consecutive overtime games. Throughout the tournament and the season, the team showed heart, toughness and tenacity and determination by finding ways to win no matter what the circumstances were. They have had tremendous and deserved support from a community that is so proud of this college and this team. As I was leaving Wilson yesterday, I stopped  by the BB&amp;T branch on West 9th Street and there was a large banner in front of the bank congratulating the Bulldogs. We are so proud of this team, and we want our Nation to know of our proud feeling for this team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great honor, therefore, Mr. Speaker, for me to recognize the success, efforts and achievements of these outstanding young student athletes, and their head coach, a great individual, Ron Lievense, and his staff. Their hard work and dedication to team work is something that we are all proud of in Wilson County and northeastern North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in paying tribute to the Barton College basketball team.</paragraph>
