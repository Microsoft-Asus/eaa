    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues talk about the great activity in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had great activity in the House before. You didn't have a do-nothing Congress last year. You had a do-nothing Senate. And you're going to have a do-nothing Senate again this year. You're going to stack up all your bills and you're going to be waiting just like we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other outrage that is happening is there is a bill, <bill type="h" number="1294">H.R. 1294</bill>, that is going to recognize six Indian tribes, bypass the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corruption is alive and well in this place again because that's what we did a few years ago. We stopped it. There is a process that should be followed. Go before the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do we know what's a tribe? How do we know if there's economic, social, and political continuity of these tribes precolonial time?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats are bringing back a corrupt practice. I urge you to pay attention to this.</paragraph>
