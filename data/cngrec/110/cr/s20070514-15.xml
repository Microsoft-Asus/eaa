    <paragraph>Madam President, on April 13, 2007, Idaho grieved at the passing of one of her great men, Claud R. Judd. Claud lived most all of his life in Fraser, ID, and left behind his wife Elvita, 2 sisters, 3 sons, 1 daughter, 12 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. A lifelong farmer, Claud is perhaps best known to Idahoans for his many years of public service. From local cemetery, park, school, hospital and county fair boards to Clearwater County commissioner and member of the Idaho  State Legislature in both houses, he exemplified public service. His legacy is a model of civic duty and commitment to family and community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claud found the time in his busy schedule to write a book about his family, and compile a scrapbook about the Clearwater County Extension and 4-H spanning seven decades. He was a hard, honest worker, and committed himself fully to whatever endeavor he undertook. I had the honor and privilege of serving in the Idaho State Legislature with Claud. Fellow lawmakers and staff could always count on him to be honest, kind and thorough. Claud was known as a consensus-builder who put the needs of his  constituents first. He focused on results and was known to care little for the politics that cause party line divisions. He represented the Idahoans of Clearwater County with integrity and common sense, reflecting his deep Idaho agriculture roots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife and I join other Idahoans in mourning this great loss to our State, and we offer our most sincere condolences to Elvita and the family.</paragraph>
