    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a team of courageous student athletes from Portsmouth, Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Sunday, October 28, the Shawnee State University men's soccer team, fresh off their final victory of the season, traveled back to campus to find themselves facing another battle. This was a battle they'd never imagined having to face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These men witnessed an SUV plunge over an embankment, hit a tree, roll over several times, and land on its top in a creek.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bus filled with Shawnee State soccer players pulled to the side and went to the rescue. What they found at the bottom of the dark ravine was a family trapped, a family of three. The soccer team broke the vehicle's windows and rescued all the family members safely. Thankfully, the family is alive and well today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing these amazing student athletes of Shawnee State University: Paul Adkins, Ryan Appell, Bryan Barker, Jordan Buck, Barry Collins, Michael Cornell, Steven Cox, Rocky Dunkin, Danny Frantz, Ross Frantz, Chris George, Curtis Jones, Andrew Kachilla, Bobby Krauss, Matt Lonsinger, Michael Mohr, Rusty Ortman, Graham Purdy, Brad Reffitt, Kurt Rininger, Drew Sampson, Ken Shonkwiler, Weston Thobaben, Jonathon Venters, and head coach Ron Goodson for their incredible  act of heroism and bravery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let's say a prayer that the family continues to do well.</paragraph>
