    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, anyone who was alive at the time will always remember the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Soviet bloc crumbling, the western world rejoiced as freedom spread to populations once thought hopelessly in the grip of Communist oppressors. There was reason to believe that the Soviets' brutal form of tyranny was over forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, recent actions seem to be giving new life to old Communist ghosts. Police squads crushing the Kremlin's dissenters, advocates of freedom and transparency silenced, cultural figures detained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the recent backsliding in Russia should be cause for alarm for all freedom loving people. As the Kremlin's power expands, freedom for the Russian people shrinks. This was wrong during the Cold War and it is wrong now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time that the free nations of the world take a stand against this trend and start demanding more from Mr. Putin and Russia's leaders.</paragraph>
