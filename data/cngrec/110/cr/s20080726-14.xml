  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take this moment to remind everybody that today is National Day of the American Cowboy as designated by Congress. I was hoping to be at Cheyenne Frontier Days to make that announcement today, along with my fellow Senator, Mr. Barrasso, but our votes make that virtually impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be a huge celebration there at Cheyenne Frontier Days, which is the daddy of them all, the first rodeo, the biggest rodeo, but at rodeos all over the country and on ranches all across the country, we will be recognizing the hard work and strong ethics of the American cowboy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Delaware is recognized.</chair>
