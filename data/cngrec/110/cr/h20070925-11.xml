    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to introduce to the Members of this body Imam Yusuf Saleem, a devoted servant of the Muslim faith and a recognized leader of the Muslim community. Imam Saleem is a graduate of Howard University, where he earned both his bachelor's of arts degree as well as his master's degree in education. He is a devoted educator who has held the rank of professor, principal, and teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the brutal terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Imam Saleem, along with other prominent leaders of the Muslim community, met with President George Bush to condemn the attacks and to establish a unified front against terrorism. As spokesman for this historic meeting, Imam Saleem's remarks, along with those of President Bush, helped to clarify for the American people the peaceful nature of the religion of Islam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imam Saleem's tireless work has not gone unnoticed. In August 2002, the District of Columbia awarded Imam Saleem the first mayoral clergy award. In 2002, he was named Muslim man of the year by members of the Muslim community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, please join me in welcoming to the floor a true citizen-servant who is committed to his faith, his family, and the United States of America.</paragraph>
