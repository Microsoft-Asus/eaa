    <paragraph>Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will be in a period for morning business. At 3:30 p.m., the Senate will proceed to consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill, <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>. As I announced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes today. This week is slated to be the last week of the work period prior to the Easter recess. However, we must work toward finishing the supplemental before we can do this, and I am going to be meeting in the next few minutes with the distinguished  Republican leader to see if that is possible to do.</paragraph>
