  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Louisiana State University Tigers football team on winning the 2007 Bowl Championship Series national championship game, and to congratulate the players, coaches, and LSU fans on a tremendous 2007 football season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 7, 2008, the LSU Tigers took on the Ohio State University Buckeyes in a newly reopened Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The 2007 BCS national championship game was a treat for fans all over the Nation, and a celebratory moment for New Orleans as the Superdome observed its return to hosting big events after the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. And it was quite a celebration as the Tigers defeated the Buckeyes 38-24.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ohio State got off to a 10-0 start, but LSU never backed down and went on to score 31 unanswered points. Led by game captains quarterback Matt Flynn, safety Craig Stelz, fullback Jacob Hester, punter Patrick Fisher and defensive tackle Glen Dorsey, the Tigers proved that they deserved to play in the championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Tigers team played with extraordinary heart all season. In 2007, LSU beat seven nationally ranked teams, and their only two losses each came in triple overtime games. A very talented senior class created a sense of urgency throughout their leadership, and the rest of the team never stopped playing with heart throughout this record-setting season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Defensive tackle Glen Dorsey won four prestigious awards, including the Lombardi Trophy, and has been a model player off the field as well by encouraging young people to "dream big" this year. Quarterback Matt Flynn threw 21 touchdown passes this season and had a career high of four touchdown passes during the championship game. Finally, Jacob Hester rushed for 1,103 yards and scored 12 touchdowns during the 2007 season. This was truly a multi-talented team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to Coach Les Miles and the rest of the LSU coaching staff. The players and staff have come together to create a preeminent football program with a record two BCS titles in just the past 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his tenure as head coach at LSU, Miles has led his team to three bowl victories and an impressive 34-6 record. Congratulations are also in order for the dedicated State and university community. The avid Tiger fans have supported their team all season and helped to set a Superdome record of 79,651 people in attendance for the BCS championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of former Governor Kathleen Blanco, the Tigers "embodied Louisiana's fighting spirit." The entire State deserves to celebrate this title and begin to look forward to the 2008 season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate the Louisiana State University Tigers football team, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 933, commending the Louisiana State University Fighting Tigers football team for winning the Bowl Champion Series national title game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to first thank my good friend, the dean of our Louisiana delegation, RICHARD BAKER, for sponsoring the resolution, as well as Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon of the Education and Labor Committee for bringing it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 7, the LSU Tigers overcame an early first-half deficit of 10-0 to defeat the Ohio State University Buckeyes by a score of 38-24 in New Orleans. This was the second time the Tigers have won a BCS title in the Louisiana Superdome. The Tigers were led by the game's offensive MVP, senior quarterback Matt Flynn, who threw four touchdown passes, and defensive MVP, sophomore defensive end Ricky Jean-Francois, who blocked a field goal and had six total tackles and a half sack. This is the  second year in a row that a Southeastern Conference team, arguably the most dominant conference in college football today, has beaten Ohio State to win the BCS national title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the birth of the Bowl Championship Series in 1998, LSU is the first team to win two BCS national championship titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Led by seniors Matt Flynn, Jacob Hester, Ali Highsmith, Chevis Jackson, Jonathan Zenon, Craig Steltz, and Glenn Dorsey, the Tigers won 12 games  during the 2007 season. Seven games were won against nationally ranked opponents, as well as seven games against conference opponents, including the University of Tennessee Volunteers in the Southeastern Conference championship game by a score of 21-14.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since his first season as LSU head coach in 2005, Les Miles has fearlessly led the Tiger football program to 34 overall wins, 20 SEC victories, and 14 wins over nationally ranked opponents. He has brought the Tigers to two SEC championship games, three consecutive bowl wins, two of which were BCS games, and one BCS national championship. Coach Miles has also had three consecutive double-digit win seasons, a school record. And he's clearly well known for the fourth and short conversions. He's  fearless as a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not also forget that, foremost, these student athletes perform just as hard in the classroom as they do on the football field. Coach Miles insists that his first goal for his team is a 100 percent graduation rate. And I'm proud to say that 14 members of this national championship football team were placed on the 2007 SEC Fall Academic Honor Roll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 Tigers fought through great adversity, thanks to a grueling schedule, injuries, and conference losses, to secure their place in the national championship game against Ohio State. This championship is very special to the LSU system and to my great State of Louisiana. And it's my honor to recognize Coach Les Miles and the 2007 LSU Tiger football team for all its great accomplishments this season and for bringing home the BCS crystal ball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Geaux Tigers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no greater fan of the LSU Tigers than Mr. Melancon from Louisiana, and I yield him such time as he may consume to speak about this championship for the LSU football team.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400635" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague very much for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with Mr. Boustany's remarks. Of course most people from most States are very proud when their colleges become the national champion, and particularly in this past year I have had conversations over the last several days with friends about the Presidential election and the analogy is it's almost the same as the NCAA season of who's going to be first and second in any given week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at the end of the day, LSU rose to the occasion. They had a very successful year, a very successful and accomplished coach in Les Miles to take them where they did go, having beat No. 9 ranked Virginia Tech. Then, unfortunately, in overtime, losing to 17th ranked Kentucky and then the unranked Arkansas Razorbacks, which I caught a little grief from those guys that are from the Arkansas delegation. But in the end, it was worth all that occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife went to a small university where when the coach makes the team a winning team and gets into the national rankings, somebody usually steals them, pays them more money and moves them on. Fortunately, for us at LSU, I think we have the stature and a nature that we can keep our coach and continue to bring the talent to the university to go forward over the next couple of years, or into the future, for that matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to commend LSU for the great win in the BCS bowl, for being number one. I would like to commend the SEC. I believe that the SEC is probably the number one conference in the country. Maybe some of our colleagues would disagree with us, but at the same time, until they prove that they can win two BCS games in the short history of the BCS bowl, then we will take that gauntlet and we will run forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as Mr. Boustany said, Geaux Tigers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Louisiana's remarks and associate myself with them as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an alumni of the LSU Medical School, I want to thank two members of my staff, both of whom were LSU graduates, Ryan Evans and Michael Hare, who helped me prepare my remarks for today. And I want to thank them and congratulate them on their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my friend from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it may seem a little unusual for a Member from Texas to stand in tribute to Louisiana State University, but I do. I take off my hat and hair in tribute to the Louisiana State University Tigers and also to the relationship that Texas and Louisiana have shared. Through the years, Louisiana has helped Texas. After Katrina, Texans were proud to assist Louisiana. When we heard that Louisiana State University needed a quarterback, then my hometown, Tyler, Texas, was proud  to yield one of its best, Matt Flynn, to LSU to help them in their time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I watched Matt Flynn play high school football 4 years there at Robert E. Lee High School in Tyler, and we are so proud of Matt. He comes from good lineage. His dad, Alvin Flynn, played quarterback for Baylor University. His mother was the director for many years of the Tyler Junior College Apache Belles and took them to national fame. And Alvin did take a lot of Flak because his son didn't follow his footsteps and play quarterback at Baylor University, but such is the nature of Texans and East  Texans. When they see someone in need, as they saw LSU, it was their heart-rending desire to help them and to send them our best, Matt Flynn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So congratulations to LSU. We're proud of Matt Flynn, and we're proud of what the Tigers did in making actually the whole Nation proud.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank my colleague from Texas for his remarks and thank him for sending Matt Flynn over to LSU. But I want to remind him that Jim Bowie shed blood at the Alamo for Texas. He's a very famous Louisianian from my district, my neck of the woods, and since he sacrificed so much, I would ask my colleague to keep sending plenty more quarterbacks over to Louisiana. We'll take them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
