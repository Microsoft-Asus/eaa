  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="CORPORAL TANNER O'LEARY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal Tanner O'Leary and his heroic service to our country. As a member of the Army's C Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division based in North Carolina, Corporal O'Leary was serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On December 9, 2007, he was killed in action in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of rural Eagle Butte and a 2003 graduate of Timber Lake High School, Tanner joined the Army in 2005. His teachers remember Tanner as a student who loved to learn. He was active in school science fairs and on the football team. As his former science teacher recalls, "Once Tanner latched on to something he didn't let go; I know that was how it was with him with the Army as well."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing up on a ranch west of Timber Lake, Tanner was a hard worker who enjoyed spending time with his family. He took great pride in his daughter Alexis, and his family will always remember what a wonderful father he was. Friends and family will miss Tanner's easygoing, fun-loving personality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal O'Leary gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country. I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Corporal O'Leary. He will be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.</paragraph>
