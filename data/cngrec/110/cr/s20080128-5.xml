  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a year ago today, the Presiding Officer gave one of the classic speeches in American history as a freshman Senator responding to the State of the Union Message. It was a message that was accepted on both sides of the aisle by the people of Virginia and everyone in this country. I wish to remind the Senator what a great public service he rendered last year in giving this speech.</paragraph>
