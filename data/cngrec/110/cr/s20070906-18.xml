    <paragraph>Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues for moving so rapidly through the Military Construction legislation. It brings us to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which Senator Gregg, my friend and neighbor from New Hampshire, and I will be handling. I want to make a couple comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there are Senators who have amendments, I urge that they bring them to the floor. I understand because of the policy luncheons, it will probably be about an hour before we get to an amendment. But if there aren't any amendments pending, it would be my intent, if the Senator from New Hampshire has none, to go to final passage. We would like to wrap up this bill, if we can, today. I thank both Senator Reid and Senator McConnell for calling up this bill. I also thank Chairman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say, at the risk of causing political problems for him back in my neighboring State of New Hampshire, how appreciative I am to Senator Gregg and his staff for the bipartisan way they worked with me and my staff. Senator McConnell and I had established this way of doing things for a number of years, when he was chairman and I was chairman. We realized that, almost like the Vandenberg rule, bipartisanship has to begin at the water's edge. We have tried to do that  with this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a balanced bill. When it was reported out of the Appropriations Committee, 28 of the 29 members of the committee voted for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a housekeeping matter, I remind Senators that on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 83 to 14, the Senate approved <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, clearing the measure for the President. This act will significantly improve transparency and accountability in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has not yet signed it, but I want to inform Senators that we intend to abide by the requirements of that legislation during the consideration of this bill. The legislation requires that the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction certify that certain information related to congressionally directed spending be identified and that the required information be available on a publicly accessible congressional Web site in a searchable format at least 48 hours before a vote. The information  required includes the identification of the congressionally directed spending and the name of the Senator who requested it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to this legislation, I notify my colleagues that the committee bill and report do not include any congressionally directed spending as defined by <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>. A description of how the committee addresses this issue is contained in the committee report numbered 110-128, dated July 10 of this year. It has been on the Internet for a couple months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the certification by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Senator BYRD: I certify that the information that will be required by <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, when it becomes law, related to congressionally directed spending, has been identified in the Committee report numbered 110-128, filed on July 10, 2007, and that the required information has been available on a publicly accessible congressional website in a searchable format at least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Senator Gregg and I did, of course, do our best to address the many requests we received. We have made some difficult choices. The bill contains a total of $34.4 billion in budget authority. The President has threatened to veto all appropriations bills that are above his budget request. This bill is $700 million below the President's budget request. In case anybody did not hear that, it is $700 million below the President's budget request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a significant increase for State Department and U.S. Embassy operations and security costs. We provide $1.35 billion for assessed contributions to international peacekeeping missions. These are peacekeeping missions the U.S. Government has voted for in Sudan, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Lebanon, and other nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide $5.09 billion to combat HIV/AIDS. That is $940 million above the President's request but within the overall budget limits. This includes $590 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Added to the $300 million in the Labor, Health and Human Services bill, it is a total of $890 million for the Global Fund, an increase of $166 above last year's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill contains $476.5 million for Child Survival and Maternal Health. These programs address the most basic public health needs in the world's poorest countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our country, we are blessed with so many riches. For a child born here, almost always maternal health care and child health care is available. They  can believe the water they are going to drink will be clean water. They can be given a schedule where the child will be given certain shots, inoculations, and so on, at certain times. In all likelihood--barring an accident or rare disease--that child is going to grow up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so many of these other countries, they do not even list a child's birth until they are 2 years old because of the enormous number who die either in childbirth, where the mother can die also, or die of diseases easily controlled--dysentery, malaria, things such as that--before the child is even old enough to walk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say it is not an economic issue with us. We are blessed with the wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth. We are so blessed. I think it is a moral responsibility for us to help in these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide $509 million for educational and cultural exchange programs, particularly to build bridges with predominantly Muslim countries. We should have these exchanges. We should have as many students coming to America as possible, and as many of our students going over to these other countries as possible. Maybe they will learn some languages. Maybe they will learn different cultures. Maybe our own students will come back having learned there is a world outside our borders, but those who come  here will learn something about the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide lifesaving programs for millions of destitute refugees and displaced persons in Darfur, Iraq, the Middle East, and Colombia. More than 4 million Iraqis have fled their homes. Many of these people have worked for the U.S. Government or U.S. contractors or the U.S. news media and are being targeted because of those affiliations. They cannot even get help in getting out of there. They supported us. Now--whether one was for or opposed to the war in Iraq, these people helped us--it is time  for us to help them. Other Iraqis are being killed simply because they are academic scholars or officials of Iraq's Ministry of Education. We have a moral responsibility to help these people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is up to $1 billion in the bill for humanitarian and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan to help counter the resurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides $1.2 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation. We support the Millennium Challenge Corporation, but they have had $6 billion appropriated since 2004, and they have only disbursed about $100 million. I felt they ought to use some of the undisbursed money they already have, to give us some of the other money for much greater needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are provisions in the bill considering international family planning the President said he would veto. That is no surprise. We have had these provisions in past bills. These are the same provisions that have been in the State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill year after year. Every year, the President says he will veto it because of it. We will have time for that debate later on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I recall what Senator Mark Hatfield, the then-chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said. Mark Hatfield--a strong right-to-lifer, as strongly opposed to abortion as anybody else I have ever met--pointed out those family planning moneys actually cut down on abortions around the world. When they have been cut off, abortions have gone up. Sometimes we should get beyond the sloganeering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Reagan, God rest his soul, used to give some speeches about how we needed a Constitutional amendment to ban abortions. Of course, he never supported one here and never asked to have one introduced. But it was a great speech. Many objected to President Clinton because he was pro-choice. Now we are back to somebody who is a right-to-lifer. But do you know what. As a matter of curiosity, abortions went up under President Reagan. They went down under President Clinton. Now they are going  back up again. I wish we would never have abortions, but let us give alternatives to abortion in family planning. Sometimes the reality shames the rhetoric. The fact is, abortions went up during President Reagan's time, and they went down during President Clinton's time, and they are going back up now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same thing can happen here. Give people family planning money and abortions will go down. We saw this in Russia. We have seen it categorically in other parts of the world. But that will be a debate for later on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My main point coming here was to say we would not have gotten the bill out with this kind of huge bipartisan support without the strong help of the former Governor, now Senator, Judd Gregg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Hampshire.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="COMPENSATION FOR UNITED STATES EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me join and participate in expressing my appreciation to Senator Leahy and his staff for bringing forward a bill that is a reasonable bill. It is within the budget requested by the President. In fact, it is a little bit underneath it. It has a very strong commitment to the right priorities, and Senator Leahy deserves great credit. He has been instrumental on the issue of how we proceed in foreign policy for many years. Prior to my assuming this  ranking position, Senator McConnell and he worked together hand in hand to address these issues, which cover the globe, are complicated but have a huge impact on an awful lot of lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate his exceptional work in this area, and I appreciate the fact he has brought forward a piece of legislation which I am happy to support with enthusiasm. There are some issues, obviously, on policy which hopefully will be straightened out and which have been alluded to. They are primarily the issues of Mexico City and the Kemp-Kasten language. But the bill itself is basically a very strong bill, and it is within the budget as requested by the President. Therefore, hopefully, we can  get the Mexico City language straightened out and move on to passing the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His staff--Tim Rieser and the Democratic staff--have been extraordinarily fair to our staff--Paul Grove and our people on this side--and we appreciate their courtesy. When we raised issues, they tried to address them and resolve them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to point out a few highlights in this bill. The chairman has mentioned a number of them. I think it is important to recognize we are a compassionate Nation, committed to trying to help people who we see in need. This bill reflects that innate quality of the American people. It is one of our great characteristics as Americans that we as a nation and as a people try to reach out to those who have not been dealt quite as good a hand as we have been dealt and try to help them across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We use a lot of American taxpayers' dollars to do that. People work hard for those dollars. When we spend them in other countries, people want to be sure, of course, they are spent well, and they want to be sure they are getting results. They expect them to be spent to benefit regions of the world that have not been quite as lucky as we have been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the commitment in this bill to AIDS, which is huge--$5 billion--is important. It is something that has been bipartisan. The President has clearly taken the lead on this issue. This committee has strongly supported those initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have made a very significant effort in the area of humanitarian aid dealing with migration and refugee assistance and with international disaster assistance. That is what these dollars are used for. When you go out and you meet folks, as all of us do--that is one of the fun parts of doing this job, representing our constituents and hearing from them--sometimes--actually, not that often in New Hampshire and I suspect not that often in Vermont, but sometimes you hear people say: What are  we sending all this money overseas for? Those are dollars we worked hard for and could spend here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we spend them overseas, first, because we are a nation which is blessed--and we understand others are not--and when we see things we can try to help with, such as the AIDS epidemic in Africa. We also send these dollars overseas because, quite honestly, it benefits us. It is that simple: It benefits us. It benefits us on two levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it benefits us on a national security level. Most or many of these dollars which we spend under this bill essentially go to countries which undertake actions which assist us in our national security and pick up burdens which we might otherwise have to pick up, not only with dollars but also with American troops being at risk. So it is a good investment from that standpoint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we basically are a trading nation. Our great success as an economy is the fact we are engaged, we are the international economy. Participating in that economy is critical to creating jobs and economic benefit here. Thus, we use these dollars, to a significant degree, to stabilize regions and give them economic viability. Quite simply, we can then participate in that economic viability by selling them goods--products or services--which we manufacture or make in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it benefits us. So these dollars which we spend--and they are significant; $34 billion is a lot of money--are dollars which we spend well, I believe, on behalf of the American people in most instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, for example, we significantly assist the military efforts of the nations of Egypt, Israel, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other allies around the globe. We have increased the funding, for example, rather significantly to the country of Jordan. Let's take that as an example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is a country right in the middle of the Middle East, which is a linchpin in the Middle East which represents stability, represents a forward-thinking Government, that cares for its people and wants its people to succeed but does not have the resources of many of those nations in the Middle East that have the good fortune to have oil or gas. Yet they take on responsibility that we would have to otherwise take on. They take on massive numbers of refugees from Iraq, which has strained significantly  their infrastructure and their educational system and the culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have some obligation, I believe, to support a country which is willing to take these types of steps to assist its neighbors but also has duress to some degree because of our efforts in that region. So that is why I think increasing the funding for Jordan is very appropriate. I certainly hope we will be able to maintain that as we move through the entire process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no earmarks in this bill. We obviously have had quite a battle in this Congress over how many earmarks people should have, what types of earmarks people should have. This bill is pretty much earmark free. In fact, unless you consider funds going to a foreign government requested by the President as an earmark, there are virtually no earmarks in this bill, for which, again, I congratulate the chairman for that sort of leadership. As he said, he is complying with <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, which passed this  body back in July. It has not been signed yet, but we presume it will be, or at least the language relative to how earmarks in appropriations bills are handled will certainly go into force. So I congratulate the chairman for pulling this bill together in that form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to speak briefly, though, about one area which I am concerned about and which I find to be a bit of an affront--more than a bit--a real affront, and that is dollars which we are allocating to certain activities in this international arena which are being wasted, they are being fraudulently handled, they are being used for patronage or there is simple corruption, which is stealing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have three examples of that which are rather severe. We are missing $8 billion, minimum--remember, the number, I suspect, is significantly higher--in Iraq in reconstruction. A lot of the reconstruction money which we are supposed to be spending in Iraq doesn't appear to be getting out into the field, the rubber doesn't seem to be hitting the road. The money seems to be somewhere; we are not sure where. We hear representations that it may be buying buildings in Switzerland rather than building  buildings in Iraq, but we know, because the money is not moving out, that the dollars are not there and not doing what they are supposed to be doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This concerns many of us on both sides of the aisle. The GAO has been giving us report after report. The special Inspector General has been giving us report after report highlighting this concern, which is that there is and appears to be significant corruption, and that corruption is misallocating funds--American tax dollars--in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, another example of concern is the World Bank. The World Bank has just taken on a new leader, Secretary Zoellick, Ambassador Zoellick, who is one of the strongest individuals I have met in my experience in public life. I think he is one of the best public servants I have come across. He is totally committed to doing things the right way and has no problem making a decision and shaking a place up, that is for sure. I think he is going to be good for the World Bank. But he comes into  a situation which has very big issues relative to the dollars that are being spent there. Reports are coming out that literally hundreds of millions--if not billions--of dollars are being siphoned off from these grants, that there is inadequate oversight, that there is a lack of transparency, that there is shoddy accounting, and that there is just plain theft going on of some of these dollars. We have examples of corruption which appear to be fairly significant in Kenya, in Guyana, in India, in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are American tax dollars. We are going to put $1.1 billion into the World Bank with this bill, and the American taxpayer, at least the people from New Hampshire and, I am sure, the people from Vermont, don't expect those dollars to be spent to line the pockets of some corrupt official in one of these nations. They expect them to be spent to assist the people in those nations who haven't been as fortunate as we have. The World Bank has to get its act cleaned up, and that begins with transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in this bill we have put in significant language--I believe it is significant--which will essentially fence 20 percent of the appropriations until we hear from the World Bank that they have made public the available financial disclosure forms, that the bank has established a plan and a schedule for conducting regular independent audits, that the bank is adequately staffing and sufficiently funding the Department of Institutional Integrity, and that the bank has made publicly available the  bulk of the panel report which we wish to see. We may add another thing to that. We want to make it unalterably clear that we are tired of the obfuscation that is coming out of the World Bank and that the World Bank makes public the Department of Institutional Integrity November 23 report relative to the India issue, which has received a fair amount of attention recently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are fencing these funds. They are not going to get this money until we get some accounting rules that work over there. I think with Secretary Zoellick now in charge, he will be equally aggressive in making sure that this sort of action occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, of course, there is the United Nations. I have always supported funding the United Nations. I strongly support the United Nations as an institution, as a concept, and as a key player in world events in order to try to give the world a place where it can come together and resolve disputes, especially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But once again, we have a track record of mismanagement and shoddy accounting, and sometimes no accounting, and patronage and misuse of tax dollars that are rather staggering. Article after article has been reported in this area. It is--the U.S. taxpayer picks up about a quarter of the cost of the United Nations--a disproportionate amount quite honestly, in my opinion--but we do it because we believe in that institution. But it is very hard to tell an American taxpayer that the dollars they are  sending to the United Nations, if it goes into certain accounts is going to disappear, or it is going to be used to give a job to somebody's cousin  who is coming in from some country where they couldn't get him a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, I say this is an issue we are going to focus  on in order to try to get some fair and honest accounting, transparency, and a system that uses at least American tax dollars efficiently to benefit the world rather than uses them to benefit individuals who happen to be in high places or have found themselves in positions to take advantage of the situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So those are issues I think are critical. The corruption issue is very high, at least on my agenda, as to how we handle these dollars. But that doesn't undercut the basic need here, which is to have a strong and vibrant commitment to foreign aid assistance and to international assistance which addresses priorities that we have as a nation in dealing with other countries and also addresses the needs of other people around this globe where we see we can make a difference, such as in the AIDS area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again I congratulate the chairman who has done a good job on this bill, his staff has done a good job on this bill, our staff has done a good job on this bill, and I hope we can pass it promptly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of amendments from our side. I have been made aware of a number of amendments, and we are ready to start the amendment process, and whenever people want to start offering amendments--I see the Senator from Florida is here and I know he has two very good amendments that I will certainly be supportive of, I suspect, and I will be happy to proceed if he wants to offer them, and I will be happy to hear them. I presume there will be no votes until about 2:30.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to reserve that request and I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be agreed to, that the bill as thus amended be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, and that no points of order be waived by virtue of this agreement.</paragraph>

  <chair>The Senator from Florida Mr. [MARTINEZ] proposes an amendment numbered 2694.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <narrative>(Purpose: To promote democracy in Cuba)</narrative>
  <narrative> On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CUBA DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sec. 699B.  (a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by title III under the subheading "ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUND" under the heading "Other Bilateral Economic Assistance" is hereby increased by $30,700,000 and such amount shall be available for the Cuba democracy assistance program to assist the pro-democracy movement in Cuba and shall be in addition to any other amounts appropriated or made available for such purposes.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by title I for the Department of State and Related Agency under the subheading "DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS" under the heading "Administration of Foreign Affairs" for expenses of general administration is hereby decreased by $30,700,000.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>This amendment essentially restores $30.7 million for the Cuba Democracy Assistance Program by offsetting it from the Department of State's $3.8 billion in the general administrative budget. In conjunction with the committee's recommendation, $15 million funding for the Cuban Democracy Assistance, this amendment would now equal the administration's request. These funds are used to provide needed humanitarian assistance to Cuban civil society and pro-democracy movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that Cuba at the current time is living through a transitional moment, an historic moment. After the dictatorship of Fidel Castro of almost half a century, it appears that he no longer is in a position to govern. His brother Raul Castro has assumed power in Cuba in a way frankly that belies legitimacy or anything close to Democratic rule. It is my hope, it is the hope of those of us who support this amendment, that by restoring these funds to the amounts necessary, we will be able  to help the Cuban people create the conditions within the country similar to those that were created in Eastern Europe through our assistance to the forces of democracy and freedom. We now see the flourish in democracies of Eastern Europe and we relish the opportunity that they have brought to those people. We want to see the same take place in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few days ago, I had the unusual opportunity and privilege to talk on a teleconference with members of the Civil Society--the opposition in Cuba--who hope and dream of a day when they will have the opportunity to freely speak, where human rights will be observed, and where they will have the opportunity to elect their own leaders. These folks pleaded with us to please assist them, not with high tech, if that would come, but with even the simple things such as pencils, paper, ballpoint pens,  so that they can communicate with each other and so they can create the atmosphere and the condition of a civil society that would permit the flourishing of a democracy in Cuba at this critical time and at this juncture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it would be a good idea to not reduce the funding that is going to the civil society and democracy movement in Cuba. It is humanitarian assistance. It is civil society assistance. This isn't military. This is about creating peaceful conditions of change and by allowing the Cuban people those opportunities that they otherwise would not have through the current totalitarian system that currently rules in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could talk on and on about this, but I hope that with this bill we would restore the funding to the administration recommended levels, which are not in keeping even with what was done for Eastern Europe, which are essential and which will make a big difference to the people of Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have another amendment I wish to offer at this time.</paragraph>

(a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by title I under the subheading "INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS" under the heading "Broadcasting Board of Governors" is hereby increased by $5,019,000 and such amount shall be available for the international broadcasting operations to Cuba and is in addition to any other amounts available for broadcasting operations to Cuba under title I.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by title I for the Department of State and Related Agency under the subheading "DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS" under the heading "Administration of Foreign Affairs" for expenses of general administration is hereby decreased by $5,019,000.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this amendment again deals with the budding hopes of democracy in Cuba and it deals with Radio and TV Marti. Radio and TV Marti for years has been the source of information and the source of hope, much like Radio Free Europe was for the enslaved people of Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Cuba today have no opportunity for anything close to a free press. All they get handed daily are the diatribes of the Communist regime as  they control every source of media available to the Cuban people. This amendment would restore funding to Radio and TV Marti by increasing the funding by $5 million to allow the continuation of this very important tool of democracy, which is information to the Cuban people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would point out this is a critical time in the history of this country. We are only 90 miles from the shores of Cuba. What happens in Cuba is important to the United States. It is important to our national security. At a time when we fear the potential for mass migration, at a time when we see the opportunity perhaps for political change, this would be the wrong time to cut back and to diminish our commitment to the voice of democracy, the voice of freedom, and, frankly, simply to the  voice of unfettered information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there was a condition in Cuba that created unrest or a governmental change, our defense forces, the Department of Homeland Security is greatly concerned that there would be a mass migration. It has happened in the past. Radio and TV Marti would be the tools that people such as myself, speaking in Spanish to the Cuban people, could use to urge them not to go to the high seas, not to seek to migrate but simply remain calm in Cuba. That is why TV and Radio Marti, at this critical juncture, ought  not to be cut in funding. The amendment doesn't restore it to current funding; it increases it by $5 million, which I think would be a great step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the current amendment be set aside.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Purpose: To modify the conditions on the availability of funds for the aerial eradication of coca in Colombia to address circumstances where manual eradication is too impractical or risky and to limit the requirement to implement programs to provide alternative sources of income to areas where conditions exist for successful alternative development)</narrative>
  <narrative> Beginning on page 266, line 13, strike "manual eradication" and all that follows through "municipalities where security permits" on page 267, line 12, and insert the following: "manual eradication in such areas is not practical or poses an unacceptable risk to government security forces, as determined based on consultations with appropriate authorities of the Government of Colombia:</narrative>

  <narrative>&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provided further, That such funds may not be made available unless the Secretary of State certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that complaints of harm to health or licit crops caused by such aerial eradication are thoroughly evaluated and fair compensation is being paid in a timely manner for meritorious claims, and the Secretary submits a report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing all claims, evaluations, and compensation paid during the twelve month period  prior to the date of enactment of this Act:</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provided further, That such funds may not be made available for such purposes unless programs are being implemented by the United States Agency for International Development, the Government of Colombia, or other organizations, in consultation and coordination with local communities, to provide alternative sources of income in areas where conditions exist for successful alternative development and security permits".</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this amendment deals with the situation in Colombia. This was a congressional effort started in the Clinton administration, which has been a dramatic help--and it has been continued by the Bush administration--to the people of Colombia as they fight the narcotraffickers who essentially took over that country for more than a decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of deaths and the destruction due to the drug trafficking out of Colombia that has occurred on our streets and in our neighborhoods and schools has been known for decades now. Under the presidency of President Uribe, whom the Colombian people elected in an unprecedented fashion a year ago, the Colombian Government, in partnership with us in Plan Colombia, has made a turnaround in that country relating to drug interdiction and eradication, and in the fight against these narcoterrorists  who have threatened life in Colombia as we know it. Today, life there is returning to normal. Business and trade are increasing dramatically. They are becoming the kind of neighbor we want and need. There is no closer ally in Latin America than Colombia today. Their successes have been undeniable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment seeks to change language in the current Foreign Relations appropriations bill that would dictate that air eradication not take place. We seek to restore language that would allow for air eradication of drugs to take place when it is reasonable to do so, and when to do otherwise would endanger the Colombian security forces. Rather than hamstring and tie down the Colombian forces and eliminate eradication, we are changing the language to permit it where necessary, when to do otherwise  would endanger the life of Colombians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drug eradication is vitally important. To allow the current language in the bill would diminish these important efforts so that we can eradicate drugs in the Colombian fields and not have to deal with them in our neighborhoods.</paragraph>

  <chair>The Senator from Florida (Mr. MARTINEZ) proposes an amendment numbered 2697.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <narrative>(Purpose: To increase by $30,000,000 the amount appropriated or otherwise made available for "Andean Programs" and available for aerial eradication of coca in Colombia, and to provide an offset)</narrative>

(a) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by title III under the heading "ANDEAN PROGRAMS" for the Department of State and available for aerial eradication of coca in Colombia is hereby increased by $30,000,000.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) The amount appropriated or otherwise made available by title I for the Department of State under the heading "DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR PROGRAMS" and available for expenses of general administration is hereby reduced by $30,000,000.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this amendment restores $30 million of the amount requested by the administration to continue a drug eradication program. It doesn't go as high as the administration requested, but it is higher than what came out of committee. It is vitally important to continue our commitment to drug eradication in Colombia not only by air but with other means as well. This would permit the continuation of this very important program, which we think is vital to our hemisphere's  security and to our drug eradication and interdiction efforts to keep our streets safe in America. It is also a very important component of Plan Columbia, this partnership where we have enjoyed such a positive and fruitful relationship during the presidency of President Uribe.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from Florida for his cooperation with the committee  and for bringing these amendments forward so promptly so we can address these important issues he raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Florida obviously is the leading expert in this Congress on the issue of Cuba for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that he was a refugee from Cuba. His success story is an American success story since his arrival in the United States. I am sure the Cuban people take great pride in seeing him in the Senate as a person who came to this country with nothing. We admire him for that fact. He has maintained, obviously, close ties to the issue of Cuba and how we can best  address it. His suggestions here are that we bring the funding levels for supporting initiatives relative to democracy in Cuba up by $10 million and supporting Radio Marti so it is fully funded by adding $5 million. Those are reasonable suggestions that I support. I hope we can move them forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator is also the leading expert in Congress on the issue of South America and how we deal with that. South America--the issues of Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia--is a very important issue to us as a nation. This region of the world is very close to us. What happens there has a direct and immediate impact on us both in terms of people leaving those countries and illegally coming to the United States and in terms of drugs being exported to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of Venezuela, they have a government that has a clear antipathy toward the United States and is trying to undermine American interests throughout the world, but especially in South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senator pointed out, the government has had incredible successes in Colombia, which was a basket case when it was controlled by the mob--the FARC, as it is known--for a number of years. It was the center of and remains, regrettably, a high-profile producer of cocaine, which ends up in the United States. Now they have a government that is freely elected and which is making significant strides toward establishing a functioning nondrug-based culture and economy in that country. We need to  support this government. We need to support President Uribe as he moves forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honestly haven't understood what seems to be an antipathy from the intelligentsia in the United States, especially the Northeast intelligentsia, toward President Uribe and his government. It has a lot of overtones, in my opinion, to what happened in Haiti, where the intelligentsia of the Northeast decided that Mr. Aristide was the perfect person for that nation, and it turned out he was a horrific event for that nation, as he backtracked and continues to backtrack. Why there should be antagonism  toward a government that has been freely elected with overwhelming majorities, and which is moving aggressively toward trying to control the criminals who export cocaine to this country, is hard to fathom. But that exists and I think it is unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do think we, as a government, should recognize that the Government of Colombia, and specifically President Uribe's government, has made some very significant strides toward trying to get control over the cocaine production and the FARC elements. They have done it at not only a risk to their Government but at tremendous personal risk. These folks are targeted for assassination by these criminal groups. They have shown tremendous courage in moving forward and moving their nation forward.  We should be supporting that courage. We hear from our own people--not from the Colombians but those who are fighting drugs in this country, including General Walters, who believes firmly that he needs the additional money being proposed here by the Senator from Florida in order to adequately fund the effort with primarily hardware--helicopters specifically--in Colombia in order to continue the successes we have begun to see under Plan Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Senator's initiative, and I hope we can support these amendments as we move forward. We are not going to have any votes until probably later in the afternoon, but it is good to start with these amendments. I congratulate the Senator from Florida for bringing them forward.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for his kind comments and for allowing me to move forward with these amendments. I appreciate his sentiment about the Colombian situation. There is no question that they are an ally and friend. One of the things I think is often not talked about, but is very important, is what President Uribe has done. He has had an amnesty program where people would lay down their arms and simply have to atone for what they have done; they may get a jail sentence, but they can  then reincorporate themselves into that society. They would have a job training program, have a way of getting out of the armed forces, which they did legally or illegally, including the paramilitary, or whatever. So if the rebel groups that supported the FARC lay down their arms and come back into society, that helps heal that country and bring it together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a great opportunity here to see Plan Columbia in its next phase not only continue with eradication and interdiction and fighting the guerrillas, but also with the reestablishment of economic opportunities, so we can also try to improve the lives of the Colombian people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Cuban amendments, I also appreciate his support very much. It means a great deal to me personally. I assure you that, at a moment when we are at the cusp of a democracy there, this is precisely the time in which to encourage the forces of change, forces of democracy, and provide them with the meager tools they need to communicate with each other. I think the fruits from that can be manifold.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="IRAQ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Foreign Operations bill, and I thank the managers of the bill for putting forward an excellent measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a couple of areas I wish to speak about at some length, but let me give the framework in which I will talk about it. I come to the floor a lot--I spoke this morning about military action, but I come to the floor to talk about intelligence. We are, at least in my thesis, in a worldwide war against those who have declared us to be their enemy. It is an ideological war. I think, by any stretch of the imagination, most people realize that a war against this kind of enemy is only 20 percent  kinetic, it is 80 percent economic/educational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing in this bill some people object to--spending money on foreign operations--because they think, oh, it is do-gooderism; it is trying to make us feel good, helping people in the world. Well, clearly we are carrying out an important mission to help less developed countries throughout the world. That is certainly one of the areas where America's generosity has always shown through. Our private charities are even more robust than what we do through government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to hear people back home saying: If we just cut out foreign aid, we could do this and we could do that. But foreign aid is minuscule. I, frankly, think it ought to be more. If we are going to turn the tide against those who are committed to radical views, to misusing and misinterpreting their religion to declare war on us, we have to  deal with them not only kinetically when they pick up arms or when they threaten to bomb us, but we have to  help create the conditions in those countries where people are not driven to earn a small amount of money for planting a roadside bomb or an IED or even get a little more for their family by committing suicide in a terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some things we can do through this bill that I think are very important to connect with those countries which view us with suspicion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can help change the attitude--not of everybody; not of the committed mufsidoon. Those are people who, in the name of Islam, kill innocents, men and women, fellow Muslims. They are too often called jihadists. They are not for jihad. Jihad is a legitimate self-fulfillment and improvement by Muslims. They commit hirabah, which is the terrible form of violence these Muslims commit. We need to show people in the countries from which they come that America can be a force for good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a couple of things that are very important. No. 1 is establishing and improving educational exchanges. No. 2 is economic assistance to help them build their economy. I will talk about that later. No. 3 is getting Americans on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have traveled to a lot of countries, and I have spent a lot of time in Southeast Asia. They keep telling me that the best emissaries the United States has are Peace Corps members, the Peace Corps members who have been here, and those in other volunteer organizations--if they come with a church, if they come with a charity or a nongovernmental organization, if they come with the volunteers in the financial services program. When Americans come, even as tourists, they can make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to talk just a minute about the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps, as I said, is one of the important weapons we have, not only to help them understand us but to help us understand them. At no other time in this Nation's history has the work of the Peace Corps and its volunteers been more vital or valued. Peace Corps volunteers are the good face of America in the developing world. They provide practical, hands-on experience while spreading compassion and good will, which is vital in winning  the hearts and minds of people all over the world. The United States is no longer the only game in town, and we can no longer take for granted that countries will line up to want to support the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China, for example, with over 1 trillion U.S. dollars, is aggressively engaging in courting countries all over the world on economic, diplomatic, and cultural fronts, frankly shutting us out, moving us out of the game by establishing what the Chinese call their Confucius Institutes, thus promoting their language and culture through internationally affiliated institutes. The Chinese Ministry of Education estimates that by the year 2010 there will be approximately 100 million people worldwide learning  Chinese as a foreign language. And it plans to set up 100 more. They will be learning Chinese, not English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask, why are we reducing and not increasing our efforts to promote American values, our culture, our way of life? As I said, to fight the war on terror, our efforts are 20 percent kinetic, 80 percent public diplomacy--international exchanges, education, aid, and community development. In other words, I believe that putting more sandals on the ground will prevent having to put boots on the ground in the future to fight militarily what we could have won economically with education and diplomacy  beforehand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only about 20 percent of Peace Corps volunteers are serving in predominantly Muslim countries. There are far too few. In key areas, there are just not enough. Why? We just do not have the money. The money stayed stable, and costs have gone up. We have been declining in Peace Corps participation. Why is it important to have them in Muslim countries? Because they provide alternatives to the Wahabist view of life, financed too often by our Saudi Arabian friends. They are too often promoting the  Salafists' radical agenda--barbaric ideologies, trying to reach impressionable Muslims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous accomplishments have been achieved over the past 6 years by our American volunteers, and the Peace Corps is poised to meet not only the growing demands from interested countries but from thousands of Americans who want to serve as well. I believe the Peace Corps should obtain its full request in 2008 in order to expand opportunities to enter these countries, vitally important countries in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, and I hope we will get a more robust request from the administration  next year. It should not be hindered in expanding the number of volunteers in countries where the Peace Corps already exists and is advancing American ideals and building good will. Budget tightening has already occurred at many posts, and program closures are likely without additional funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our diplomats and host country officials say that the Peace Corps is the most effective and cost-efficient U.S. agency in getting a better view of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the conference committee. I hope we will be able to restore the President's full request for the Peace Corps. It is an investment in an effort vitally important to improving the lives of those in the developing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to talk about another initiative. I have been on the floor talking about it a long time; that is,  effective grass roots development for agriculture in Afghanistan. Agriculture is the main building block of the Afghan economy, but it has suffered from disinvestment and neglect. Over 70 percent of Afghans live in rural areas and derive their income from agriculture. Yet the public and private support infrastructure for agriculture is yet to be rebuilt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked to some Missouri farmers--I will discuss it more later--who were over there with our National Guard. They tell us that they believe the Afghans could move a tremendous leap forward if we got them 19th century, not 21st century, not 20th century, but 19th century tools and equipment because they are that far behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the managers of the bill. They have used in this bill $20 million for USAID to set up and develop a nationwide agriculture extension system. It would establish and execute a strategy through a consortium of U.S. land grant universities, integrating the program into Afghanistan institutions, guided by local councils, comprising community, private sector, and government education leaders. Our U.S. education extension service transformed American agriculture over the last hundred years,  and it can do a lot to improve the livelihood of the people in Afghanistan and counter the other influences, such as the cultivation of poppies for the drug trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we have given money to USAID in the past, and it has been largely ineffective. USAID has refused to set up an extension system in Afghanistan. They continue to rely on large, DC-based contractors who apparently have had no impact. They lack that expertise and capacity-building know-how and expertise which will create sustainable development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 5 years and hundreds of millions of dollars later, after USAID has been spinning its wheels, Afghanistan now accounts for 92 percent of the world's opium supply. I recognize USAID and the Department of State are large bureaucracies that cannot operate as effectively as the military can in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the community development efforts they are tasked with are paramount to establish a strong economy that will allow the Afghan farmers and the Afghan people  an alternative to opium production. When I was in Iraq, for example, I observed our warfighters taking action and picking up the mantle where State and USAID's hands were tied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Ramadi, we saw the marines, after they had pacified Ramadi, went in and rebuilt the Blue Mosque, the absolutely central Sunni mosque for that entire region. There was a tremendous amount of goodwill created, showing them we supported their religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Afghanistan, a member of my staff, a month ago, returned from Nangarhar Province with members of the Missouri National Guard. As a result of my working with the Guard and what we saw on the ground and the fact that the President, Hamid Karzai, had asked for extension service assistance but USAID was not able to produce it,  I asked the National Guard to send an agricultural development team over to see what could be done. They came back with a very  promising response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The team and subsequent others we hope will be established by the Department of Defense through the National Guard will be composed of citizen soldiers who come, in their civilian lives, from farming, agribusiness, and construction trades. Each AG team will have extension service experts--whether it is in soil or meat technology or other things that have been identified as pressing needs. They are going to focus on more efficient use of irrigation, crop rotation, cold storage, harvesting, processing,  and agribusiness. They will not just be giving farmers seeds, they will be building real, long-term relationships and capacity-building that will sustain agriculture in Afghanistan, to bring it into the 19th and even into the 20th century. They will be doing so in a place where building trust with the populace is paramount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my time as Governor, I have always been impressed with not only the capacity and the ability and dedication of our National Guard throughout the United States but their flexibility. The National Guard structure, capabilities, and the skill-set of the citizen soldiers in the Army are uniquely positioned to execute a position that many others are incapable of fully executing. I hope the USAID and State Department will follow the lead of its Department of Defense cohorts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  As I said, 80 percent of the war on terror is nonkinetic--agricultural development, education exchanges, Peace Corps volunteers, and public diplomacy. If USAID continues to rely on giving large chunks of money to cumbersome contractors in its foreign aid, it will fail, and I will see if I can convince my colleagues to choose another route.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Efforts in Afghanistan, like the land grant extension initiative and the agricultural development teams, are models for how we should be conducting the nonkinetic war we must fight against those who vowed continuing war against us and the way of life we espouse.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="IRAQ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak to one of the amendments pending before the Senate on Cuba democracy. But before I speak to that specific amendment, I wish to start off by thanking Chairman Leahy for all of his hard work on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. His leadership on crucial issues around the world is critical. I also appreciate his support for human rights around the world--Latin America and other places--as well as his willingness to work with me and  my staff. So we appreciate his leadership on what I believe is overall an exceptional bill that has been brought to the Senate for its consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't know my colleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, was going to come to the floor earlier. I would have joined him at the time. But I certainly wish to join him in promoting this amendment and Cuban democracy. This amendment is simple and for a simple but powerful purpose: to support democracy inside of Cuba. I believe that no matter where we as Members of the Senate stand on the issue of U.S. policy toward Cuba--and I recognize there are diverging views--every Member of this  body, however, I suspect, supports achieving democracy in Cuba and therefore should support this particular amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, we are at a critical time for democracy in Cuba. Some would ask: Why now? Why should we increase the funding for Cuban democracy right now in this legislation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would answer: Right now, we face a moment of hope for the Cuban people. Right now, we face a moment of hope for the Cuban people who have suffered under the only dictatorship in the entire hemisphere--a dictatorship of 48 years. Dictatorships, whether they be from the left or the right, are nonetheless dictatorships. They are an oppression of people, and we should be against such oppression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes I hear from some the romanticism of who Fidel Castro is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They forget that he is, above all, a dictator and that he oppresses his people on a daily basis. And even at the height of what was the former Soviet Union giving billions of dollars in assistance to the Castro regime, what did he do? He still rationed, Cuban families having to wait in long lines, as they do today, because of a regime that seeks to put its money in security forces, to oppress its people, instead of feeding its own people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be against such repression. Right now we are faced with a moment of hope for the Cuban people with Castro ailing. Right now we face a potential tipping point for the Cuban opposition leaders and dissidents who risk their lives and well-being and their security and their freedom every day to speak out for democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now we have to seize this moment of hope and increase our support for democracy inside of Cuba. Now, as we look at the history of democratic movements around the world, we have learned it is at such moments that internal democratic movements need external support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at similar moments in Eastern Europe. Look at Poland's Solidarity movement; look at the former Czechoslovakia's Charter 77 movement in 1989. In each case, these internal moments were also supported from the outside. We must remember our responsibility when we hear those who formerly languished under Communist rule, when we hear people such as the famous Polish human rights activist and former President of Poland Lech Walesa say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States led the free world defending values of democracy and humanism. Your determination and your civilization bloomed with the hope of Poles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is critical that we increase our funds to support democracy in Cuba right now. A few weeks ago I participated in a video conference at the State Department with Cuban human rights activists, political dissidents, independent journalists, who took great risk to travel to the U.S. Interest Section in Havana from different parts of Cuba to speak to a group of Members of Congress, of which I was one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard one clear message: that they are facing increased pressure. Think about it. Already under a totalitarian dictatorship, even under that oppression they are facing increased pressure from the regime, and U.S. funds are critical to their ability to continue speaking out against repression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would add that dissidents and opposition leaders were united. There was well over a dozen of them in this video conference at the U.S. Interest Section, and they were united on this point, even though they are sometimes divided on other issues. On this point of receiving assistance in order to nurture the opportunity for civil society and the opportunity for change to take place, they were united.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I received a letter from these same leaders which said their needs were, among others:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicine to keep a political prisoner or dissident from dying to food, water filters, medical equipment, clothing, shoes, coats, toys for the children of political prisoners who suffer doubly the loss of a loved one who is in prison and social repression on the streets and in schools, essential vitamins, office supplies and the tools of democracy (computers, printers, phones, fax machines).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because in a closed society in which only the dictatorship owns the airwaves, whether it be that of radio, or that of television, or the state newspaper, when you cannot express your God-given right as an individual to have a different view and to speak out, and you have no form of expressing that view to those of your fellow countrymen, to have them seek to move in a different direction, what we do by providing computers and printers and phones and fax machines is the very essence of what we  take for granted here at home but for them are the very seeds, the tools they need to promote democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This letter was signed by a diverse group of Cuban dissidents, including Julio Cecilia Delgado Gonzalez, Juan Gonzalez Febles, Laura Pollan Toledo, Gidal Delgado Sablon, Candido J. Hidalgo-Gato, Vladimiro Roca Antunez, Guillermo Farinas Hernandez, Hector Palacio Ruiz, and Elizardo Sanchez Santa Cruz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very diverse group of human rights activists, political dissidents, independent journalists. They do not all agree, just as sometimes we do not all agree here, but they all seek to have democracy and human rights. They may have come at it in different  ways, but they all agree that they need help from the United States and from others throughout the world in order to achieve this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why this amendment, increasing funding in the bill to $45.7 million, is important. This is the same level of funding the President requested, the same level of funding that was included in the House version of this bill that was passed by a strong bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. We are asking for an increase in these funds. We are asking for an increase in these funds because this is exactly the moment to increase funds for Cuban  democracy. We do provide an offset for these funds, so we are not increasing the overall total of the bill. The offset is exactly what was included in the House-passed version of this bill. It is from the largest pot of money in the entire bill, for general expenses, for general administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish also to remind my friends that these programs I am talking about for democracy inside of Cuba--health, helping the human rights activists, political dissidents, journalists and activists--are carried out by organizations well known to my Senate colleagues: the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, Pan American Development Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Cuba Democracy Program also works with well-known international organizations such as France's Reporters Without Borders, the Netherlands' Pax Christi, and the Czechs' People in Need Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we would all support the type of work the Cuba Democracy programs carry out. U.S. funds support helping victims of repression. U.S. funds support advocating for human rights, including helping the wives of political prisoners advocate for their release from prison and defending their rights in jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. funds support pro-democracy activists, grantees of training Cuban dissidents on information technology, leadership, civil society activities, facilitating coordination among activists, and making small institutional developmental grants to strengthen the organizational capacity of democracy groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. funds give Cubans a voice and help disseminate activists' writing and provide Internet coverage by independent Cuban journalists. The work they do is powerful and meaningful. Between 2004 and 2005, there was a 54 percent increase in civil resistance actions within Cuba, 89 percent of which occurred outside of Havana in Cuba's provinces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2005 study by the Cuban Democratic Directorate found that actions of civil resistance have increased from 444 in the year 2000 to 3,322 in the year 2005. It is a positive trend of those who seek to create civil society and peaceful change inside of their country, toward that which we promote around the world, human rights, democracy. Ignoring this opportunity would only undermine this historic undertaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I believe this is a vote that should unite all of us wherever we stand on general U.S. policy toward Cuba. Let me remind my friends, this is not a vote on the embargo, this is not a vote on basic U.S. policies toward Cuba; we may have that discussion on some other day. By voting for this amendment, you are voting to support those in Cuba who continue to go out in the street every day, to ask for peaceful democratic change, who risk their lives, who risk their liberty. That is not  an overdramatization of the reality of the challenge those who seek to create change in the country of Cuba face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent many in New Jersey who have languished in Castro's jails for 10, 20, even 30 years. What was their crime? What was their crime that they had languished for 10, 20, or 30 years in Castro's jails? Simply to suggest, simply to suggest, that there was a better way for the Cuban people simply to speak out for those freedoms we enjoy here in this country, simply to be able to have the opportunity to worship at the altar that we choose, simply to be able to elect those who represent us in  our Government as we are privileged to serve here, simply to be able to come together and organize and demonstrate a different view than that which the Government might have at any given time, simply to speak your mind without the fear that the consequences of doing so will have you languishing 10, 20, or 30 years in Castro's gulags.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who doubts that is welcome to come to my home State of New Jersey, I am sure to the home State of my colleague from Florida, and others in the country who can visit with these human living examples of that oppression, and in many cases of the torture that they receive under the hand of this dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By voting for this amendment, you are voting to support those in Cuba who are seeking and trying to create peaceful democratic change. By voting for this amendment you are voting to provide food and clothing to support political prisoners in Castro's jails who have been imprisoned for doing nothing more than reading the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or other democratic documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wrote, when I was in the House, what is still the law of the land, title II of the Helms-Burton legislation, which is the document of that law which talks about how the United States stands ready to assist a future government pledged to democracy and transition, and then a future democratic government. We put in, under President Clinton, the first plan that described the proactive nature, the first time we proactively prepared for the possibility of a transition in a country. That document  was sent to the U.S. Interest Section and reproduced, was given to Cubans who came to the section.

    <paragraph>At this time, I would simply speak on behalf of this amendment, which is to provide $45,700,000 to the democracy movement and to assist the pro-democracy movement in Cuba and to promote democracy in Cuba. It is an essential part, as the Senator from New Jersey very eloquently discussed, of support for the dissident movement so they can have the resources necessary for them to carry out their work, so we can create a civil society in Cuba. So that, at this very critical juncture  in history--a very critical moment in history--the forces of democracy, the forces of freedom, the forces of a new way for Cuba could be heard and have the resources necessary to carry their message to others within the Cuban population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Menendez and I both listened as we discussed with these people their needs and their wants. They are not asking for things other than that which makes their work possible: The ability to have a cell phone so they can communicate with one another; pencils, paper, ballpoint pens, things as simple as that--computers, of course; printers, of course. All these things are the tools of democracy that, as we saw in Eastern Europe bring about the fruits of democracy, we can also see that  these seeds of democracy planted in Cuba, that these funds can also bear the same kind of fruit at this very critical moment of transition, we hope, in the Cuban situation.</paragraph>

  <chair>The bill clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an amendment numbered 2708.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <narrative>(Purpose: To prevent contributions to organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning)</narrative>
  <narrative>On page 308, beginning on line 18, strike "health:" and all that follows through page 309, line 4, and insert "health.".</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to describe the overview of this and go into the specifics. This amendment No. 2708 deals with the Mexico City policy. The second one deals with the Kemp-Kasten legislation. They are both policies the U.S. has in place. Kemp-Kasten has been in place over 20 years. The Mexico City policy has been in place since President Reagan. It was repealed under President Clinton and put back in place under President Bush. These are long, well-known policy issues. They  are significant policy issues. There is significant policy debate about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The centerpiece of this debate is whether the U.S. should use taxpayer funding to fund abortion overseas. That is at the centerpiece of the debate--whether the U.S. Government should use taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas. I submit that regardless of your position on abortion, we should not be using taxpayer funds to fund abortions here or overseas. A number of Americans would oppose on moral grounds that their taxpayer dollars are being used to fund abortions here or overseas but particularly  overseas. They would object to that. And a number of people would say why are we even doing something like this overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who are pro-choice might say: I am OK with abortion, but why are we using taxpayer dollars to do this overseas? Why not let those countries and governments deal with their own problems rather than us funding these issues?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a taxpayer angle on this issue and there is an overseas meddling angle on this issue, and there is obviously a major moral issue of our day that is involved with this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These amendments raise important issues. Should, as I mentioned, U.S. taxpayers be forced to subsidize international groups involved in abortions? Should U.S. taxpayers support organizations involved with coercive abortion policies? Some people support abortion but not coercive abortion. And should U.S. taxpayers be involved with organizations that are connected to involuntary sterilizations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope everybody in this body would be opposed to those last two points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As drafted, the Foreign Operations bill, unfortunately, answers yes to all three questions, and that is what this first amendment, the Mexico City language amendment, seeks to turn around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is a radical departure from both current policy and common sense, and it should make us pause. Do we want to go down this road?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first amendment I offer today addresses what is known as the Mexico City policy. This policy originated with President Ronald Reagan, as I stated previously, in 1984 and has been continued by the current administration. The Mexico City policy prohibits Federal taxpayer funds from going to organizations that perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations. The Mexico City language is this: prohibits Federal taxpayer funds from going to organizations that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter how one feels about the taking of human life through surgically induced abortions, surely we can reach some consensus that abortion is not a legitimate means of family planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I hope we can agree that taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize groups that provide abortion, many of whom object to abortion and find it morally wrong. The Mexico City policy is common sense and aligns with the values of most Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, U.S. taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize or support organizations that perform or promote abortions for overseas family planning programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In case my colleagues think, OK, that was the language in 1984, that was the world situation in 1984, let me read from a newspaper article, an AP story that was filed on August 30, 2007. The article is "Chinese victims of forced late-term abortion fight back."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article is dated August 30, 2007. It reads as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yang Zhongchen, a small-town businessman, wined and dined three government officials for permission to become a father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, permission to become a father. It didn't work. Even though he wined and dined, his wife was taken out of town and her baby was killed by injection while still inside her. This is her quote. I want to read this for my colleagues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Several people held me down, they ripped my clothes aside and the doctor pushed a large syringe into my stomach," says Jin Yani, a shy, petite woman with a long ponytail. "It was very painful. ..... It was all very rough."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some 30 years after China decreed a general limit of one child per family, resentment still brews over the state's regular and sometimes brutal intrusion into intimate family matters. Not only are many second pregnancies aborted, but even to have one's first child requires a license.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would we want to be associated with any sort of family planning that is coercive of an abortion, regardless of where you are on the choice issue? Whether you are pro-choice or not, you wouldn't want to be associated with a government, with a group that does forced abortions, coercive abortions such as I am reading about in an AP story written at the end of August of this year. Why would we want to be a part of that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article on "Chinese victims of forced late-term abortion fight back."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>[From the Houston Chronicle, Aug. 30, 2007]</narrative>
  <narrative>Chinese Victims of Forced Late-Term Abortion Fight Back</narrative>
  <narrative>QIAN'AN, CHINA.--Yang Zhongchen, a small-town businessman, wined and dined three government officials for permission to become a father.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the Peking duck and liquor weren't enough. One night, a couple of weeks before her date for giving birth, Yang's wife was dragged from her bed in a north China town and taken to a clinic, where, she says, her baby was killed by injection while still inside her.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Several people held me down, they ripped my clothes aside and the doctor pushed a large syringe into my stomach," says Jin Yani, a shy, petite woman with a long ponytail. "It was very painful. ... It was all very rough."</narrative>
  <narrative>Some 30 years after China decreed a general limit of one child per family, resentment still brews over the state's regular and sometimes brutal intrusion into intimate family matters. Not only are many second  pregnancies aborted, but even to have one's first child requires a license.</narrative>
  <narrative>Seven years after the dead baby was pulled from her body with forceps, Jin remains traumatized and, the couple and a doctor say, unable to bear children. Yang and Jin have made the rounds of government offices pleading for restitution--to no avail.</narrative>
  <narrative>This year, they took the unusual step of suing the family planning agency. The judges ruled against them, saying Yang and Jin conceived out of wedlock. Local family planning officials said Jin consented to the abortion. The couple's appeal to a higher court is pending.</narrative>
  <narrative>The one-child policy applies to most families in this nation of 1.3 billion people, and communist officials, often under pressure to meet birth quotas set by the government, can be coldly intolerant of violators.</narrative>
  <narrative>But in the new China, economically powerful and more open to outside influences, ordinary citizens such as Yang and Jin increasingly are speaking out. Aiding them are social campaigners and lawyers who have documented cases of forced abortions in the seventh, eighth or ninth month.</narrative>
  <narrative>Chen Guangcheng, a self-taught lawyer, prepared a lawsuit cataloguing 20 cases of forced abortions and sterilizations in rural parts of Shandong province in 2005, allegedly carried out because local officials had failed to reach population control targets.</narrative>
  <narrative>Chen, who is blind, is serving a prison sentence of three years and four months which his supporters say was meted out in retaliation for his activism.</narrative>
  <narrative>Many countries ban abortion after 12 or sometimes 24 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother's life is  at risk. While China outlaws forced abortions, its laws do not expressly prohibit or even define late-term termination.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jin, an 18-year-old high school dropout from a broken home, met 30-year-old Yang, a building materials supplier, in September 1998. They moved in together. A year and a half later, in January or February 2000, they discovered Jin was pregnant but couldn't get married right away because she had not reached 20, the marriage age.</narrative>
  <narrative>After her birthday in April, Jin bought porcelain cups for the wedding and posed for studio photos. On May 5, they were married.</narrative>
  <narrative>Now all that was missing was the piece of paper allowing them to have a child. So about a month before Jin's due date, her husband Yang set out to curry favor with Di Wenjun, head of the neighborhood family planning office in Anshan, the couple's home town about 190 miles east of Beijing.</narrative>
  <narrative>He faced a fine of $660 to $1,330 for not having gotten a family planning permit in advance, so he treated Di to the Peking duck lunch on Aug. 15, 2000, hoping to escape with a lower fine since this was his first child.</narrative>
  <narrative>The next day he paid for another meal with Di and the village's Communist Party secretary and accountant.</narrative>
  <narrative>He said the mood was cordial and that the officials toasted him for finding a young wife and starting a family.</narrative>
  <narrative>"They told me `We'll talk to our superiors. We'll do our best. Wait for our news.' So I was put at ease," Yang said.</narrative>
  <narrative>But three weeks later, on Sept. 7, when Yang was away opening a new building supplies store, Jin was taken from her mother-in-law's home and forced into having the abortion.</narrative>
  <narrative>Why had the officials failed to make good on their assurances? One of Yang's two lawyers, Wang Chen, says he believes it was because no bribe was paid.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Dinner is not enough," Wang said. "Nothing gets done without a bribe. This is the situation in China. Yang was too naive."</narrative>
  <narrative>Di, who has since been promoted to head of family planning for all of Anshan township, could not be reached. Officials who answered his office phone refused to take a message and gave a cell phone number for him that was out of service.</narrative>
  <narrative>Zhai Zhenwu, a sociology professor at the People's University Institute of Demographic Studies in Beijing, said that while forced, late-term abortions do still occur sporadically, they have fallen sharply.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the late '80s and early '90s, he said, some family planning officials "were really radical and would do very inappropriate things like take your house, levy huge fines, force you into procedures."</narrative>
  <narrative>Things have improved since a propaganda campaign in 1993 to make enforcement more humane and the enactment of the family planning law in 2001, he said. Controls have been relaxed, allowing couples in many rural areas to have two children under certain conditions.</narrative>
  <narrative>Still, Radio Free Asia reported this year that dozens of women in Baise, a small city in the southern province of Guangxi, were forced to have abortions because local officials failed to meet their population targets.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the province's Bobai county, thousands of farmers rioted in May after family planners levied huge fines against people with too many children. Those who didn't pay were told their homes would be demolished and their belongings seized.</narrative>
  <narrative>Yang and Jin are suing the Family Planning Bureau in their county of Changli for $38,000 in medical expenses and $130,000 for psychological distress.</narrative>
  <narrative>But it's not about the money, said Yang, a fast-talking chain-smoker. No longer able to afford to run his business, he now works as a day laborer in Qian'an, an iron mining town east of Beijing.</narrative>
  <narrative>"What I want is my child and I want the court to acknowledge our suffering," he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>A family planning official in Changli justified Jin's abortion on the grounds she lacked a birth permit. The woman, who would only give her surname, Fu, said no one in the clinic was punished for performing the procedure.</narrative>
  <narrative>The National Population and Family Planning Commission, the agency overseeing the one-child policy, says it is looking into Jin and Yang's case. Meanwhile, the evidence appears contradictory.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jin's medical records include a doctor's certificate from 2001, the year after the abortion, confirming she could not have children. Doctors in Changli county say they examined her in 2001 and 2002 and found nothing wrong with her.</narrative>
  <narrative>The court ruling says Jin agreed to have the operation. Jin says the signature on the consent form is not hers but that of Di, the official her husband courted.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sun Maohang, another of the Yangs' lawyers, doubts the court will rule for the couple lest it encourage further lawsuits. But he hopes the case will stir debate and lead to clearer guidelines on abortion.</narrative>
  <narrative>As she waits for the next round in court, Jin says she is too weak to work and has been celibate for years because sex is too painful.</narrative>
  <narrative>Her husband prods her to tell her story, but during an interview she sits silent for a long time and finally says she doesn't want to talk about the past because it's too sad.</narrative>
  <narrative>Then she quietly insists the lawsuit is something she has to do for Yang Ying, the baby girl she carried but never got to see or hold.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE">
    <paragraph>Madam President, several years ago, when I was chairing the South Asia Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, we held a hearing on a lady who went undercover in China and filmed and interviewed a number of women who had been forced into abortions. She talked about the brutality. She brought the interviews forward. This continues to go on to today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason that we as an American Government should be associated with it. Period. The Mexico City language has been a longstanding policy of the United States. It makes sense. It is something we should continue. It is gutted in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make another point on this issue. If this language remains in the bill, if the Mexico City language is not put back in the bill, or if the current language remains in the bill and it goes to the President, it will be vetoed. The President has issued a very clear statement to the Congress to maintain the language of Mexico City and Kemp-Kasten, saying very clearly, if this is in the bill, the bill will be vetoed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know why we would want to overturn a policy that has been in place for a number of years, a policy that makes common sense, to get a veto on a very important Foreign Operations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Vermont who chairs the committee and my colleague from New Hampshire who is the ranking member for many good provisions in this Foreign Operations bill. I know my colleague from Vermont has a heart for foreign operations issues, for taking care of people overseas and domestically, to do whatever he can in situations that are difficult, that are dire. We have talked about it many times. I am very appreciative of his efforts in this field. This is not the way to go. This  is something that will divide us. This is something that is harmful. It is something that will be vetoed. It is something that will bring this bill back in front of us. I believe we will have the votes to sustain the President's veto.

    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my colleagues from Vermont and New Hampshire for getting this play set. These are well-known policy issues. They have been debated a long time in this country. My guess is that most people in this body know where they stand on these particular issues. A lengthy debate is not necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I want to do is clarify what we are talking about, No. 1, and No. 2, factually these conditions continue to exist in the world and this is not something that is an old policy and not needed any longer.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my colleagues for working on this issue. It is a gut-check issue about where you stand on life, where you stand on the U.S. role around the world, where you stand on whether we should be using taxpayers' funds for abortion, where you stand on whether we should be using taxpayers' dollars to promote abortion overseas. I think those are important and key issues. They are issues on which people know where they stand, and I hope we will be able to have a positive  vote on all of these amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also say to my colleagues that if these particular provisions as currently exist in the bill, as I already stated, pass through this body and are in the ultimate bill, I believe the bill will be vetoed and we will be right back talking about this bill which has a number of very good provisions in it on foreign affairs, foreign operations that are very important, but this is certainly going to hold it up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing my comments, as we all know, many Americans are deeply opposed to abortion. If you poll the issue of taxpayer funding of abortion, a solid majority of Americans is opposed to taxpayer funding of abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They do not want a part of it. They may say: I am okay with a woman's right to choose, but I don't want us to pay for that. I don't see why the taxpayers should be paying for it, let alone abortions overseas. Many who support abortion question whether it should be used for family planning purposes, which these funds are designated to be used for. We should not force American taxpayers to subsidize organizations that perform or actively promote abortion. That is a position--if you polled that--that  would be supported by 75 percent of the American public, probably. I don't have actual poll data on it, but people don't support doing this, and there is no reason we should do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If anything, they would like to see us cut foreign operations and foreign aid budgets, and here would be a prime spot. They would be happy to see this cut taking place, and it would support their view of the role of the United States in the world and the moral authority with which the United States leads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are very difficult moral issues, and then we go and insert ourselves in a moral debate overseas--a moral debate about which we are very divided here--and it doubles the negative view of the United States meddling in a country's domestic issues and one of such key significance as life, human life; that we would meddle with U.S. taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to argue a few other points. First, some will argue incorrectly that Federal tax dollars would not have to be used for actual abortions but could still be used to support the organization's other activities. This is something you will hear a lot about: We are not actually funding abortion, we are funding an organization that happens to be associated with abortion, but it is not for abortions. Well, I think most people see through that figleaf. It fails to properly understand the  fungibility of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I represent an organization, and I have money in this pocket and money in this pocket, but the budget all flows together--it supports staff, it supports overhead--it is used to support the full organization, and that is U.S. taxpayer money. Again, we are talking about overseas. It is used to support that organization. Sure, they will show us that, yes, in our bookkeeping and recordkeeping we don't support abortions with U.S. taxpayer money, but it does support the overall organization, and  the image of that organization overseas is they support abortion. So you are funding abortion, even if the actual dollars themselves don't go for abortion. People get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think we should fall for the figleaf they are going to keep a separate set of books. It is one organization, and the money goes to support one organization that has one policy, and that policy is to support and promote abortion overseas. The organization receives funds, and they can simply reallocate private funds or other sources of financial support away from their nonabortion-related activities into their abortion activities. It frees up other money they have that they can get from  us and then use the money they have from private sources to fund abortions. So we are still helping out with abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Mexico City policy also prohibits organizations that actively promote abortion from receiving funds. This means our Federal tax dollars should not be used to support the lobbying efforts of pro-abortion organizations that are attempting to change the abortion laws in other countries. These are groups that are trying to push pro-abortion laws, pro-choice laws  in many other countries. Why should we be involved in lobbying efforts in other  countries on a controversial topic such as abortion? That makes no sense whether you are pro-life or pro-abortion as to why we should do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are basic considerations I believe we should take into account with the amendment I have offered today to strike the language in this bill which guts the Mexico City policy. The current bill language guts the Mexico City policy. In effect, my amendment would ensure the Mexico City policy stands as is. It would stand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to recognize, too, that my colleagues, particularly the Senator from California, she and I have had various debates about this. I certainly don't question her ability. I don't question her heart. We view this differently. I don't think we should be anywhere near policies that promote abortion overseas. I see no reason the United States should be involved in policies that promote abortion overseas or the support of organizations that promote abortions overseas. My colleague from California  looks at this differently. I respect her and her opinion on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope our colleagues would look at this and simply ask--particularly those who are voting on this for the first time--is this something they want the United States to be associated with. A lot of people get mad at the United States for pushing its weight around overseas. A number of people get in our face and mad at the United States for pushing cultural changes overseas. I would think most of my colleagues would be very sensitive to our pushing cultural changes overseas, saying: OK, we  have policies about democracy, we have thoughts on that; and people should be allowed to govern themselves. We don't necessarily want to push our views on major moral issues around the world today. Yet here is one of a most offensive nature to many Americans, to many people overseas, and the United States is funding it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why not take the money and use it to do water well promotion or provide AIDS drugs to help people to be able to live or malaria or tuberculosis, where there is no controversy associated with that. In those situations, people would applaud us helping them out with a problem they have, instead of getting involved in a very divisive moral issue in their country as well as ours. This doesn't make sense that we would do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, in the order of agreement, I would like to call up now the second amendment that I would propose, and I ask unanimous consent that the current one be set aside and the second amendment be called up.</paragraph>

  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <narrative>(Purpose: To prohibit funding of organizations that support coercive abortion)</narrative>
  <narrative>On page 240, beginning on line 4, strike "Provided" and all that follows through "sterilization:" on line 9 and insert "Provided further, That none of the funds made available in this Act nor any unobligated balances from prior appropriations may be made available to any organization or program which, as determined by the President, supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization:".</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this is a provision similar to the last one, as far as the issue. It is more specific. It has been the policy of the United States since 1985, and consistently been the policy of the United States through Republican and Democratic Congresses, through Republican and Democratic administrations. It is commonly referred to as the Kemp-Kasten legislation. It would require the reinsertion of what is known as the Kemp-Kasten law into this legislation. This law helps to  ensure that American taxpayers do not subsidize groups and organizations with ties to coercive abortions and forced sterilizations. So this is a narrower subset of the past amendment, the last amendment that I put forward. I would like to read it to my colleagues. It is a short amendment. It is well-known language. I would hope it would get near unanimous support in this body. We would put this language in the bill:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That none of the funds made available in this Act nor any unobligated balances from prior appropriations may be made available to any organization or program which, as determined by the President, supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coerced abortion. Involuntary sterilization. It says you cannot support groups or organizations that participate in each of those. Now, I don't know of anybody in the Congress who I have ever run into at all that supports coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen involuntary sterilization at times in the past in this country, and it was a bad, dark chapter. This is not something we want to be a part of. What we are saying is you cannot support any organization overseas that is involved in involuntary sterilizations or coerced abortions, commonly referred to, as I said, as the Kemp-Kasten legislation. This has been the law on the books for 20 years, and I think my colleagues can see why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something people don't support. It has been in place since 1985 through Republican-led Congresses and Democratically led Congresses, Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. However, year after year the language has been watered down in the Foreign Operations appropriation bill and essentially gutted. That is why in this amendment my colleagues will support it. This is language we would reinsert into this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This commonsense provision prohibits funding of these organizations. One important effect of this law has been to prohibit taxpayer funding of the United Nations Population Fund. That is what this narrow piece of the debate will be about, because of that agency's support for and participation in the management of the population control program of the People's Republic of China. This program relies heavily on Government-coerced abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This gets a bit personal with me. One of our children is adopted from China. I think often of the woman who had our child, Jenna; that somehow she fought through a system that would have paid for, in places and cases, a coerced abortion. But she fought through this system to have the child who is my daughter, who is 9 years old, and who won her third grade spelling bee contest. She is, I think, a beautiful gift to society. A beautiful gift to the world. Why would we want to be anywhere closely  associated with any government or organization that would have forced people, such as my daughter's mother, to have an abortion? I don't know why anybody would want to be associated with that or come anywhere close to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I read to my colleagues, and we inserted in the Record an AP story about this still going on today. This is not an isolated incident. This happens in many places. We have held Senate hearings with people where the local population control officials in China are very aggressive on pushing a one-child policy, and that you have to get a license for that child. Many women will flee a local community when they are pregnant in order to have their child somewhere else. My daughter was left  on the doorsteps of an orphanage by somebody who fought through that system. Maybe she was from a community that was some ways away, but somehow she fought through to have this child. Why would we want to be anywhere close to something like that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Appropriations Committee-approved bill has inappropriately removed the Kemp-Kasten provision by changing the language in important ways. It requires evidence that the UNFPA directly supports coercive abortion. We, as a civilized society, should reject the brutal practice of forced abortion, whether it is promoted directly or indirectly. If you have local population planning authorities in China who are indirectly supporting coercive abortion, do we want to be anywhere closely associated with  that? I don't think so. The bill removes the language giving the President the explicit authority to invoke the provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to allow the President to enforce this provision, as it is essential, I believe, to a civilized society. A civilized society doesn't do forced abortions, coercive abortions or involuntary sterilization. The Brownback amendment would restore the Kemp-Kasten language that has been the law for over 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have had a rigorous debate in this country about abortion, we have come to some fundamental agreements, I believe. One of those agreements is we should not use tax dollars to fund coercive abortion. It is a brutal practice and it should be stopped. We should not use this as an occasion for partisan politics. Whatever your thoughts on abortion, we should be able to agree that forced abortion goes too far. It is not worthy of the America we all know is possible. I envision an America where  the strong protect the weak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to value each life and every life, everywhere and without exception. That is why I talk often about being pro-life and whole-life. I believe the life in the womb is sacred. I believe the life of a child in Darfur is sacred and a child in China. It is a hopeful message and a unifying message and it is one that should apply in this bill on this language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Brownback amendment to prohibit funding for forced abortions and return to the sensible policy of the past 20 years and to advance a culture of life; to not get involved in other countries' internal debates on abortion, particularly ones involving forced abortions and sterilizations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE, to offer a very important amendment that could significantly enhance the health and well-being of millions of women around the globe. This amendment would overturn the so-called Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, which undermines a number of key principles and goals on which our country is based.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, this policy was put in place at a conference in Mexico City in 1984. When we learned what it really did, we dubbed it the "global gag rule." As many of my colleagues know, the policy literally gags foreign organizations that receive USAID family planning funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear about this issue. Under the gag rule, international family planning organizations that provide perfectly legal family planning services with their own funds in the countries in which they operate are prohibited from receiving U.S. assistance if they provide legal abortion services and those services include counseling or referral services, or they also do not get the funds if they publicly support the right to comprehensive reproductive health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me bring this home to you. I know you are a mom of a young child. If a mom walks into one of these family planning clinics that receives USAID funds with her 11-year-old daughter who has been raped and wants to be counseled as to what the options are or wants to be told where she can take that child, this organization will lose all their USAID funds if they help that mom and that traumatized daughter. Is this America? We are talking about punishing family planning clinics all over the world  if they use their own funds for perfectly legal activities to help families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will give you a clear example. Until 2004, abortion in Ethiopia was illegal unless the life of the mother was at stake, and complications from unsafe procedures were the second leading cause of death among hospitalized women. The Government decided to have a national debate about how to fix this problem which was taking a terrible toll on Ethiopian women. That is right, the Ethiopian Government said: Let's talk about what is right for our people, what is right for our customs, what is right  for our way of life, and how can we save women's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to weigh in on this debate, the two largest family planning organizations in Ethiopia actually had to give up their U.S. funding. That is why we call it a gag rule. The organizations were gagged from expressing themselves. They could not engage in the debate for fear of losing their funds. So the two largest family planning organizations in Ethiopia decided they would give up their U.S. assistance in order to spare women's lives. Imagine, as a result of this misguided policy, U.S. misguided  policy, the two largest family planning organizations in Ethiopia lost U.S. funds simply because they wanted to weigh in on a debate about reproductive health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things about President Bush that we all love is when he speaks about democracy and how democracy should be the centerpiece of our foreign policy. I ask you, what is democratic about gagging people? What is democratic about saying you have no right to free speech unless you agree with me? Then, if you agree with me, I support your right to speak. That is what the global gag rule is. Free speech is only allowed, under this administration, when that speech agrees with them. What is happening  as a result? Women are dying and there are unnecessary abortions. This is a terrible result of this policy. Basically, we say to people who are doing hard work to help their people: If you don't agree with us, gag it. If you don't gag it, you are not</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always thought that a legitimate democracy had the right to self-determination, that they were not punished if they said what they thought. We are not talking about spending a penny of U.S. money for abortions abroad. That has been illegal since 1976. We are not talking about using one cent of U.S. money to pay for lobbying for abortions. That also has been illegal all those years. We are talking, again,  about gagging family planning organizations  that use their own money, in a legal way in the country in which they are present, to help women who desperately need help, to help children who are raped, to help children who are victims of incest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In both 2003 and 2005, this Senate debated this exact amendment, and it passed with bipartisan support on both occasions. Why am I back? Because, sadly, the Senate never took final action on those bills, so we need to go back again and back again and back again until there is a clear decision on this issue. That clear decision is America, the greatest democracy in the world, is not going to tell other countries they have to see everything the way a particular administration sees it. They should  have the right to make their own decisions. As a country that believes in democracy, free speech, and improving the health and well-being of people all over the world, it is time for us once and for all to do away with this harsh and cruel policy. The health and lives of millions of women depend on it, and that is why repealing this global gag rule is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a small matter; this is a large matter. In the bill currently on the floor of the Senate and in the House bill, some steps have been taken to ease the burden of the global gag rule. However, it really does not go the distance. The bill before us today tries to address it by allowing contraceptives to be provided by the United States to international family planning organizations that would otherwise be ineligible. But at the end of the day, these organizations are still gagged, they  still can't lobby for changes in the law in the countries in which they work. They still cannot even refer someone for an abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I take the case of the mother who walks into one of these clinics with a child who is the victim of rape or incest and the mother is desperate: Where can I take my child? Please tell me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't tell you because if we tell you, we are going to lose our funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the child is losing time here in a battle to save her health. That is shameful. That is not something to be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's face it, these organizations need the funding and they need the freedom to exercise the most basic rights of humankind: the rights to free speech and expression to try to change policies they think are fundamentally wrong. In  truth, we need family planning clinics to have open doors, not just to provide contraceptive services--which are so important--but to attend to all the aspects of reproductive health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell why I get so emotional about this issue. Approximately 500,000 women die from pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum complications every year--500,000. Think of your largest cities--500,000 women a year, 1 woman every single minute. This includes deaths from a horrific condition known as obstetric fistula, which occurs when women's bodies are too young or underdeveloped to give birth. In Ethiopia, this problem is particularly prevalent, where child marriage rates are extremely high  and some girls actually get married at 7, 8, and 9 years of age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that we as a country would do anything to harm access to comprehensive family planning is shameful. This is the 21st century. Even if you would never, ever want a member of your family to have an abortion, even if you would want a member of your family never to know that it even exists as an option, put aside your own feelings and allow other people to make their choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give a specific example of what happens when international family planning organizations are barred from speaking out against injustice in the countries in which they operate. I will tell you a story I have told on the floor before, a story that a nongovernmental organization leader from Nepal told us at a hearing I chaired in the Foreign Relations Committee in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like so many nonprofits, this NGO was forced to make an impossible decision when faced with the unjust imprisonment of a 13-year-old girl named Min Min. What did Min Min do? A 13-year-old girl--why was she in prison? Because she was raped by her uncle. A relative took her for an abortion, and instead of going after the uncle, they put her in jail; a 13-year-old girl, sentenced to 20 years in jail. But because of this outrageous gag rule, the organizations that operated inside Nepal were faced  with a horrific choice: They would either lose their funding or they would keep their mouths shut and not try to free Min Min and change the laws. Do you know what they did? They gave up the money and they struggled, but they did the right thing, because</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that the kind of country we are, that we would tie the hands of an organization that wants to help that child and tell them: If you try to help that child and change the laws here, you lose your American funding. Doesn't that make us proud as Americans? No, it doesn't. It certainly doesn't make me proud. I hope it doesn't make anyone proud who would vote on this important amendment later on today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I praise that nongovernmental organization, that health care agency for saying: You know what, it is not worth the money; it is not worth the money. These countries have people in them who struggle for money. This child celebrated her 14th birthday in prison, her 15th birthday in prison, but because that health care organization, that NGO, was able to change the laws, Min Min was set free. That organization lost $100,000 in funding because they saved a child, and they had to let 60 staff members  go. That meant stopping a program that reached more than 50,000 people in remote communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are we doing? What are we about? Are we about helping families? Oh, we hear it all the time: family values. I have them. I want to help that mom who walks into a clinic with a pregnant 11-year-old girl who was raped. I don't want to punish the people who help her. I don't see how you stand for family values if you do that. It doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing by keeping the gag rule in place is saying to clinics and doctors: You have to choose between helping the people in your country by speaking out, by offering them referrals and counseling, or American dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a good policy for this country. This is a shameful policy for this country. I am very optimistic that, again, we will have a successful vote to overturn this global gag order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush says he will veto it. Let's have the debate. Let's have the debate because I think any moderate, sensible American will say this policy is misguided, and at the end of the day women and children are being hurt by it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time. I would ask how much time I have remaining.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, in the time I have allotted, I would like to respond to some of the arguments put forward by my colleague from California, who is a tremendous advocate on the cause and the case. We certainly see it a different way, different light. There is a term that is starting to move around the world a fair amount today because they are seeing it in practice. The term is called gendercide. It is a product of family planning institutions in places, particularly, such as China  and India. There are laws in India, particularly, that you cannot reveal the sex of a child in utero because so many of the female babies are being killed. Even then they are not working as laws. The people doing the sonograms will wink or nod to tell whether it is a girl or a boy child. And if it is a girl child, a lot of times the parents will go on and go forward with an abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has a result and effect that is taking place--normal balance ratios. You normally have a few more male children born than female children. In China your average now is 115 males  born per 100 females. In some areas in China the ratio is 120 to 130 males to 100 females in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, my own experience with adopting a child from China, Jenna--Jenna, a joy in our household. And if you go into a Chinese orphanage, it is virtually all female children in a Chinese orphanage. There will be some male children. They are the ones who have some physical, sometimes mental difficulties, but otherwise it is all girls in the orphanage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague talks about that women are dying through these policies. Yes, they are dying through these policies. Female children around the world are being killed through these policies. Female babies are being left at orphanages or other places around the world because of these policies. I think that is a powerful indictment of a system that still forces abortions on people, still forces people to have forced sterilizations. I do not think we should be anywhere around these. That is why the  second bill, on the Kemp-Kasten, I hope would pass the body nearly unanimously because it is about forced abortion and forced sterilization that is taking place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues may say, well, I do not think it still goes on. I mentioned an article. I only read a piece of the quote in it, but I wanted to read further in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Radio Free Asia reported this year that dozens of women in a small city in a central province in China were forced to have abortions because local officials failed to meet their population targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From a report in Radio Free Asia:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one province thousands of farmers rioted in May after family planners levied huge fines against people with too many children. Those that didn't pay were told their homes would be demolished and their belongings seized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is in an AP article and reported by Radio Free Asia. In that second amendment I put forward, we are saying: We do not want any part of this. We do not want any part of an organization that does support this. We do not want to support a coercive family policy in China. We do not want to associate with any organization that does. I would hope all of my colleagues would say: I do not want to see or be a part of anything like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from California talks about us gagging other people. They are free, organizations in every country are free as they want to be to advocate any policy they want to. We just do not want to fund it. We do not need to fund it. If they want to advocate different abortion policies, that is fine. We do not have to pay for it, and we should not pay for it, on something that is so controversial here and there. These are policies that are controversial in other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we dispute over the money, let's use the money to fight malaria or AIDS or tuberculosis. We will all agree on doing that. We do not gag them. They can do whatever they want. People in those countries get it too. If the United States is funding them, we are funding that voice. We are associated with that voice. I agree there are terrible things that happen in various parts around the world. But these abortion policies are not something that we should be supporting or funding, with its controversy  here and there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a basic right around the world, a basic right that I think trumps all other rights. It is the right to life. It is the right to live. Why would we support policies, promote organizations that are promoting policies that are opposed to that very basic right? If you do not get that one, any of the others do not matter a whole lot, do they? If you do not get to live, if you continue to have the kind of gendercide and gender imbalances in various countries taking place, you are not going  to have the voices there. You are not going to have the female voices that are there because they are being killed. This is happening in our world today. We do not need to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a thought--it is a Proverb actually that says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it is death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One can argue for the saying: Well, OK, this is right for us to do. We need to support family planning. I do not think so. I do not think that is the right way. There are ones who could look at this and say: This is about women's rights and we should use this for women's rights. I do not think you have to support abortion or abortion provider organizations to support women's rights. I think we can do that through other means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at the end of the day what this does, and what these policies do, is it ends in death. This ends in the death of a lot of children. The numbers are there, and they are huge. They are the ones we should not be associated with. So I would ask again, my colleagues, on Kemp-Kasten to support this language that we would not fund any organizations or support any groups that support forced abortion and involuntary sterilization. That one I do not think anybody should disagree with, and that we should  reinsert the Mexico City language that we will not support organizations that directly or indirectly support abortion or lobby for abortion. These are matters that countries there should take care of. If these provisions remain in the bill, the bill is not going to become law, and it will be back to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="REMOVAL OF CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I think this debate has been a good one, and Senator Brownback and I are used to debating this issue. I think we lay out our case the best we can. But let me be clear. I deplore gendercide. I am the mother of a daughter. I would do anything to protect her. I deplore hurting girls. I deplore hurting women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is so difficult for me to understand my friend's position on the Mexico City global gag rule policy. If he says he deplores hurting women, hurting children, hurting girls, then why would he support a policy that would punish a health care organization operating abroad from using its own funds to protect women, girls, children, families? Why would he support that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says: Oh, we are not gagging anybody. They can say anything they want. They just will not get our money. Well, this is America. We help people who are doing good things. That is the reason at one time we were beloved in the world. Is it not a good thing to help an organization that is using its own funds to help girls and women, to protect an 11-year-old who was raped to make sure she gets the health care she needs? Would not we want to think that American funding should help get contraceptives  to families abroad? Should we help them if they have an unintended pregnancy or a rape or incest in their family?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I do not understand how my friend's rhetoric matches his actions. I think it is cruel to continue the global gag rule. I think it is cruel to punish an organization that had to give up all of its money and all of its staff to go to work to change the law, to free a young girl who was raped by her uncle, and instead of the uncle going to jail, because of the laws in Nepal at that time, the child went to jail, and had her 14th and 15th birthday in jail and could have had 18 more years  in jail had the organization not walked away from U.S. funding. How does that make you feel as an American? It makes me feel very sad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then my colleague says he agrees that women are dying from these policies. But he does not define what are "these policies." Well, let me define these policies. Women are dying because of Mexico City language, because of the global gag rule known as Mexico City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read from the New Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The destructiveness of the gag rule is hard to overstate. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 500,000 women in developing countries die each year from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Of those, roughly 70,000 die from back-alley abortions. And aid restrictions have hurt those groups best positioned to help. In Kenya, for example, two health organizations have had to shut down their clinics since 2001 after proving unable to abide by the gag rule and losing their USAID  funding. Many of these clinics were the sole providers of health care for women and children in their respective regions, and most had offered post-abortion care--critical in a country where abortion is illegal, unsafe, and causes an estimated one-third of maternal deaths annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine a clinic had to shut down its doors because America withheld its funding. They could not afford to keep it open. And women came crying into the front door there, bleeding from back-alley abortions. This is something my friend speaks about as being humane and kind and good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, today the Senate has a chance to take a stand against the global gag order. The Senate has a chance to express itself in favor of the health of women, of girls. I am proud to be offering this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="REMOVAL OF CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the history of our financial commitment to United Nations peacekeeping should be a cautionary tale. For instance, from 1988 to 1994, U.N. peacekeeping spiraled out of control as the number of operations more than tripled and costs soared from $268 million to $3.5 billion. Finally, in 1994, the Democratically controlled Congress and President Clinton enacted legislation unilaterally reducing the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget from 31 percent to 25 percent.  The annual U.S. peacekeeping bill fell from almost $1 billion to around $300 million back in 1997. With the historic Helms-Biden U.N. agreement, we managed to clear up our fair share of arrears in exchange for much needed reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress later agreed to a glidepath in our peacekeeping assessment rate, still maintaining the 25-percent cap in law but permitting higher authorized levels as we worked to achieve that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the United States recognized our assessment at 25 percent; the same as the year before. Now in a Democratically controlled Congress, there is suddenly a push to roll back this achievement. It is estimated that for 2007, each percentage point over the cap costs U.S. taxpayers $50 million per year. There is no way the United States should pay a penny more than the 25-percent assessed contribution rate. Despite scandal after scandal, the U.N. has neglected to adopt any reforms that would  address the abuse, misconduct, mismanagement, and corruption that have plagued its peacekeeping operations and the body as a whole. United Nations peacekeepers are reported to have committed such egregious crimes as the rape and forced prostitution of the women and young girls they are</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United Nations cannot even spend the billions of dollars they receive now in a manner that is above reproach. According to the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight, from the audit of $1 billion in U.N. peacekeeping contracts over a 6-year period, $298 million was subject to waste, fraud, and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this amendment that would actually keep our assessment rate at the 25-percent rate instead of what is in the bill, raising it to 27.1 percent. I personally think we should decrease it even further, but the least we should do is keep it at the 25-percent rate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>No government today poses a greater threat to the United States, indeed, to the Middle East and probably to the world, than the Islamic Republic of Iran. We are all aware of the belligerent international behavior of the Iranian regime, its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, its use of Islamist terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban, to undermine moderate governments across the Middle East, its designation by the United States State Department as the No. 1 state  sponsor of terror and, of course, its escalating proxy war against American troops and Iraqi civilians and military in Iraq, where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been training, arming, equipping, and directing terrorists who are responsible in turn for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers and the murder of thousands of Iraqi civilians and soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What may, I fear, be less appreciated is that Iran's extremist terrorist behavior abroad is matched by equally extremist behavior at home. Just as the Iranian regime has been supporting the forces of repression and terror against the people of Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan, it is also escalating a campaign of repression and terror against its own citizens, the people of Iran. As the New York Times reported yesterday, the Iranian Government has in recent months "arrested prominent  intellectuals, suppressed the Iranian student movement, rolled back social freedoms, purged university faculties, [and] closed newspapers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This assault on Iranian civil society has been well documented by the most prominent international human rights nongovernmental organizations. Amnesty International, for instance, reports that "in recent months, the Iranian authorities have been carrying out a widespread crackdown on civil society, targeting academics, women's rights activists, students, journalists and labor organizations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dissidents and democrats in Iran today are under attack by their own Government. The question before this  Congress is whether we are going to stand with them in solidarity or whether we will turn away our heads. This amendment would provide $75 million in funds, the amount requested by the administration; in fact, announced by Secretary of State Rice. That announcement, I know from sources I have, was broadly heard and appreciated within the Iranian  civil society dissident movement. The committee has recommended one-third of that amount of money. This $75 million would go to labor activists, women's groups, journalists, human rights advocates, and other members of Iranian civil society. It provides Congress an opportunity</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The alternative path before Congress, if we don't adopt this amendment, would be to cut the administration's request by two-thirds. At that level of funding, existing programs will not only be unable to expand, they will actually be cut back. In other words, at just the moment when the Iranian Government is engaged in an unprecedented rollback of the human rights and political freedoms of the Iranian people, the American Government will be rolling back its own programs to help defend those rights  and freedoms. Why would we do this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report language of the Appropriations subcommittee, I say respectfully, says that "the Committee supports the goals of promoting democracy in Iran," but "it is particularly concerned that grantees suspected of receiving U.S. assistance have been harassed and arrested by the Government of Iran for their pro-democracy activities."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In other words, the argument against this amendment seems to be that we should give less to help dissidents in Iran because our help, in turn, may lead to their harassment by the totalitarian government in Tehran. I respectfully disagree with this logic. I know that we do not give less to democracy advocates in Myanmar or Zimbabwe or Belarus when they are being harassed by the regime, nor do we give less to freedom fighters behind the Iron Curtain in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and  Hungary. On the contrary, it is precisely when dissidents are under attack that they need more help from the United States, not less. I am sure my colleagues would agree that if we give less money to these civil society human rights activists in Iran, the Iranian regime will not repress them any less. The repression probably, in fact, will be greater. As to the argument that those who accept this money--and I</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the State Department began making these grants 8 months ago, 90 percent of the fiscal year 2006 funds have been obligated, with the remaining funds expected to be obligated by mid-September. Perhaps there are some Iranian groups that do not want our funding, but it is clear that many others do. The need is great. It is beyond the $75 million this amendment would provide. That choice should be theirs. Our moral responsibility is to make the money available to these courageous fighters for  freedom in Iran, those who want not only more freedom but a better future for themselves and their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to close by saying that we know from history that dissidents can change history, because history is made not by abstract, inexorable forces but by individual human beings such as Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa or Andrei Sakharov or Natan Sharansky. It was the bravery of these people that kindled our moral imagination to see the suffering of millions behind the Iron Curtain, and it was their leadership that inspired millions more to cast off their shackles and overthrow a cruel and dictatorial  system of Communist government that many thought would endure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>forever. Like the Communist terrorists of eastern Europe, the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran repress their people because they are frightened of them. They know how powerful the dissidents and the democrats in their midst can become. These are the people to whom this money would go. That is the reason my colleagues and I have offered this amendment.</paragraph>
