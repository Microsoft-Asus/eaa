    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, following any time used by the leaders, there will be a 60-minute period of morning business. The majority will control the first half hour and the Republicans will control the second half hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following this period of morning business, we will resume consideration of the immigration legislation. The next amendment to be offered this morning will come from the Republican side. Yesterday, I announced that the next Democratic amendment will be that of Senator Bingaman relating to the guest worker program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members can expect votes throughout the session today on the immigration bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I had a meeting with Senator Kennedy this morning. He indicated he would like to work into the evening on amendments. So Senators should plan to be here until at least 8 o'clock tonight with votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are making progress on the supplemental. It is not done yet, but we are very close.</paragraph>
