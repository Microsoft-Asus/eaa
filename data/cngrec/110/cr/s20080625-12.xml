  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr President, I rise today to recognize Bob Stoldal, a legend in Nevada news and the Las Vegas community for more than 40 years. Mr. Stoldal's first experience in a news office came in 1960, working for the Las Vegas Review Journal--first as a janitor, then as a typesetter. In the next year he was hired by KLAS radio as a graveyard-shift radio disk jockey, where he was known to his listeners as Bob Free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past five decades, Mr. Stoldal has worked as a reporter, anchor, news director, and vice president of news for KLAS. He was the first ever general manager of Las Vegas One and held that position for the past 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob's dedication to accuracy in media content and high ethical standards in broadcast journalism have defined his career. He demands journalistic excellence and integrity from himself and those who work for him. Bob's demand for excellence has earned KLAS countless national and regional awards and recognitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Besides upping the ante for Nevada journalism, Bob Stoldal has impacted the field on a national level. Mr. Stoldal has been a staunch advocate for cameras in courtrooms and pioneered the charge to allow cameras in southern Nevada's courtrooms, adding a degree of public scrutiny to our legal system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Stoldal's dedication to Las Vegas and his community extends far beyond the realm of media. Bob Stoldal has donated countless hours to the public good, working on State and local boards, commissions, and museums. He currently serves as chairman of the Nevada State Museum and Historical Society and the Las Vegas Historic Preservation Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Nevada Broadcasting Hall of Fame and the longest serving employee of KLAS, Bob Stoldal is a legend in the field of journalism; his insight, dedication, and integrity will be missed by all. I wish him an enjoyable retirement and all the best in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
