  <narrative>TANKER CONTRACT DECISION BAD FOR AMERICAN ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5490]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. MOORE of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400282" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Air Force's recent decision to award a contract to Airbus to replace our current fleet of aerial refueling tankers is a reckless one. Americans are experiencing job cuts, a credit crisis, foreclosures on their homes, and rising foods and energy prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just weeks after this Congress passed a $168 billion economic stimulus package to address these issues, the Air Force assumes it will simply appropriate $40 billion for an Airbus fleet of tankers, creating high-paying jobs in Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American workers have built and provided our tanker fleet for more than 40 years. Their experience makes them second to none when it comes to meeting this need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is beyond belief that the Air Force will reward American know-how and hard work by offshoring defense-related jobs and shrinking the U.S. industrial base even further. This decision is not in the interests of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to see the larger picture here. Congress has a responsibility to look out for all of the issues pertaining to this contract and the threat it poses to American workers.</paragraph>
