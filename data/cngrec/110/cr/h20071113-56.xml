  <narrative>CORPORAL STEVEN SHULZ, TEXAS MARINE -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13828]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Steven Shulz joined the United States Marine Corps after 9/11 and wanted, as he said, "to strengthen the United States military."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did two tours of duty in Iraq, and in 2005 he was wounded by an IED in Fallujah. He had traumatic brain injury and was given up for dead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last rites were actually given for him. But Corporal Shulz refused to die, even though he has permanent brain injury, a weak left side, and is blind in one eye. No one ever expected Steven to even walk; but he continues to go through rehab, and his recovery is remarkable due to awesome medical personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a ceremony at the Baylor College of Medicine on Veterans Day, Corporal Shulz was presented with keys to a new home, especially designed and built for him, thanks to Houston area Rotary Clubs and benefactors in the Houston area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a thrill for me and other Members of Congress to be present to see this young American hero. I was so impressed by his positive attitude and his love for America. He told me he would go back to Iraq and do it all over again if necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amazing men, these young guns of the United States Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
