  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to the growing chorus, in the Senate and across the world, supporting Senate ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have made great strides towards eradicating blatant discrimination based on race or social class in our country, far too many women around the world continue to face oppression and violence simply because of their gender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it may be easy to believe that this only is a foreign problem, one that does not exist in our homes, this is simply not the case. An estimated 30 percent of American women experience some form of assault in their lifetime. And even if women do not experience violence, discrimination can take many other forms. Hundreds of millions of women across the globe are living their lives facing oppression. Despite all the advancements towards social equality, there still exists a strong undercurrent  of gender-based prejudice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond simply striking it from our laws, we must also strike it from our hearts and demonstrate that ending discrimination means recognizing basic rights. All women should have access to health care. All women should have access to education. And all women should be allowed to live their lives free of fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has always represented a beacon of hope and opportunity to oppressed peoples around the world. While our Nation is among the best in ensuring equal rights and opportunities to women, we must never grow complacent in this constant struggle or believe that we have conquered sex-based discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I believe it is so important that the Senate ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Ratification of this Convention represents a step towards empowerment, not just of American women but women everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ratification also presents an opportunity to reassert American values to the world. At a time when our Nation's image abroad is under assault and our commitment to fundamental human rights and norms has been questioned, it is critical that we reaffirm our repudiation of discrimination in all forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The full realization of women's rights is vital to the development and well-being of people of all nations. The United States becoming a member of this convention is an important step toward that reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for the prompt ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</paragraph>
