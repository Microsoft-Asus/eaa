    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="2828">H.R. 2828</bill>) to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998, as amended.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this bill. The legislation before us recognizes one of the most tragic and unfortunate incidents in the history of the Department of State. It has been more than 9 years since the brutal bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania occurred. Twelve Americans perished in these terrorist attacks, and many other foreign nationals did in both of the attacks. These murders marked the true beginning of the war on terror, when al Qaeda targeted innocent Americans abroad  merely because of their association with our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of those twelve victims, five were foreign service officers including Julian Bartley, Sr., the Deputy Chief of Mission, and his young son who was interning at the Embassy when al Qaeda struck. I had visited the Embassy just several weeks before and had a conversation with Julian and knew him personally even as he worked here on the Hill before going to Kenya.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was later determined in an official accountability report that the security arrangements at the Nairobi Embassy were inadequate, as were the State Department's risk assessment procedures. The Nairobi Embassy was not classified as a hardship post. It was maddening to learn that the Ambassador in Nairobi had pleaded with the Department for additional security measures, but to no  avail. Worse, upon returning to the United States, many of the relatives  of those killed were treated dismissively by the Department of State. The expression "pouring salt on a wound" does not do justice to the bureaucratic manner in which the government addressed the relatives' claims. It was truly a disgrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The families of the victims are still awaiting sufficient compensation. The fact that this tragedy occurred so far away should not undermine the care given to the victims' families, whose lives will be forever altered by this incident. No amount of money will bring back those loved ones. However, in cooperation with Representative Jackson, our committee is making an effort to ensure that the families have some added degree of comfort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is also intended to send a message to the State Department: protect your employees; and God forbid, if incidents like this occur again, be attentive and sensitive to the families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will create a new program whereby the Secretary of State or the head of a relevant agency may compensate the relatives of a U.S. Government employee killed in an act of international terrorism up to eight times the individual's salary. The program would include foreign service nationals. It will also require the Secretary of State to retroactively compensate those U.S. Government employees killed in an act of terrorism since 1998, which would include the 12 victims in the Nairobi  attack. Those victims will receive an award commensurate with the total aid package available to a victim of terror today under this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It saddens me that such legislation is necessary, but I am heartened that perhaps this legislative act will bring some small degree of closure to the families of the Nairobi bombing victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on August 7, 1998, American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were the target of almost simultaneous terrorist bombings, killing hundreds and wounding thousands of people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among those killed were 12 American Embassy employees and dozens of foreign service nationals. These public servants paid with their lives while performing their duties, and it is our responsibility to ensure that their families receive proper compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support <bill type="h" number="2828">H.R. 2828</bill>, introduced by my distinguished colleagues Congressman Jackson and our Republican whip, Roy Blunt, which provides compensation to the families of the United States Embassy employees who perished due to acts of international terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill increases the death gratuity for foreign service officers and foreign national employees. It also authorizes additional compensation to family members of foreign service employees or government executive branch employees killed as a result of an act of international terrorism. It also requires the Secretary of State to provide compensation to foreign service employees killed in an act of international terrorism that occurred from 1998 to the date of the enactment of this act, including  the victims of the Nairobi bombing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and provide proper compensation to the families of the United States Embassy employees killed by brutal acts of international terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the majority whip, JIM CLYBURN, who assisted greatly in helping to move this bill forward through the Congress; and others, SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, who had a very strong interest in this legislation. We had been dealing with this for some time, ever since the tragedy occurred; and we have been looking forward to a vehicle that we could bring this very important legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And so we really are appreciative of the fine work of Mr. Clyburn and the principal sponsor of the legislation in the Appropriations Committee, Representative JESSE L. JACKSON, Jr., Second District of Illinois, a member of the Appropriations Committee, who put in tireless effort to bring this legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank you, Chairman Payne, for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2828">H.R. 2828</bill>, a bill to compensate relatives of U.S. citizens killed in the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced this bill with Republican Whip ROY BLUNT, and it has solid bipartisan support, including 19 members of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 7, 1998, an al Qaeda truck bomb exploded at the American embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and in Nairobi, Kenya. The embassy bombing in Nairobi killed 12 Americans serving their government. The Americans killed in the embassy bombings were, and Mr. Blunt will now join me in calling their names, Sergeant Nathan Aliganga, United States Marine Corps; Consul General Julian Bartley; his son, Jay Bartley; Jean Rose Dalizu; Molly Huckaby Hardy; Staff Sergeant Kenneth Hobson II.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the sponsor of the bill for not only allowing me to cosponsor it with him, but for allowing me today to assist and recognize the 12 individuals whose lives were lost in this terrible attack on our embassies. And let me do that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, Prabhi Kavaler, Arlene Kirk, Dr. Louise Martin, Michelle O'Connor, Master Sergeant Sherry Lynn Olds from the Air Force, and Tom Shah.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="">
    <paragraph>The State Department was negligent in not responding to concerns raised about the danger and exposure of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi to a vehicle bomb attack. The U.S. intelligence community had been surveilling several al Qaeda associates in Nairobi for 2 years, yet that information was not shared with the diplomats bidding on assignments in Nairobi, Kenya. Prior to the attack, then-U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell warned the State Department about the vulnerability  of the Nairobi Embassy and requested more security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of al Qaeda were convicted of the bombing in New York Federal District Court in 2001. Government witnesses at the trial testified that intelligence and security reports from several different sources had confirmed the presence of an al Qaeda cell in Nairobi and the likelihood that the location of the embassy exposed the employees to an attack given the proximity of the street, but the State Department failed to act on these intelligence reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Accountability Review Board, established to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the embassy bombings, found that the bombings were the result of a "collective failure of several administrations and Congresses over the past decade to invest adequate efforts and resources to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. diplomatic missions around the world to terrorist attacks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the families of those killed on 9/11, the families compensated in <bill type="h" number="2828">H.R. 2828</bill> also suffer a similar heartache and pain from an al Qaeda attack on U.S. soil. Several of the victims' children still suffer from serious emotional problems. However, unlike quick action taken by Congress and the executive branch to respond to the needs of families of 9/11, these families have waited more than 9 years without any meaningful compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Secretary of State Albright has stated publicly that her administration failed to help the families because the attacks happened thousands of miles away and because the Department failed to respond to the pre-attack intelligence report of the serious threat of the al Qaeda organization in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Mr. Speaker, this bill is the very least that a grateful Nation can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Republican Whip ROY BLUNT and his staff member, Brian Diffel, for working with us on this bill. I would also like to thank CBC Chairwoman KILPATRICK and her staff member, James Williams; DAN BURTON and his staff member, Brian Fauls, as well as the committee staff of Chairman Lantos, Chairman Payne and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for all the work they did on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the work of Karen Williams, counsel for the Nairobi Embassy families, and especially Consul General Bartley's daughter, Edith, who has brought this issue to the attention of the Congress and has worked tirelessly to get us to where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, present with us today in the House are members of the Bartley family, members of Ms. Kavaler's family, and members of the Kirk family. And I understand that it's not appropriate or within House rules to acknowledge specifically their location in the House Chamber, but they are here today on this momentous occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time. I urge an "aye" vote on <bill type="h" number="2828">H.R. 2828</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished minority whip, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the original cosponsor of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Poe for the good work he has done on this legislation and the recognition today to be allowed to speak for a few minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 7 of 1998, al Qaeda launched a devastating and meticulously coordinated attack on American people residing in foreign countries, but on American soil because they were at our embassies. On that day, 12 Americans and 200 Kenyans were killed at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, and another 11 lives were taken at Dar es Salaam, the former capital of Tanzania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though other indications existed, these bombings represented the clearest signs to date that Osama bin Laden had declared war on our country and its people. It was a declaration that fell largely on deaf ears, as my good friend, Mr. Jackson, just pointed out and has been acknowledged by our government. Had we been paying closer attention to that declaration, it's possible that we could have been more prepared for the terrible attacks that day and those attacks that came just 3 years  later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today speaks to an issue I've been working on since 2002 when, at the time, I introduced and the House passed the Embassy Victims Compensation Act. At that time, my good friend Maxine Waters was my cosponsor and an active advocate in dealing with this issue, and the House as a whole stepped forward and dealt with this issue, now 5 years ago. It was our first effort at that time to recognize the profound sacrifices made by those Americans that have been mentioned  here today, and just as important, that their families made and continue to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we take a step toward completing the work this House started 5 years ago. The families of those who lost so much at the hands of al Qaeda deserve this bill, and I'm proud to have been involved in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to especially thank Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., who has helped make this bill happen this year. He took up the mantle of the hard work that needed to be done; he was tireless in insisting that our Nation deal with this issue and deal with it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with Jesse Jackson, I would like to recognize the incredible and patient work of Edith Bartley, who lost her father and her brother in the Nairobi attack. For almost a decade now, she has worked to point out the sacrifices made by our State Department personnel, as well as some of the shortcomings of that agency's treatment of her family and others both before and after the attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, nothing we do today can replace those who were lost nearly a decade ago, but I'm hopeful that this effort, if nothing else, will demonstrate that we have not forgotten those who died in this horrific attack. And we will never forget the enduring lessons that we've learned from it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlelady from the 35th District of California, chairperson of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, Congresswoman Maxine Waters.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much for yielding this time to me, Congressman Payne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rushed from my last appointment to be here because this is a day that we have waited for far too long. And I certainly appreciate all of the work that you have done, and certainly the work of Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., and the work of Members on both sides of the aisle. And Congressman Blunt is correct; we did coauthor this legislation I think some 6 years ago, but we have only been able to stick with this legislation because of one person, in my estimation, and that  is Edith Bartley. She has walked these halls. She has lobbied. She has educated us. She has always been pleasant. She has been patient and cooperative. You couldn't have a better daughter. You couldn't have a better child. You couldn't have a better family member not only looking out for the family, but for all of the families who have not yet been treated fairly and compensated for what happened to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as it was said, 9 years ago, on August 7, 1998, terrorists affiliated with al Qaeda bombed United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. These terrorist attacks were one of the first warnings of the threat posed by al Qaeda, the international terrorist organization that hijacked American airplanes and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11 6 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The embassy bombings in Nairobi killed over 200 United States Embassy employees, 12 of whom were United States citizens, and injured thousands more. The embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania killed 11 employees and injured over 80 people. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 killed nearly 3,000 innocent people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Government provided compensation to the families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that the United States be consistent and provide compensation to the families of the victims of the embassy bombings in East Africa 3 years earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. I offer my apology and the apology of many others because it has taken so long. My sympathies to the families of the victims of those embassy bombings, as well as all of the victims of al Qaeda's acts of terror. Let us move forward so that we can finally do the right thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me once again commend the combined effort on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, this has been lingering ever since it occurred. I recall meeting with the family, very devastated by the event, but I do recall, too, that the manner in which the Department of State dealt with the issue was in very, very poor taste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The family persisted. And all of the families that suffered I'm sure today are pleased that the recognition for what their family members, those who joined the Foreign Service, those who said that they wanted to contribute their careers to serving the United States of America on foreign soils in diplomatic ways. And so we are extremely pleased that this bill has finally come to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I, too, commend Ms. Bartley, who has been in my office year in and year out in a pleasant and very persistent manner. As Congresswoman Maxine Waters said, she is just a gem for anyone to have as their daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2828">H.R. 2828</bill>, to provide compensation to relatives of United States citizens who were killed as a result of the bombings of United States embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998. I would like to commend my colleague, Congressman JESSE JACKSON, JR., for introducing this important and long-overdue legislation, and I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Congressman LANTOS, for  his leadership on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been pleased to work with Congressman JACKSON, and to cosponsor this bill, because I strongly believe that the relatives of the victims of the 1998 East Africa bombings have gone too long without the recognition and the compensation they need and deserve. I was also pleased to work with the Chairman of the Committee, Congressman LANTOS, to ensure that these families receive what they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as you are well aware, in 1998 simultaneous bombs exploded at United States embassies in the East African capital cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. These attacks, which killed hundreds of people, first brought international attention to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network, and stand out as one of the worst anti-American terrorist attacks preceding September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, nearly a decade later, the families of those victims who died in these bombings still have not been compensated. In contrast, after the catastrophic events of September 11, Congress acted relatively quickly to set up the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, which paid out nearly $6 billion to 2,880 families of those injured on that catastrophic day. We have shown compassion toward those affected by terrorism, and we have shown that we can act with purpose and haste. It is now time  to finally act to compensate the families of those who died in East Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of the Kenya bombings, a 2001 bipartisan review panel found no negligence per se, but did find that there was an "institutional failure ..... to recognize threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicle bombs worldwide." The intelligence community had been monitoring several Al Qaeda associates in Nairobi for 2 years. That information was not shared with the diplomats bidding on assignments in Nairobi. Prior to the attack, then-Ambassador Prudence Bushnell warned the State  Department about the vulnerability of the embassy and requested more security. Instead of properly addressing Bushnell's concerns, State replied: "go back to Nairobi, don't send any more cables about this or we are going to place a statement in your personnel file."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this cavalier treatment of embassy officials in Africa, many of the relatives of those killed were treated dismissively by the State Department upon returning to the United States. Instead of compassion they found bureaucracy, and instead of recompense they found only red tape. Now, 9 years later, those families are still awaiting sufficient compensation. While no amount of money can bring back loved ones or heal the wounds this act of terrorism caused, we must make an effort to ensure  that the families receive some degree of comfort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would amend the Foreign Service Act to provide a death benefit to all U.S. Government employees abroad in U.S. diplomatic facilities who are killed in an act of international terrorism. It would retroactively require the Secretary of State to compensate those killed since 1998, including the Nairobi families, at ten times the salary of the highest paid employee in the embassy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation recognizes one of the most tragic and unfortunate incidents in the history of the Department of State. We have waited too long to bring recognition and compensation to the families of those who perished in these tragic bombings. I am pleased to have worked with these brave families to bring this legislation, with a full compensation package, before the Committee today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
