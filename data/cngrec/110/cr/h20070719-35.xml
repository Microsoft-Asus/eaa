  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have heard this week in publicized reports of the activities that are going on around the world with respect to al Qaeda. The National Intelligence Estimate has indicated publicly, nonclassified information, that this group is franchising. It means that they are able to spread without leadership around the world. And those who have followed the Iraq war recognize that it is a training ground for those terrorists who would then leave and spread their viciousness  around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard this week Prime Minister Maliki indicating that our soldiers could leave. He ultimately said he was misinterpreted. But, frankly, I believe, Mr. Speaker, it is time for our soldiers to be redeployed out of Iraq and that an appropriate and directed decision needs to move all of our soldiers home to America.</paragraph>
