    <paragraph>I thank Madam Speaker. This weekend, Senator John Edwards announced his opposition to the Peru Trade Agreement. The reason? As his statement says, "All of these agreements replicate the terrible features of NAFTA." Senator Edwards is right. It is more of the same old, same old. A leading Presidential candidate is saying it. The American people are sick of it. And so why is Congress pushing for it? Why would we push for a steady stream of lost jobs that gives incentives to multinational</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public aren't fooled. Campaign finance reform hasn't stopped the incredible financial influence of multinational corporations. These corporations are weighing in with the candidates, even Citibank. Take, for example, the provisions hidden in the Peru FTA. As Senator Edwards points out, "Buried deep in the 800-page text of the Peru FTA are ambiguous provisions that could allow U.S. banks to demand compensation if Peru reverses its disastrous social security privatization."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peru FTA contains provisions that could allow Citibank to demand compensation in FTA foreign investor protection tribunals from the Peruvian Government if Peru seeks to reverse its failed social security privatization. The Peruvian archbishop and both labor federation presidents asked the Ways and Means leaders to fix this problem. And it hasn't been fixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House floor will be voting on this in a couple of weeks. As a Democratic Party, we have stood united against privatization of Social Security. We have not backed down. That is why it shocks me to hear that Senator Obama supports the Peru FTA. Yes, Senator Obama does support the Peru FTA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Edwards has it right. It is time to stick up for the American workers. It is time to reject the same NAFTA model that has devastated our industry. It is time to listen to the broad list of groups who do not support the Peru FTA. Not one union, environmental, consumer, small business, faith, family farm group supports the modified Bush Peru NAFTA Expansion FTA. So why would any Presidential candidate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to hear what the candidates are saying about protecting our jobs and fighting for fair trade deals. It is important that we stick together in this fight to keep our jobs here at home. I encourage my colleagues to vote "no" on the Peru FTA.</paragraph>
