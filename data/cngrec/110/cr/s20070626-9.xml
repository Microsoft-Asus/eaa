  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, despite the fact that we are fast approaching the 6-year anniversary since the terrible terrorist attacks of September 11, it is painfully clear we have much work left  to do to protect this Nation from these awful attacks. Osama bin Laden and his No. 2 still remain at large, and al-Qaida has grown in strength and is determined to attack globally. The administration's failed Iraq policy has catalyzed a whole new generation of  extremists who can be expected to carry out attacks against the U.S. and our friends around the world. Objective analyses, including the final report of the 9/11 Commission, conclude that this Nation has failed to take the steps necessary to protect America from terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need only go back to look at the report card the Bush administration received in implementing the 9/11 Commission Report: Ds and Fs. The threats the 9/11 Commission talked about and are encompassed in this bill are real and growing. When Democrats took control of the Congress at the start of this year, we said we would finally and fully implement the unanimous recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. It is something we fought for when we were in the minority, and it was one of the  first bills we passed at the start of this session of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House passed its version early this year, January 9, by a vote of 299 to 128--broad bipartisan support. We passed our bill on March 13. It, too, had bipartisan support, passing 60 to 38.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, Democrats and Republicans who serve on the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over this bill have worked tirelessly to resolve the differences in these two bills. I have had numerous conversations with Chairman Lieberman. This preconference process has carried on for months, on a bipartisan basis, with full transparency and good-faith efforts to produce a final bill. Progress has been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people, though, don't expect progress. They expect results, and that is what we need. We need to finish the work on this bill yesterday--as soon as possible. That is why I believe we need to take the next procedural step to finish these negotiations, to appoint conferees. That is what we normally would do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this bill is finally signed into law, it will make America more secure. It will improve the morale, training, and efficiency of the TSA screening workforce, allowing them to work more effectively to protect air travelers. It will improve the screening of all maritime cargo--all maritime cargo--so Americans can be assured we are doing all we can to prevent the smuggling of weapons--even a nuclear weapon--through America's ports. It will improve the congressional oversight of intelligence  to be sure we are building the best capabilities possible to stop terrorist attacks. It will improve communication sharing and communications interoperability among first responders so they can work swiftly to protect us from terrorist attacks. It will ensure that transportation and mass transit infrastructures are hardened against terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to work together to protect the American people from terrorism, and we need to do so immediately. We asked numerous times in the last Congress to be able to finish the 9/11 bill, and we were denied that ability. I would hope that this unanimous consent request allowing us to go to conference would be granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am told the minority is going to object to this request that we go to conference. That is too bad. Although Senate Republicans have thrown procedural hurdles in front of virtually everything we have tried to do in the Senate this year, I was hoping they would reconsider their obstruction when it comes to getting through legislation that makes America more secure. There have been issues raised, but couldn't we handle these in conference?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, as passed by the Senate on March 13, 2007, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment,  request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the above occurring without intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on behalf of the minority, I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, we are glad to have you back. We are glad the medical procedure went well and that you are back with the same fighting spirit you had the first day you came here. We are happy to have you back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will renew my request at a subsequent time, and probably a few more times, until we get this done. I think a number of people have had calls from the 9/11 survivors, those people who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attack. They want us to get this done. We need to get this done. This is an issue that affects the safety and security of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would hope that there would be a reconsideration of this objection at a subsequent time because I am going to continue to offer this until we are able to go to conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
