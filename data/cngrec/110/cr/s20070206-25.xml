  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="RECOGNITION OF G. MARTIN WAGNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor G. Martin Wagner--a dedicated public servant who, on January 31, 2007, retired from Federal service after 31 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marty Wagner has had an exemplary career working for the Federal Government. Far removed from the apocryphal "faceless bureaucrat" that so many of those who wrongly belittle our Federal workforce often refer to, Marty should serve as an example to us all in how to best serve the people of this great country. Marty was a leader and a doer who accomplished much over the past three decades, and leaves the Federal Government a far better place than how he found it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over his 31 years in the Federal civil service, Marty earned many honors and awards for his efforts to make the Federal Government a better place to work for all Federal employees. His service has also resulted in a Federal Government that is more caring and responsive to the needs of the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marty grew up in Tucson, AZ. In his youth, he played guitar and sang folk songs in old time "hootenannies." He has a deep, recognizable voice, which would have served him well as a professional musician or radio persona. Fortunately for us, his career took a different path and Marty became a dedicated, hard-working Federal employee--serving in a number of agencies and departments over the past 31 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of us who know and have worked with Mr. Wagner over the years, associate him with his almost two decades of service with the General Services Administration, GSA, where he has been an innovative leader and promoter of initiatives for improved and more accessible information technology for Federal workers and the public alike. Most recently, Marty has served as Deputy Commissioner of the new Federal Acquisition Service, FAS. Prior to accepting this position, Mary also served as Acting Commissioner  and Acting Deputy Commissioner of FAS. However, Marty was also a leader before his days at GSA, and I call to my colleagues attention just one of his major accomplishments over his Federal career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early on, Marty was an economic analyst at the Environmental Protection Agency. His outstanding work in the environmental arena proved to be invaluable to the quality of the air we breathe. In addressing the economic impact of pending EPA regulations, Marty was instrumental in producing the findings that resulted in the first requirement to remove lead from gasoline. I believe Marty could have retired at this point and have served his country well but, fortunately, this was just the first step  in a long and distinguished career with the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>G. Martin Wagner was a masterful manager and leader of innovative change within the Federal Government. The results of his untiring efforts over the past 30 years are evident in numerous Federal programs, resulting in a much more effective and efficient Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Deputy Commissioner Wagner has been a leader for positive change and modernization. When you worked with Marty you knew where you stood and that his positions were based upon his strong personal beliefs in how best to serve the American public and the Federal employees that he managed and with whom he worked. He is an honest, straightforward individual who did not shy away from challenges and difficult issues but, rather, sought the middle ground of compromise while always  championing progress and better service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his work on implementing the gargantuan task of modernizing Federal telecommunications to his personal crusade of making sure each and every Federal worker was treated with respect and provided opportunities for advancement, Marty Wagner has always proved to be a capable and innovative leader. When we think of a government that is more efficient and effective, we need to pay our thanks to the good work of Deputy Commissioner Wagner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure that Marty's retirement from the Federal Government will not be the last we hear of him. Such an active, well-rounded, intelligent individual is not going to just while away the hours but, rather, seek out new challenges and opportunities to help his country and fellow citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>G. Martin Wagner and his good work will be missed but not forgotten.</paragraph>
