  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="STAFF SERGEANT ROBB ROLFING">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to SSG Robb Rolfing and his heroic service to our country. He was killed in action on June 30, 2007, by enemy small arms fire while on a mission near Baghdad. Robb was a member of the elite Green Berets as a special forces engineer to Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, Airborne, in Fort Carson, CO. Robb was on his second tour of duty when he was killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robb Lura Rolfing was born on December 4, 1977, to Rex and Margie Rolfing in Sioux Falls, SD. He grew up admiring "MacGyver," prompting him to start carrying duct tape everywhere he went.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before Robb became a soldier, he attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY, majored in physics and astronomy, and played soccer. During his time as captain on the Vassar soccer team, he took the team to Vassar's first ever NCAA tournament postseason playoff, in any sport, where he scored the winning goal in the first round of games. To further demonstrate his talent as a soccer player, he was named to the NSCAA/Adidas All-Region Team and the All-New York Team. A Vassar basketball coach told  the Rolfing family that he would often see Robb practicing soccer out on the field by himself in the morning and after regular scheduled practices. The coach said, "If I had 5 Robb's we would win every game because of the determination and focus he showed." After college, he went to work in field management at Rollins College in Winter Park, FL, and then moved on to coach soccer at Currey College in Boston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robb's mom Margie says that she has started a list called "Amazing Robb." This list is a compilation of stories, thoughts, and recollections that the family has gathered from family and friends of Robb. Margie recalls one particular moment when Robb's sister, Tiffany, was about to graduate from high school. The family thought that he was still overseas during his first tour, but he showed up at home wearing a blanket of Tiffany's college over his head just standing at the door. The only way  Tiffany recognized it was Robb was because of his shoes--he had them duct taped because he refused to buy new shoes as the ones with duct tape were far too comfortable to throw away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robb always wanted something more out of the life he was given. After the events of September 11, 2001, Robb's calling to help serve his country was jolted into action and he joined the Army in January of 2003. He completed his basic training at Fort Benning, GA, and was assigned to the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, KY. Shortly after returning from his first tour, he qualified and was accepted into the special forces unit where he became a Green Beret.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robb's good will and service touched the lives of many people. Although his life was cut short, he continues to inspire all those who knew him. Our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family of SSG Robb Rolfing. He will be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.</paragraph>
