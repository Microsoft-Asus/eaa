  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARIN HUMANE SOCIETY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the 100th anniversary of a wonderful organization in my home State of California, the Marin Humane Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Marin County Humane Society was founded on December 14, 1907, by Ethel H. Tompkins and a group of concerned citizens who wanted to find a solution to the plight of lost and abused animals. From its first animal shelter in the San Rafael stables in 1912, the organization has expanded its facilities to a four-building complex on a 7-acre campus. Today, the Marin Humane Society, which shortened its name in 1980, serves the community with 95 staff members and 800 volunteers.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="10412">S10412</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the dedicated work of the Marin Humane Society, 8,000 animals each year find refuge, rehabilitation, and loving homes. This has included efforts to rescue animals lost and injured in disasters, such as the Oakland firestorm of 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is particularly noteworthy that in 2005, the organization brought over 2,500 Hurricane Katrina animal victims to bay area shelters and out of harm's way through its rescue effort, "Orphans of the Storm." In partnership with commercial airlines, these pet airlifts were a first for the Nation and protected the lives of thousands of animals. Funded solely from private benefactors and coordinated by the Marin Humane Society, nine flights of lost animals arrived in the bay area in the 2 months  following the disaster. Additional flights carried animals to southern California, Oregon, and Washington, where other animal shelters and rescue groups agreed to offer refuge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Marin Humane Society's admirable milestones continued in 2006, when it adopted its 250,000th animal to a loving home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When in 1997 the Marin Humane Society staff felt they had made significant progress on controlling the pet overpopulation problem in Marin County, they decided to expand their services to neighboring counties through their Pet Partnership program. Volunteers brought thousands of dogs and cats from congested shelters in other communities to Marin to give them a second chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so pleased to acknowledge the Marin Humane Society's long and distinguished record of community service. Over the past century, the organization has educated children and adults on the importance of humane treatment of animals; provided comprehensive veterinary care and rehabilitation for neglected and abused animals; provided pet adoption services and dog training programs; and advocated for animal welfare policy on the local, State and Federal level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Marin Humane Society staff and volunteers for their compassion and commitment to protecting and caring for our society's lost, neglected, and abused animals. They do a tremendous service to the greater community and are deserving of the highest recognition for their large hearts and generous ways. Please join me in celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Marin Humane Society.</paragraph>
