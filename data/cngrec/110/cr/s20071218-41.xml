  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this chamber approved the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. I am particularly pleased with the inclusion of an important provision contained in section 846 of the legislation to modernize the whistleblower protections afforded to defense contractor employees. At a time when reports of fraud, waste, and abuse in defense contracts are rampant, it is absolutely vital that we have in place the types of whistleblower protections for contractor employees  that I will empower them in reporting such abuse and therefore will protect those who wish to protect American I taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senator COLLINS for working with me on this important provision and further thank Senators LEVIN and MCCAIN for their leadership and stewardship of this provision through the Senate and conference-considerations of the Defense Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the floor, however, to make one explanatory clarification as to the final language of this amendment because I think it critical that the record be clear as to the intent of the Congress. Last year in Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court canceled constitutional protection for speech made within the normal course of an employee's execution of his or her job duties, specifically because those disclosures are covered by other whistleblower statutes. There should be absolutely no confusion  that the Congress believes that the logic and holding of Garcetti is inapplicable to the defense contractor whistleblower protection statute, 10 U.S.C. 2409, as amended by section 846 of this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Disclosures taken to carry out job responsibilities, within the normal course of an employee's duties, are protected by this provision for three core reasons. First, they are essential preliminary steps for a responsible disclosure to the government. Second, often they in fact are indirect disclosures to Government inspectors, auditors, and investigators who must study associated internal corporate records to engage in informed oversight. Third, the purpose of whistleblower statutes is to reduce  waste. But waste would be maximized if employees had to avoid their own organizations and go straight to the Government in order to avoid waiving their whistleblower rights. The law's goal is maximized by employees being empowered to safely  work within their employment structure, as a first step,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my fellow Senators for joining Senator COLLINS and me in our efforts to protect whistleblowers and provide greater contractor accountability and oversight.</paragraph>
