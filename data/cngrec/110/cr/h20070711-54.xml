    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier today we passed the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, and I just want to take a minute to thank Congressman George Miller for his tremendous leadership in achieving bipartisan support for a bill that will have a positive and lasting impact on the future of education in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We raised the maximum Pell Grant, reaching $5,200 by 2011. In my home State of California, this will benefit over 645,000 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important part of this bill is the increase to the Upward Bound program, effective for the current fiscal year, allowing several program sites that had to shut their doors a few weeks ago to reopen, including one in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also makes landmark investments in our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, our Hispanic-serving institutions, and will raise the number of students obtaining degrees in science, technology and math, and increase the capacity of these institutions to teach in these fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's vote was a vote for the future of our children and for the future of our Nation.</paragraph>
