  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SKIP CARAY -- (Senate - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8945">S8945</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I mourn the passing and pay tribute to a great Georgian. Broadcaster Skip Caray passed away in his suburban Atlanta home on August 3, 2008, leaving a tremendous void in the hearts of Atlanta Braves fans nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After years of calling basketball and hockey games in St. Louis and Atlanta, Skip Caray began broadcasting for the Braves in 1976. Baseball was in his blood, and while their styles were different, Skip brought the same warmth and humor to his calls as his famous father, Harry, delivered to the Chicago Cubs for years. Skip Caray passed his love for the game on to his sons, Chip and Josh, both of whom found careers in the same profession as their father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a broadcaster for TBS, Skip Caray's voice was not only familiar to baseball fans in the South, but millions around the country. Whether it was the many years that the Braves spent in the depths of their division or the 14 consecutive seasons at the top, Caray provided the voice of a friend who shared the same passion for "America's Team" that the fans did. No Braves fan will ever forget Skip urging Sid Bream around third base and into the World Series in 1992 or his elation as the Braves  won it all in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Caray was elected to the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame. At his induction, his mentor, Ernie Johnson, Sr., said that Caray "had a bigger heart than anyone can imagine." Skip Caray will be sorely missed and will remain in Atlanta Braves fans' hearts forever.</paragraph>
