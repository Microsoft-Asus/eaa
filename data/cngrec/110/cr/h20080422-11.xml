    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to join in those sponsoring <bill type="hc" number="322">H. Con. Res. 322</bill>, celebrating the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel; and just minutes later in the White House, President Harry Truman signed the order so the U.S. would also recognize this new Jewish State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, the U.S. has had a close and special relationship with the State of Israel, shared democratic values and common strategic interests with the people of Israel and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Israel have fought costs of war, have fought terrorism, and diplomatic and economic boycotts, and still they remain committed to peace and security in their country and the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege to visit the country twice and witness the strength and resilience of the people of Israel. They are committed to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. In this thriving democracy, we need to continue that support and the commitment to the peace process, and I congratulate Israel on the 60th anniversary of their independence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
