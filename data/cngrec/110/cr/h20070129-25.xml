    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of announcing to the House that one of our most beloved former Members, Father Robert Drinan, has passed away. He served five terms in the House of Representatives, from 1971 to 1981. Those of us who served with him and those who came to know him subsequently through his work as an educator and a moral leader admired his lifelong commitment to public service, loved him for his friendship and will miss his remarkable spirit. He was truly a great  man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House be made in order so that we may observe a moment of silence in memory of Father Robert Drinan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members will rise and observe a moment of silence.</chair>
