  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="LANCE CORPORAL CAMERON M. BABCOCK">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Plymouth, IN. LCpl Cameron Babcock, 19 years old, died January 20th at Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California. Lance Corporal Babcock was killed as the result of a firearms accident in his barracks. Cameron was a committed soldier and servant to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cameron was a 2006 graduate of Plymouth High School and was a gifted musician. He played the trumpet in the Big Red Marching Band and was a member of the Plymouth High School Advanced Jazz Band. In 2005, he competed at the State Jazz Festival in LaPorte with the Advanced Jazz Band. He was also a member of the Wind Ensemble, comprised of some of the school's top music students. Cameron also played the guitar and enjoyed four-wheeling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation, Cameron fulfilled a lifelong goal by enlisting in the Marines, telling his family it was what he had always hoped to do. He was promoted to private first class after boot camp and was a rifleman in the infantry. With his assignment to Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Cameron served an exemplary tour in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a decorated soldier and received numerous awards during his tour in Iraq including the  National Defense Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon and the Certificate of Commendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cameron was awaiting his second tour of duty in Iraq when he died. He is survived by his parents, Jeffery and Ann Smith Babcock; his sisters Kailey, Abigail, and Hope Babcock; and his brother, Samuel Babcock. The Babcock family resides in Plymouth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Cameron's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Cameron. Today and always, Cameron will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the example he set in serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of LCpl Cameron M. Babcock in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Cameron's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Cameron.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Major Olmsted was a proud soldier whose sense of duty took him to Iraq--whose commitment to his fellow soldiers earned him their deepest respect--and whose compassion put him in the line of fire the day he died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Andrew was also an exceptionally talented writer. He shared his experiences and perspectives in Iraq with the world on blogs, including one he wrote for the Rocky Mountain News entitled "From the Front Lines." The thousands of readers who followed Andrew's deployment had the privilege of his frank, thoughtful, stirring, and often humorous take on the war, the Army, and politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a writer and reporter as gifted as Andrew, it is hard to find the words to properly honor his life and his sacrifice. I would rather let him speak for himself and reflect on his memory by sharing with my colleagues portions of Major Olmsted's final posting. He asked a friend to post this on his blog in the event of his death. In its eloquence, power, humor, and tragedy, it is one small way in which we may remember the mark that Andrew made on our world:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an entry I would have preferred not to have published, but there are limits to what we can control in life, and apparently I have passed one of those limits. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I don't want this to be is a chance for me, or anyone else, to be maudlin. I'm dead. That sucks, at least for me and my family and friends. But all the tears in the world aren't going to bring me back, so I would prefer that people remember the good things about me rather than mourning my loss. (If it turns out a specific number of tears will, in fact, bring me back to life, then by all means, break out the onions.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a pretty good life, as I noted above. Sure, all things being equal I would have preferred to have more time, but I have no business complaining with all the good fortune I've enjoyed in my life. So if you're up for  that, put on a little 80s music (preferably vintage 1980-1984), grab a Coke and have a drink with me. If you have it, throw "Freedom Isn't Free" from the Team America soundtrack in; if you can't laugh at that song, I think you need  to lighten up a little. I'm dead, but if you're reading this, you're not, so take a moment to enjoy that happy fact. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suppose I should speak to the circumstances of my death. It would be nice to believe that I died leading men in battle, preferably saving their lives at the cost of my own. More likely I was caught by a marksman or an IED. But if there is an afterlife, I'm telling anyone who asks that I went down surrounded by hundreds of insurgents defending a village composed solely of innocent women and children. It'll be our little secret, ok?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do ask (not that I'm in a position to enforce this) that no one try to use my death to further their political purposes. I went to Iraq and did what I did for my reasons, not yours. My life isn't a chit to be used to bludgeon people to silence on either side. If you think the U.S. should stay in Iraq, don't drag me into it by claiming that somehow my death demands us staying in Iraq. If you think the U.S. ought to get out tomorrow, don't cite my name as an example of someone's life who was  wasted by our mission in Iraq. I have my own opinions about what we should do about Iraq, but since I'm not around to expound on them I'd prefer others not try and use me as some kind of moral capital to support a position I probably didn't support. Further, this is tough enough on my family without their having to see my picture being used in some rally or my name being cited for some political purpose. You can fight political battles without hurting my family, and I'd prefer that you did so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a similar note, while you're free to think whatever you like about my life and death, if you think I wasted my life, I'll tell you you're wrong. We're all going to die of something. I died doing a job I loved. When your time comes, I hope you are as fortunate as I was. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who know me through my writings on the Internet over the past five-plus years probably have wondered at times about my chosen profession. While I am not a Libertarian, I certainly hold strongly individualistic beliefs. Yet I have spent my life in a profession that is not generally known for rugged individualism. Worse, I volunteered to return to active duty knowing that the choice would almost certainly lead me to Iraq. The simple explanation might be that I was simply stupid, and certainly  I make no bones about having done some dumb things in my life, but I don't think this can be chalked up to stupidity. Maybe I was inconsistent in my beliefs; there are few people who adhere religiously to the doctrines of their chosen philosophy, whatever that may be. But I don't think that was the case in this instance either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As passionate as I am about personal freedom, I don't buy the claims of anarchists that humanity would be just fine without any government at all. There are too many people in the world who believe that they know best how people should live their lives, and many of them are more than willing to use force to impose those beliefs on others. A world without government simply wouldn't last very long; as soon as it was established, strongmen would immediately spring up to establish their fiefdoms.  So there is a need for government to protect the people's rights. And one of the fundamental tools to do that is an army that can prevent outside agencies from imposing their rules on a society. A lot of people will protest that argument by noting that the people we are fighting in Iraq are unlikely to threaten the rights of the average American. That's certainly true; while our enemies would certainly like to wreak great levels</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soldiers cannot have the option of opting out of missions because they don't agree with them: that violates the social contract. The duly-elected American government decided to go to war in Iraq. (Even if you maintain President Bush was not properly elected, Congress voted for war as well.) As a soldier, I have a duty to obey the orders of the President of the United States as long as they are constitutional. I can no more opt out of missions I disagree with than I can ignore laws I think are  improper. I do not consider it a violation of my individual rights to have gone to Iraq on orders because I raised my right hand and volunteered to join the army. Whether or not this mission was a good one, my participation in it was an affirmation of something I consider quite necessary to society. So if nothing else, I gave my life for a pretty important principle; I can (if you'll pardon the pun) live with that. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I write this in part, admittedly, because I would like to think that there's at least a little something out there to remember me by. Granted, this site will eventually vanish, being ephemeral in a very real sense of the word, but at least for a time it can serve as a tiny record of my contributions to the world. But on a larger scale, for those who knew me well enough to be saddened by my death, especially for those who haven't known anyone else lost to this war, perhaps my death can serve as  a small reminder of the costs of war. Regardless of the merits of this war, or of any war, I think that many of us in America have forgotten that war means death and suffering in wholesale lots. A decision that for most of us in America was academic, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, had very real</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for those who knew me and feel this pain, I think it's a good thing to realize that this pain has been felt by thousands and thousands (probably millions, actually) of other people all over the world. That is part of the cost of war, any war, no matter how justified. If everyone who feels this pain keeps that in mind the next time we have to decide whether or not war is a good idea, perhaps it will help us to make a more informed decision. Because it is pretty clear that the average American  would not have supported the Iraq War had they known the costs going in. I am far too cynical to believe that any future debate over war will be any less vitriolic or emotional, but perhaps a few more people will realize just what those costs can be the next time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This may be a contradiction of my above call to keep politics out of my death, but I hope not. Sometimes going to war is the right idea. I think we've drawn that line too far in the direction of war rather than peace, but I'm a soldier and I know that sometimes you have to fight if you're to hold onto what you hold dear. But in making that decision, I believe we understate the costs of war; when we make the decision to fight, we make the decision to kill, and that means lives and families destroyed.  Mine now falls into that category; the next time the question of war or peace comes up, if you knew me at least you can understand a bit more just what it is you're deciding to do, and whether or not those costs are worth it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This is true love. You think this happens every day?"--Westley, The Princess Bride</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Good night, my love, the brightest star in my sky."--John Sheridan, Babylon 5</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the hardest part. While I certainly have no desire to die, at this point I no longer have any worries. That is not true of the woman who made my life something to enjoy rather than something merely to survive. She put up with all of my faults, and they are myriad, she endured separations again and again ..... I cannot imagine being more fortunate in love than I have been with Amanda. Now she has to go on without me, and while a cynic might observe she's better off, I know that this is  a terrible burden I have placed on her, and I would give almost anything if she would not have to bear it. It seems that is not an option. I cannot imagine anything more painful than that, and if there is an afterlife, this is a pain I'll bear forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wasn't the greatest husband. I could have done so much more, a realization that, as it so often does, comes too late to matter. But I cherished every day I was married to Amanda. When everything else in my life seemed dark, she was always there to light the darkness. It is difficult to imagine my life being worth living without her having been in it. I hope and pray that she goes on without me and enjoys her life as much as she deserves. I can think of no one more deserving of happiness than  her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I will see you again, in the place where no shadows fall."--Ambassador Delenn, Babylon 5</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know if there is an afterlife; I tend to doubt it, to be perfectly honest. But if there is any way possible, Amanda, then I will live up to Delenn's words, somehow, some way. I love you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our thoughts and prayers are with Amanda, Andrew's parents, and all of his family. May they soon find comfort and respite from their grief. May we always remember Andrew for his life, service, and sacrifice. And may countless others have the blessing of reading his words.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Sergeant Whiting was born in Belton, TX, but at a young age moved to Hancock, NY, where he developed a love for the great outdoors. Justin was an avid hunter who reveled in the rugged landscape near the Delaware River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knew him describe Sergeant Whiting as an adventurer. It was this virtue, coupled with his deep-seated love for his country, which led him to join the Army just 2 months after his high school graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Army, he chose the most difficult path he could pursue, that of becoming a Green Beret. The Special  Forces soldiers I know are the pride of our country. All at once, they are soldiers, intelligence officers, diplomats, tacticians, linguists, trainers, and advisors. They are at the tip of the spear of our national defense. The Green Beret that they wear, said President Kennedy, is "a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction  in the fight for freedom."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Whiting was on his third tour in Iraq, on a mission to help bring security and stability to a region torn by violence and tragedy. Every day, he and his unit put themselves in harm's way to give Iraqi citizens a chance at a society governed by the rule of law, free from the threats of sectarian strife, terrorism, or autocratic rule. He served bravely and was highly decorated. Among many other honors, he earned the Bronze Star, one of the highest awards given for combat service, for his  bravery and selflessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who did not know Justin personally, it is difficult to know what inspired his extraordinary sense of duty or what fueled his courage on the battlefield. Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father and an Army officer, explained that "There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty that makes human nature rise above itself in acts of bravery and heroism." I imagine that Justin found his strength in many sources--friends, family, and fellow soldiers--but I imagine that he, too, was motivated  by an enthusiasm for liberty and a passion for justice. In his life, he consistently chose the path that was most challenging so that he could offer our country his highest service. He was a true patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Justin's mother, Estelline, to his father, Randall, to his sister, Amanda, and to his brother, Nathan, our thoughts and prayers are with you. I hope that in time, your grief will be assuaged by the pride you must feel in Justin's service and by the honor he bestowed upon his country. May we never forget his service and his sacrifice.</paragraph>
