    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time last year, the Jack Abramoff scandal was on the front pages of the newspaper. Today, a new guilty plea in the scandal proves it is not over. It is like deja vu all over again. The president of a major environmental group with close ties to this administration pleaded guilty to obstructing a congressional investigation and agreed to provide assistance in the ongoing Jack Abramoff scandal investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In little more than 4 months, Democrats and Republicans together in Congress have put an end to "business as usual" on Capitol Hill and passed the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate. But our work is not done. We must continue to hold those in this institution accountable for their conduct, and reform doesn't stop at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The American people deserve better from their public servants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress passed legislation to assure that the public trust is not lost at the expense of private interests. We are shining a bright light on the goings on at the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of the Interior, the Veterans Administration and the Student Loan Administration. With the power to hold hearings and ask questions that demand answers, this Congress is holding the administration and their officials accountable for their conduct and their oversight  of the public trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America voted for change, and we will hold both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue accountable. We will never accept business as usual in Washington and will not stop until we bring the right reforms to the goings on here in Washington.</paragraph>
