    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Jim Shoulders, a favorite son of Oklahoma who called my district home. He passed away on June 20 at the age of 79.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shoulders rode his way to legendary status as a cowboy on the backs of bucking broncos and snorting bulls. Known as the "Babe Ruth of rodeo," Mr. Shoulders dominated the professional rodeo circuit during the 1940s and 1950s, rounding up seven world titles in bull-riding, four world crowns in bareback-riding, five all-round world championships, and three consecutive rodeo triple-crowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As great as he was during his prime, his humility always shown through. He liked to downplay his skills by saying that "all there is to bull-riding is to put one leg on each side of the bull and make an ugly face for 8 seconds."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shoulders burst into the rodeo world in the 1940s, at the age of 14. While working the wheat harvest, he decided to take a break to watch a minor league rodeo nearby. He resolved to try it for himself and won the event as well as $18. Between that $18 start in the minor league rodeo and his elections to the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame, and the Pro-Rodeo Hall of Fame, he won an unprecedented 16 world championships. He is also the only professional cowboy to be honored  in the Madison Square Garden Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the tough old cowboy was not only known for his exploits in the rodeo, he was also loved for his candid sense of humor, humbleness, loyalty, and toughness, everything Oklahomans are proud to be known for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand today to honor and celebrate the life of Jim Shoulders, a great cowboy, a great Oklahoman, and a great man.</paragraph>
