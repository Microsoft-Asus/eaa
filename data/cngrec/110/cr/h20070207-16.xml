    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend, a deadly tornado inflicted enormous damage in my Congressional district. Yet even in the darkest times, the victims of the storm were enveloped in the incredible generosity of its neighbors. By Saturday, over 1,400 volunteers provided 22,000 meals and snacks and distributed 1,000 health kits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim Miller and his three sons helped the Suggs family gather their belongings after the storm left. Tim Miller said, "I'm just doing what I can to help."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Villages resident Al Seiden said, "Despite our house being destroyed ..... if you look around, there are at least eight people, volunteers, friends and neighbors who have come in and helped us ..... The spirit of this community is unbelievable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wendy Spencer, the COE of the Governor's Commission on Volunteerism adds, "We are receiving so many offers to help, which is wonderful. Our goal is to maximize this generosity to be as effective as it can be for meeting the needs of the tornado survivors now and in the weeks and months to come."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to all these volunteers. Great job.</paragraph>
