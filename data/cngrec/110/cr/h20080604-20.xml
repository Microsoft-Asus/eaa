    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as oil prices continue to climb, increasing American energy production is critical to meeting this challenge. Yesterday, the Department of Energy announced a $715,000 grant to my alma mater, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, to develop more effective ways to drill for oil. Students and professors will work together, along with industry, to achieve higher energy yields from each drilling hole. Better exploration and drilling procedures and techniques are just  two parts of a comprehensive energy strategy that we need to have because a magic bullet will not solve our energy challenges. It will not lower the price at the pump alone. We need a comprehensive strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People of southwest Louisiana and around the country want to increase responsible energy production, they want to see increased refining capacity, they want to unleash American entrepreneurship and ingenuity to solve our energy problems, and they don't want any further delays because gas at the pump, as you can see, is just short of $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to stop the delay and have a comprehensive energy solution. I challenge the Democratic leadership to work with us and stop the delay. Let's get a solution to our energy problems.</paragraph>
