    <paragraph>In Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, a town in my congressional district, Allegheny Police Detective Lawrence Carpico saved the life of 16-year-old Sarah Deiuliis, a victim of a school acquaintance, on October 31, 2007. Sarah had been lured into the woods by someone she considered a friend. When the young man attacked her with a hammer, she fended off her attacker and ran luckily into the path of Detective Carpico who happened upon the couple while walking a dog. Detective  Carpico, who was off duty at the time, acted decisively and ushered the girl to safety and called for the assistance of on-duty officers and medics. For his actions, he will be presented with the Mount Lebanon Police Department's Chief's Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, let's recognize Sarah, who displayed extraordinary courage in the face of extreme danger. She fought back against her attacker using intelligence and quick thinking. For this, she will be recognized with the Survivor Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great honor to represent such courageous citizens and to present  their story in this Chamber, and I commend both for their actions.</paragraph>
