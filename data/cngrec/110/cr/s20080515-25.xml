  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LEO KELLY -- (Senate - May 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4278">S4278</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is always sad when a World War II veteran leaves us. These men and women served our country with immense courage, skill, and dedication, and came home from war to make immense contributions to our society. They have rightly been called "the greatest generation," and we mourn the loss of each and every one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 18, another member of the "greatest generation" died. Navy veteran Leo Kelly was 87 and lived in Burlington Township in New Jersey with his wife of 58 years, Claire. Leo was the father of six daughters and a son, and I came to know him because his daughter Beth is married to my nephew Joe Kennedy, a son of Robert Kennedy and a former Congressman from Massachusetts in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is Leo Kelly's extraordinary career in the Navy that I want to call to the attention of my colleagues in Congress. Leo Kelly answered the Nation's call soon after World War II began. He enlisted in the Navy in 1942 at the age of 21 and retired in 1964 with the rank of lieutenant commander.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He became a Navy fighter pilot and earned numerous awards and medals for valor and bravery under fire during the war. He served on the USS Langley, which was named for the great American scientist and aviation pioneer Samuel Pierpont Langley. The ship was on the front lines during the critical final years of the war in the Pacific, and the crew as a whole was cited in glowing terms by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal for their outstanding heroism in action that contributed so much  to our Nation's victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo Kelly himself was awarded both the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his special heroism on January 12, 1945 in an attack on Japanese shipping in Camranh Bay in French Indo-China, which is now Vietnam. As the citation by President Roosevelt stated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kelly fearlessly dove his plane through a heavy curtain of powerful anti-aircraft fire to score two direct hits with his rockets and contribute to the damaging of an enemy merchant vessel. Then, joining in an attack against a group of hostile seaplanes on the water, he executed a series of strafing runs and, striking furiously at his target, personally destroyed one of the enemy aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Courage like that is what made Leo Kelly a true American hero, and the Nation owes him a debt we can never fully repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Leo Kelly continued his career in the Navy for nearly two decades. From 1953 to 1955 he was assigned to a Naval ROTC unit in Philadelphia and earned his bachelor's degree in political science and attended the Navy's postgraduate school. He retired from the Navy in 1964 and went to work for Tenneco Plastics Company in Burlington, where he and Claire raised their wonderful family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had many interests. He was an excellent golfer, and had played for various Navy teams early in his career. He loved classical music, especially playing the violin. He had a profound faith in God, was a member of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church in Burlington, and had been a member of the Bridge Prison Ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also a wonderful family man, as so many members of his family said so movingly at the service held for him in February. His daughter Beth said it beautifully in her eulogy at the service:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our father was a strong, quiet force in our lives, guiding us, always encouraging, smiling or nodding his approval....... He always adjusted to whatever came his way. The very qualities that made him excel at being a pilot prepared him for a life with six daughters and one son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is grateful to Leo Kelly for all he did for our country during his extraordinary life, and I know that future generations of his family will always treasure his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have his daughter Beth's eulogy printed in the Record, along with the full texts of the World War II citations he received.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Eulogy by Beth Kennedy for Her Father,</narrative>
  <narrative>World War II Naval Hero Leo Kelly</narrative>
  <narrative>[Military Chapel, Wrightstown, New Jersey, Feb. 25, 2008]</narrative>
  <narrative>Good afternoon. I'm Beth Kennedy, one of Leo and Claire's many daughters who no one can keep straight. It's as though our names are interchangeable!</narrative>
  <narrative>On behalf of my mother and my brother and sisters, I'd like to thank all of you for coming to celebrate our father's life and mourn his passing.</narrative>
  <narrative>I just wanted to share a few words before we all leave today. My mother always told me, for as long as I can remember, God will never give you more than you can bear. He will give you the strength to accept His will.</narrative>
  <narrative>And for my family, those words were never more true than during the past week as we began a life without our father. We each have our special memories of Dad. Some we remember with lots of laughter, and some we reflect on privately. But all of them are filled with love, and all of them are joined with our mother, who was always by his side, beautiful and smiling. You know, in all the hundreds of photos we sorted through for this occasion, in every single picture our mother was smiling radiantly,  as though every moment with her husband--and later, with her children--was a gift. And it was a gift for us, too.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mom, you were Dad's co-pilot. The love of his life. You taught us what love and devotion truly are.</narrative>
  <narrative>Kathy, you spent so much time helping take care of Dad, always with humor and grace. You were a leader for all of us.</narrative>
  <narrative>Michelle, you spoke so beautifully last night about Dad. You took care of so many details of his health care, always with patience and love.</narrative>
  <narrative>Nancy, you embraced our parents' spirituality the most, and shared a strong religious bond with Dad.</narrative>
  <narrative>Leo, you inherited Dad's quiet strength, and to this day you share your time and energy helping your family and your friends in need, most times without even being asked.</narrative>
  <narrative>Teresa, you would always brighten Dad's days with your sparkling optimism and good cheer, along with a little something for his sweet tooth and a visit from Michael.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jackie, you could always make Dad smile, and you could always get away with anything. Dad was so happy and proud to finally become a grandfather.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our parents gave us so many wonderful memories: trips to the seashore; our family outing to the Poconos; grilling steaks in the backyard at Salem Road; Friday night fish fry dinners at Howard Johnson's. And later in our lives, as our father gave each of us girls away on our wedding days, dancing with the happy bride. And always, always, praying with us for God's blessing. Our parents gave us the highest standard for a strong marriage filled with love and faith.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our father was a strong, quiet force in our lives, guiding us, always encouraging--smiling or nodding his approval. I remember the day I moved to Boston after graduating high school. After my teary goodbye to mom, my father drove me to the train station in Trenton. He got me settled in on the train, bags secured, and I took so long saying goodbye to him with tears and prayers--the train took off with both of us on it!! He had to get off at the next stop and wait for a train to take him back to  Trenton. I was delighted to have his company for such a nice send-off, but I do recall an inordinate amount of throat-clearing by Dad.</narrative>
  <narrative>He always adjusted to whatever came his way. The very qualities that made him excel at being a pilot prepared him for a life with six daughters and one son. I read through Dad's pilot rating book a few nights ago, and I was struck by the consistent comments and descriptions of him: "smooth, dependable, eager to learn, retains instruction, good coordination in unfavorable weather conditions, good pilot material."</narrative>
  <narrative>Well, Dad, we're all here to say a prayer for you as you join Grandpere and Mamie, Aunt Teen, and all your friends up in Heaven. And as you always said to me at the end of every conversation or phone call--"God bless you good." Goodbye, Dad; I love you; God bless you good.</narrative>
