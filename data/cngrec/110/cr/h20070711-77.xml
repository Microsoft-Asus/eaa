  <narrative>30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7644]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to address the House. And I hope the Members of the House had a great 4th of July break as we celebrate another birthday of this great country. And the great thing about it is you're allowed to say what you want to say  and feel what you want to feel and express yourself in any way that you would like to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as you know, the 30-Something Working Group, we come to the floor to share with not only the Members of Congress, but also with the American people, the importance of good policymaking, and also making sure that we're factual in what we say and what we do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was quite interesting. I was sitting here reading my notes from the information that we pulled together to come to the floor. We're going to talk about Iraq tonight, but I'm going to talk a little bit about SCHIP because we spent a lot of time and many hours on this floor fixing what the Republican Congress left for dead, really. We had to come in, the Democratic majority, with the leadership of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, and save the SCHIP program in many States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of Republican Governors wrote that were in a crisis mode of their program being shut down in the State of Florida, health care for children. In Washington, many people talk about SCHIP. I'm so glad to have the chairman here of the subcommittee that deals with this particular issue. And it goes to show you, here on the Democratic side we have great responsibility when it comes down to fixing and cleaning up the mess that was left from the 109th Congress and the Republican-controlled Congress  and special interests got what they wanted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's also important to note that a supermajority of Republicans voted against the continuing resolution to be able to save the SCHIP program in many States to provide health care for children. And now we're going through the policy move that we have to take to be able to make sure that SCHIP is here for every child and to make sure that they have the kind of health care that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm so glad Mr. Pallone from the Garden State is here because he is the chairman that's dealing with this very issue. I'm a member of the Ways and Means Committee that is also going to be having a discussion on this issue. And I can tell you, as we start to move forth and uncovering and unearthing some of the injustices that have taken place in the past, and we have Governors on our side, we have children advocates on our side, we have those that believe in true health care on our  side in saying that this is not a last-day-at-school kind of syndrome that we see the President and others going through. And I think something is about to happen that is really great and is going to secure and make sure the children have the kind of health care they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Pallone, I would be more than happy to yield to you at this time because I know without notes that you can talk about this because you and your staff have been working on this issue and members of your committee have been working on this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague from Florida, first of all, for being here tonight and for being here for so many nights for so many years now. I know they call them the "30-Something," but it's several years now that you've been doing this on a regular basis, and drawing attention to what the Democrats are doing, and of course when we were in the minority, pointing out the contrasts between ourselves and the Republican majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to give a course in history here tonight, but I have to take issue with what my colleagues from Tennessee and Georgia just said with regard to the children's health initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I think it's really important, and I know you say this all the time, that we're not here as ideologues. I'm not here because I'm a liberal or a conservative or because I want a government-run program or a privately run program. As far as I'm concerned, if everybody could get health care under some kind of privately run insurance program and it was all affordable and we could cover everybody, that would be fine with me. The only reason that the SCHIP or the children's health program  was set up about 10 years ago, and I was there and I was part of it at the time, and it was done on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats supported it, was because we realized that there were more and more children in this country that were going without health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we did not set up an entitlement. I heard my colleagues from Tennessee and Georgia on the Republican side repeatedly refer to this as an entitlement program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not an entitlement program. It is a program that simply gives money in a block grant. I mean, nothing could be less of an entitlement than a block grant, to States like Georgia and Tennessee that they match to try to cover children that don't have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me stress this is for parents who work who have children. We have a Medicaid program for people who are very low income. But what we found 10 years ago, and again, on a bipartisan basis, just as many Republicans as Democrats, what we found 10 years ago was there are a lot of people who work for a living, but they don't get health insurance on the job and they cannot afford to go out in the individual market privately and buy it. I mean, that could cost you $12,000-$15,000 a year if you  have to go out for a family of four and buy health insurance. If you're making 20, 30, $40,000 a year, you can't afford to pay $12,000-$15,000 a year for health insurance for yourself and your children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Federal Government decided, let's give some money to the States. They will match it, and they can help cover these children of working parents whose income is a little too high so they don't qualify for Medicaid, but they can't get health care on the job because their employer doesn't offer it, and they can't afford to go out and buy it on the individual market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what is wrong with that? There is nothing wrong with that. I cannot understand how anyone on the other side of the aisle, including my two Republican colleagues that just spoke, would come out and say that we don't want kids to have health insurance. I mean, what are they talking about? There is no alternative for these people other than to go to the emergency room or the hospital. They can't get it on their job. They can't afford to buy it privately on the individual market. They have no  alternative. And that is simply all we offer to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now my colleagues on the Republican side are talking about entitlements, raising socialism. I mean, this is not an ideological issue. This is just a practical way of trying to deal with a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me tell you something. You already made reference, my colleague, to the fact that some States this year ran out of money to pay for this children's health initiative very earlier, and the State that came here crying first was the State of Georgia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if you would yield for a second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I was sitting here. And the great thing about being a Member of Congress, and I thank the people from the 17th Congressional District in Florida for sending me here, it's almost like, coach, get me the ball. I wanted to say, will the gentleman yield? Because it's interesting that Georgia was on their knees with hands clasped saying, please help us. Children are about to run out of health care insurance, and we're about to have a crisis. And it was the leadership of this Congress, the  Democratic Congress, that brought about that kind of change. That's why people wake up at 7 a.m. in the morning to go vote for representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now we're down to politics, Mr. Speaker. And it's very unfortunate, politics is playing a role in the lives of our children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews that need health care. And this is for working folks. These are for folks who punch in and punch out every day, individuals that are struggling every day that are hoping that the government will stand for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chairman, continue. I yield back. But I'm just saying if Florida was in the situation, I couldn't come down here to the floor and start knocking something that this Congress ran to the savior. And what we had to do, Mr. Chairman, was to couple it with a number of other things to get it to pass for the President not to veto it. And we're going to talk about that a little later, but I think that's very, very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back, sir.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I just want to follow up on what you said. You know, this money that we give to States to help cover these kids in the last few years has run out very early for a lot of States. And, again, it was the gentleman from Georgia's own State, it  was State representatives, Secretary of Health and Human Services, whatever they call that person in the State, came down here in February. And they were over in the Speaker's office, and I was asked  to come. And there were Republicans and Democratic Congressmen in that room. Now, I can't say for sure that the gentleman who spoke tonight was there, but there were other Republicans. He may have been, but I don't want to say for sure because I don't remember. But there definitely were Republican Congressmen from the State of Georgia in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>supplemental bill. Some people know that as the Iraq supplemental, but it really covered a lot of different things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as you say, we put $750 million just to cover Georgia and other States to the end of this year. And you know how difficult it was. The President threatened to veto it three or four times. We finally got it passed. And every month I would get calls or letters from the Georgia delegation saying, when are you going to pass this money because we're going to have to tell these kids that they don't have any health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I don't understand how they come down here on the Republican side and complain about this program that they helped start, that their State is asking for money. Most of the people in that room from the State of Georgia were Republican, not Democrats, okay. And we're just practically saying, okay, look, we don't want to have to run out of this money every year because obviously this program is growing because the number of uninsured kids, again, from working families, keeps getting bigger every  year. It's up to something like nine million children nationally that don't have any health insurance. Okay. And what we're saying is, let's come up with a larger pot of money over the next 5 years to pay for these kids so that, there is about six million of those nine million that are eligible for the children's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all we're saying is, let's take some money, in this case over 5 years it would cost about maybe $50 billion to cover these kids that are already eligible for this SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, how in the world the Democratic initiative to simply pay for kids that are already eligible for this program that's already on the books becomes socialism or entitlements or some kind of radical procedure here. For the life of me, I simply do not understand. I mean, there is nothing here that's new. There is nothing new here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, you said $5 billion over the next 5 years?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>We're talking about $50 billion over the next 5 years, about $10 billion more per year, to cover the rest of the kids that are currently eligible for this program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's $50 billion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Right. And we're not talking about anything new here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Right, additional money.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, let me tell you, per year in Iraq we spend $120 billion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Exactly. And where do these kids go? They have no place to go. The only place they go is if they get sick or they need attention, they have to go to the hospital emergency room. And what kind of a way is that to operate a health care system where you have to take your kid to the hospital emergency room because they can't see a doctor on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, one of them said community health centers. I'm all for community health centers. I think it would be wonderful if every town in the country had a community health center and you could go there and get free care, but that's not the reality. In my district, we have maybe three or four of these community health centers. I represent about 650,000 people, and we have maybe three or four of these federally sponsored community health centers. There is no way in the world that these parents that  take their kids, all who are uninsured, to these community health centers. There is absolutely no way that that's going to happen.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Imagine the line. Imagine a rural county. Imagine an urban county that I represent, everyone kind of diving into one or two locations to make it all happen. Why should we inconvenience those that are counting on their government to respond, especially on behalf of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm glad you came down here tonight to have you here, the person that has the gavel in their hand, heard testimony from the States. I know you know what I'm saying. This is what you're doing and this is why we're here. And Americans voted for a new direction, and we're heading in that new direction. There are those that are Members of Congress that don't want to move in that new direction. And, Mr. Speaker, like I said, the great thing about our country is that we can disagree and you can voice  your opinion and other ideas, but I think it's important also for the American people to get fact and not fiction. And that's what we're here about, and that's what it's all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You are always welcome, Mr. Chairman, to come down. I am a part of the "something" part of the 30-something. So you can join, and that caucus is growing. And the good thing about what we do here on the floor from those new Members of Congress, we call them "majority makers," to those that have been here as long as you have been here, to see this process go full circle, 360 degrees, to be able to come to the floor at 11-something at night, to be able to set the record straight I think is important  not only for Members of Congress, but also for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record and for those individuals that are listening to the statements that are being made here on the floor that know better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate it, and I know you want to get back to the Iraq war, as I think you should. I want to thank you again, and just say in conclusion from my part of this tonight, what I really don't like is trying to make this into an ideological debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I hear my colleagues on the Republican side, instead of being practical and looking at what is going to accomplish something, to start making it ideological and talk about entitlements and socialism and the whole thing, we don't need that. We don't need that rhetoric here. We as Democrats are trying to accomplish things in a practical way, without ideology, without right or left and all this jargon that we are hearing from the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just hope that it doesn't continue, because otherwise I am going to come down here every night and talk about why practically speaking the children's health initiative is a good program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield, just to make one last point on this, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for coming down, before I came here, I was the chairman of the Public Health Committee in the Connecticut State Legislature. What we figured out over time, because we were a State that submitted waivers to the Federal Government to expand our children's healthcare program, so we actually ended up with one of the more generous SCHIP programs in the country. We  had more kids as a percentage of children who were eligible for children's healthcare, sponsored and subsidized by the State and Federal Government, than most other States, and what we found was that was actually reducing the cost of healthcare over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I got to listen to a little bit of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle earlier, and they act as if we have existing today a fiscally responsible system of healthcare. We don't. We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may have covered this earlier before I got on to the floor. But we  have the most expensive healthcare system in the world for outcomes that are lucky if they rival those of countries that spend 50 percent less on their healthcare, 16 percent of GDP in this country compared to 10 or 11 percent in other countries that insure everybody and get basically the same or better outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we found in Connecticut was as we expanded the reach of our SCHIP program and got more kids eligible and enrolled, we were actually cutting the cost of care for those kids because, guess what? Preventative care, as I am sure has been said on the Floor, is much less expensive, much more fiscally responsible than crisis care, when these kids show up in the emergency room with much more complicating, debilitating illnesses that require much more expensive care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, for my money, investing in children's healthcare insurance is the right thing for taxpayer dollars. We certainly know it is the humane thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, to insure children who have no healthcare through no fault of their own. But it is certainly the right thing to do if we are going to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I were sent here, as the folks on the other side of the aisle believe they have been, to be stewards of taxpayer dollars, I would be investing in preventative healthcare every single day I was here, and that is what the SCHIP program does.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Murphy, I just want to thank you, definitely fresh out of the State legislature, for coming to this floor. I served in the legislature myself, and I can tell you that in Florida we enjoy the Federal assistance that is there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some folks, Mr. Speaker, speak of Medicare as socialized medicine. If you try to do away with Medicare right now and have new and great ideas that would limit access to clinics and what have you, I think you would have an uprising in this country as we look at providing better healthcare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I can, we came to the floor tonight, and I have my Iraq notebook with me, and I want to thank not only staff but the Democratic leadership for taking a forward lean, as we have done since we have been here in the control of the House, and the American people provided us with an opportunity to lead, to move this country in a new direction, and also move this issue of Iraq in a new direction. I just want to talk a little bit about the numbers, and I want this to sink in, because I want Members  to know exactly what we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to create and we have to be about a major paradigm shift, I would say slash "new direction," as it relates to Iraq. We know that the President has executive authority and he can veto. We know that the legislature, and when we say legislature, I started talking about States, I started talking about legislature, I would say the Congress, the legislative branch of government has the responsibility of policy and making sure that we pass legislation that will be helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 4th of July break, which was a wonderful thing, you have an opportunity to go back to your districts and you have an opportunity to go to places where you can learn more, I actually went to Norfolk, Virginia, to the Naval facility there and spoke to a number of sailors and some marines and others that have been deployed before. I was there on a destroyer and also a submarine and also an amphibious vessel that moved marines into a forward area and had an opportunity to talk to a number  of individuals over that weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I left with the impression, Mr. Murphy, of them saying, if you want to help the troops, then stand up for us in the Congress and making sure we bring some sense to what we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some of the bloodiest weekends in Iraq took place during the 4th of July break, and a number of Iraqis have lost their lives and they have a number of civil war conflicts that are going on there. Also a number of marines, soldiers and others, even civilians, lost their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important as we look at this and we go through a forward lean, I just want to capture this moment from the Congressional Research Service, Mr. Speaker, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which is a nonpartisan organization within the Congress. These are individuals that are Ph.D.'s and those that count the numbers and really give the Americans an objective view of what the real picture is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about cost here for a minute. You heard Mr. Pallone, the Chair of a subcommittee dealing with the children's health program, say over 5 years it would take $50 billion to be able to provide healthcare for children. Let's look at these numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Per year in Iraq, and this is the chart that I have here, $120 billion a year. I am going to even further break that down to $10 billion a month and change. These are not my numbers. This is the Congressional Research Service numbers. Per week, $2.3 billion a week in Iraq. $2.3 billion. This is just Iraq. We are not talking about Afghanistan. Per day, $329 million and change. I am not even giving you the change. Per hour, $13 million. That is every hour in Iraq, $13 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about what we can do here domestically. I am talking to the mayors of our cities and our towns. I am talking to commissioners that would like to resolve some issues and want some sort of Federal assistance in doing that. I am talking to the citizen that is wondering why something is shut down in their community for a lack of funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Per minute, $228,000. That is per minute. $228,000. That is more than many Americans make in 5 years, Mr. Murphy, a minute. That is what is happening in Iraq right now. Per second, $3,816. Some may say $4,000 a second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You look at the Forbes' richest, most wealthy Americans, they are not even doing that. You have companies that wish they could make $3,816 a second. This makes Oprah, her income, look very small. This makes some of the new people that are there, the President or the used-to-be chairman of Microsoft, look very small when you look at these numbers. But you have to look at this issue for what it is. These are the dollars that we are spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, who is standing in front of us and making new policy changes here? I think it is important, and I think we are going to have a gut check here, and I want to make sure that Americans know exactly and the Members know. Because many Members, they go back home and they say, I did not quite understand that. I am sorry. It went over my head. I didn't understand what happened, when a constituent may walk up to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week in the House we will have an opportunity to reaffirm our support and move this Iraq debate in a new direction. Responsible redeployment of our troops. We talk about responsible redeployment. We are talking about a bill that Chairman Ike Skelton is going to bring to this floor tomorrow, or sometime this week, where Democrats and Republicans will have an opportunity on the record to vote once again as it relates to redeployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Responsible Redeployment Act, <bill type="h" number="2956">H.R. 2956</bill>. It requires the responsible redeployment of U.S. troops beginning within 120 days of enacting and ending by April 1st, 2008. I think it is important that everyone understands that a supermajority, 70 percent, a supermajority of Americans believe that we should be out of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It requires the President to publicly justify the post-deployment missions for the U.S. military in Iraq with a minimum number of troops necessary to carry out those missions. This is not saying that we are going to take all of the troops out of Iraq, but what it is saying is those troops that are in harm's way, doing the door-to-door, doing all of these things in the middle of a civil war that Iraqi troops should be responsible for, there are a number of people that are saying, you know, they  are not quite ready.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, meanwhile, back at the ranch, I know every Sunday on CNN they have a report talking about what happened in Iraq that week. I think I have seen too many flag-draped coffins. I think I have talked to too many spouses and family members that are saying, what are you going to do and how are you going to do it and how are you going to stand up?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Ike Skelton is beyond this. He is what one may say is an individual that solely has the troops in his heart and in his mind. And this will be a product of not only him, but many Members of Congress. So Members will get an opportunity to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Murphy, before I yield to you, I think it is important that we show who is standing in the schoolhouse door here. I would ask for not only the Members, but also the American people to go to the White House website if you want some information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the Republican minority, thanks to the American people, on March 29 of 2007, stood with the President after we moved the bill through this Congress that would move the policy as it relates to Iraq in a new direction. It would bring more accountability as it  relates to profiteering, more accountability as it relates to how our troops are being deployed based on what the President says that he thinks is right. It is bringing democracy to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we passed that bill, it passed both the House and Senate, I can say that the Democratic majority voted in the affirmative with a few Republicans, and it went to the White House. And before that bill could be carried to the White House, the President said that he would veto it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want you to take a look at this picture here, because I think it is very very important. Pictures speak 1,000 words. You have all Republicans, the minority, that are standing behind the President saying stand with the President and we will not allow the President to be overridden, for there to be an override of his veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important for us to pay very close attention to it, because my message to those that were on the steps of the White House, who met with the President, who had some sort of discussion with the President, that have said "we are going to make sure that the President's will is not overridden," well, I want to ask, how many times will the Republican minority go down and stand with the President in front of the will of the American people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is going to happen this week, Mr. Speaker, and I am glad that Speaker  Nancy Pelosi has said we are willing to take the fight on behalf of the American people to the executive branch and to those Members of Congress who believe that we should be "staying the course" or continuing to do the same thing expecting different results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of things that are going on in Iraq that are not in the control of the American Congress and executive branch and those that they elected to represent them here in Washington, DC. But what we do have control over as it relates to the policy and as it relates to the will of the American people and the troops. One person said if you want to help the troops, get us out of Iraq. If you want to help the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan and I in the 108th and 109th Congress heard all kinds of speeches here on this floor, Mr. Murphy, Members saying "I support the troops." "No, I support the troops more than you." "No, let me take my shirt. Let me show you a tattoo I have on my shoulder saying I support the troops."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not what it is about. It is about policy. It is about manning up and womaning up and leadering up and standing up on behalf of these men and women that are in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>These are real families. We have to treat this issue as it relates to redeployment of troops in Iraq as though our children or our nephew or our cousin or our husband or wife, what have you, are in harm's way as we speak. Those that have a dot.mil address behind their e-mail address that are e-mailing us and are asking us to be leaders, I am glad that this House is moving in the direction, and the Senate is moving in the direction, and I commend those Senators that have come to the side of the  American people saying enough is enough. The President can burn all kind of Federal jet fuel and fly throughout the country. He was in Cleveland talking about what we need to do. Enough is enough. The bottom line is that folks have to come to grips that this is a democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House is under some sort of impression, I want to say impression. They believe if they were to come out at a press conference, if the President were to say the rain doesn't fall from the sky, it comes up from the ground to the sky, they believe many Americans would actually look outside to see if that is true. We know what is right and what is wrong. What is wrong is the fact that we can no longer stand idly by and let this happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic Congress has tried to make this happen. We need Republican support. We need the American people to call their Republican representative and say enough with this partisan stuff, let's move for our young men and women in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to Mr. Ryan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that this is not just us, or the Democrats or the American people. Mr. Meek, Mr. Murphy, these are the soldiers who are coming back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know what your personal experiences have been, but the soldiers in my district who have come back, and I meet them for a cup of coffee at the coffee shop and they talk off the record, they say, Get us out because this is insane. It is ridiculous. The only thing we all hear from the soldiers who say I want to go back, they say they want to go back because their buddies are over there. They are not going back because there is some great cause that the President has outlined for them. They  are so far beyond that. They go back because their buddies are there, and God bless them. Those are the kind of buddies that we all want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important that that picture that you showed, Mr. Meek, and what the minority party is trying to do here by not giving us enough votes to override a Presidential veto in the House and in the Senate is they are complicit in following President George W. Bush's foreign policy that has taken this country right off the cliff. Mr. Meek, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Speaker, $600 billion, thousands of lives lost, innocent people in Iraq getting bombed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And here's the bottom line that I think the country needs to know and completely understand. This President has made the country less safe. There are more terrorists today that are gunning at the United States than ever before. Even pre-9/11, and now al Qaeda is coming out and saying we are stronger than we have ever been. We are as strong as we were on 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have thousands and thousands of more terrorists who want a gun to come at the United States. There are sleeper cells I am sure in the United States, but when we try to pass a Homeland Security bill that funds 3,000 more Border Patrol agents, that puts the proper equipment and the proper technology on the borders to make sure that when the cargo is coming into the ports that those are checked, that our first responders have the proper equipment that they need, the Republican minority basically  filibustered in the House and tried to stop that from happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are saying here is that if we don't quickly rectify this problem and start making investments that we can go after Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda instead of this mess that we are in in Iraq, then we are more vulnerable as a country. And if something happens in this country, it lays right at the footsteps of the White House because we have been fighting this war. It has been ridiculous. The whole concept has been ridiculous. George Herbert Walker Bush said it was crazy to go into Iraq.  This has not made any sense since the beginning. And now we are wasting $600 billion fighting a war in some country that we don't know a whole lot about instead of focusing that money on making sure that we get Osama bin Laden, making sure that we destroy al Qaeda. That's the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so if al Qaeda hits the United States of America, it is because George Bush led us into a war in a country that didn't have any al Qaeda members in it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan, the bottom line is that the President, and we have to talk about the student loan issue that he talked about earlier today, and I think it is important that we talk about that because again we had Members here talking about SCHIP and we were all once representatives in our States on the legislative end on the State level. But I think it is important for us to, and where is my red chart to talk about the debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just had Mr. Pallone as the chairman of the subcommittee down here, and we have a proposal talking about $50 billion over the next 5 years. Let me say real quick, per year it is $120 billion in Iraq and climbing. I say that to a mayor or to a Governor, I  would like to have my hands on $120 billion that the Federal commitment has made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan, it is not the President, that is all too easy. The President is in his last leg of a swim meet here. He has the last day of school kind of syndrome. All of us know what the last day or last week of school felt like. I am about to leave the institution, and I don't have to worry about what is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But guess what, it is not the last day of school for the American people and those that are in harm's way. We have a responsibility to stand for them. I am not going to just leave the President. I am going to say that those individuals on the Republican side of the aisle, not all of them, but a majority of them, are willing to stand with the President that ran this record debt up that we have now. A $1.19 trillion debt and climbing, done by the Republican majority in the 108th and 109th Congress  and beyond, of rubber stamping what the President has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all live the same kind of lives. We all understand our responsibility up here. But I tell you, to be able to move in a new direction in Iraq, it is going to take more than just Democratic majority Members, especially in the Senate, to be able to bring some real sense to this new direction in Iraq. The real issue is that there is a choice to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan, some of the Members on the Republican side used to laugh at us when we were on the floor. I see them in the hall and they are like, "You all are funny. Do you really believe people are going to follow what you all are talking about if you are given the opportunity to lead?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, guess what, how do you like us now? People believe. Democrats, Republicans, Independents. And you know something, some people who voted for the first time in their lives who had given up on the political system, and I will be doggone if their vote goes in vain. I am telling you right now, we need Republican Members of this Congress to vote on behalf of our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Want to help the troops? Vote for redeployment. You want to help the troops, vote for antiprofiteering legislation. You want to help the troops, when Mr. Murtha comes to this floor with an appropriations bill that is going to bring major sense as it relates to the appropriations in this war, then support that if you want to support the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan, I am going to yield to Mr. Murphy by saying this: As of July 11, today, the deaths in Iraq as it relates to U.S. military personnel, and this is not even counting those clandestine agents that are out there, those civilian folks, 3,609. That is as of 10 a.m. this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Total number of wounded in action, returned to duty, 14,681.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number of wounded that did not return to duty, 12,014 and climbing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say this is real. This is above and beyond Democrat-Republican politics, Independent politics, whatever the case may be. We are moving in the direction of redeployment of our troops and a new policy. The President can stand in the schoolhouse door all he wants to, but the bottom line is he is empowered by the Republican minority that are saying that we are not going to allow you to have enough votes to be able to override what the President is saying. That is where it comes down to  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you, like I shared with some of my colleagues, you continue to follow the President on the old way, and I guarantee you, just like I said in the 108th Congress and 109th Congress, and I don't have a whole lot of say in what goes on in some of these districts because people have their own heart and mind. They read and they see. They see the people that are not coming back. People are being deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are not glad they are going. They are crying when people are going. Will I see my husband? Will I see my father again? What are we doing? What does this mean? We are in the middle of a civil war; what does that mean? Will my husband or wife be knocking down some door as we speak here on this floor, having Iraqis huddle in the middle of a room on a security mission that is necessary because the Iraqi government is not doing it, and those individuals will never forget that. And they are not  doing it just because they feel like doing it; they are doing it because it is the mission. We support them in that mission, but the bottom line is we have to have a new attitude and new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are Iraqi troops that should be doing those house checks and taking that responsibility, and an Iraqi parliament that should be coming to work every day to make sure that they do what they do. It shouldn't be our people, and people know it. So the bottom line is, when you are in a place where you don't understand exactly where you should be, fall on the side of commonsense. That is all that I am saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Murphy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know because we have talked to these families. When they are crying about their loved ones injured in the field of battle or, God forbid, have not come back, there is also a sense from military families that their despair is because they realize they are the only ones that are being asked to sacrifice for this war.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>What happened to the coalition, Mr. Murphy?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>The coalition of the willing is no more, Mr. Meek. What is left are the military family, and their friends and families have been asked to shoulder almost the entire burden of this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we talk about where we are going to spend the taxpayer dollars, you have to talk about what we are getting for that investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You gave the statistics on the casualties since the beginning of the war, but it is even more terrifying when you talk about what has happened simply since the surge has begun: 593 soldiers have died since January 10; 3,500 have been wounded; 1,600 wounded so badly they cannot return to battle. We are talking about 13,000 Iraqi civilians and members of the military police who have been killed or wounded since the surge took place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you have to ask what we are getting for this investment. It has gone from $8 billion a month to $10 billion a month since the surge has gone into effect. What we have gotten is an Iraqi political institution or Iraqi political infrastructure which is even less willing to take responsibility for its own actions, even less able to take control of their own country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was reported in the Associated Press of the President's report on progress in Iraq that the Iraqi government has not "met any of its targets for political, economic and other reform." Has not met any of the targets we have given them for economic, political reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parliament is going home for the summer. There is a parliament where the biggest Sunni group has pulled out. You have an inability for the Iraqis to deal with their own shop. As someone said, right now the Iraqis are paying wholesale for their politics because we are subsidizing every decision that is being made there. It is time they start paying retail for their political decisions, and that is only going to happen when they have a sense of when the crutch is going to be taken away from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan, I think to myself when we talk about how we are going to spend money, whether we are going to spend $120 billion a year in Iraq or whether we are going to spend $40 or $50 billion on children's health care insurance, and I think, as Mr. Ryan said, that $120 billion investment is getting more and more Americans killed every day and is making this country less safe and less safe every day, and is making it less and less likely that the Iraqis  will ever be able to take control of their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's a terrible investment. That's a bad investment. When I think about $50 billion in children's health care, by doing the right thing, the moral thing for kids, and at the same time, probably making our health care system more affordable and less costly in the end, because we're hooking kids up with preventative health care, that's a great investment. That's a worthwhile investment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>We're slingshotting the kids then for 5 months.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>At some point, we've got to talk about what results we're getting for our money, and if you can turn around even a portion of the money that we're using over there to make this country  less safe, turn it around and college age, children's health care, I mean meat and potatoes things that matter to middle-class families, those are the investments that I came to Congress to work on. Those are the investments that millions of  Americans around this country sent a new class of Democrats here to work on, and if we can get some Republicans to stand up with us this week, as we have seen happening in the Senate over the last week and a half, we'll start to make good on those promises.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, $50 million for children's health care or 5 months more in Iraq, let the American people make that decision. Poll that, get the focus group out and figure that one out, where the American people are going to be. They're going to be with the leadership. They're going to be with the Speaker. They're going to be with the majority leader in the Senate. They're going to be for making these investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I just love, Mr. Speaker, how our Republican counterparts went way back to 1992, they went into the deep parts of the Republican library, the CATO Institute and everywhere else, and they pulled out the 1992 talking points, and they've dusted them off and everything's socialism and union bosses. And it's typical of why they're not in power.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>I guess I wonder whether the water is different in the Republican cloakroom down here than it is in the Senate cloakroom, because what we've seen in the last couple of weeks, and I've got a list here of all of the people who have changed their opinion on the war in the last several weeks and all the quotes from Republicans in the United States Capitol regarding their new opinion of this war, which is that we should set a date for withdrawal, and it is Senate Republican  after Senate Republican after Senate Republican after Senate Republican, Dick Lugar, George Voinovich, Pete Domenici, Lamar Alexander, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's missing from that list, for some reason, are members of the Republican minority here in the House. This is the body that's supposed to actually be more responsive to the American people, not less responsive. So I haven't been here long enough to understand what the difference is, but some Republicans are waking up to the notion that it's time for a change. It just hasn't happened here yet.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's the God's honest truth of where we are. The force of the American people broke through in the election, but it is yet to penetrate the ideology of the Republican leadership and the Republicans in the House, many of them, and everything is coming down to priorities. It's all coming down to priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when Mr. Murphy and Mr. Pallone and yourself are talking about making this investment in the children's health care, poor kids getting health care, our friends on the other side are so void of any ideas on how to make America competitive in the 21st century that they have got to scream socialism, and I urge all of our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to go back to the 1930s and 1940s and 1950s and 1960s. The only argument our friends on the extreme right have is socialism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're talking about a bill that passed out of the Appropriations Committee with bipartisan support. The Members who are coming down here are extremists. They are the extreme neoconservatives who have implemented their policy over the last 6 years and have run this country domestically into the ground, have run our foreign policy into the ground, and now all they have is names to call us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, go out, and when these millions of kids have health care, go to them and say, you know what, you really shouldn't get that health care because it's socialism, okay? When you go to college and you have an extra 700 bucks in a Pell grant or over the next few years it will be an increase of over $1,000 by 2011, from $4,050 to over $5,000, go to that college family, the parents that are struggling to pay for that, and let our friends on the other side say we have no business helping you with  college; that's not the role of government, Mr. Speaker, that's socialism. And when we cut student interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, I urge all of our friends on the other side, go to all the millions of families across this country and say we don't want to do that, that's socialism; let the free market work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These banks have been sucking off the government for years. We didn't raise taxes to do this. All we did was say the banks aren't going to make a big profit on the student loans. We're going to give it to the kids and give them a nice 3.4 percent rate so they can go get an education and go get a job and go create wealth and go start a business and hire people that are going to pay taxes to keep tax rates low for everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They're void of ideas, and this is the best investment. I mean, this is great. We get to go, over the course of the next year, and campaign on this? This is good stuff.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>The thing about it and the thing about what we work on and what we meet on, and after we leave the floor I need to talk to you even further about this issue, because, Mr. Speaker, the President was on the road and saying, well, I'm going to veto the interest rate cut that the Democratic Congress passed because it doesn't help enough needy kids that are presently in college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, this is the same President who said we're going to be treated as liberators when we were in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same President that has said that investing in big oil will be able to assist us to be energy independent when big oil made nothing but profits after the White House meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same President that said he was going to treat anyone in the White House that outed an CIA agent in a way that they should be treated, and then later let that person off the hook through his executive power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same President that has said that we need to send an escalation of troops to Iraq and we'll see a safer Iraq; that we've seen otherwise, some 500-plus men and women in uniform that have lost their lives since that surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same President that goes on and on and on talking about how he's going to increase Pell Grants when he hasn't done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same President that said that 9/11, that we are going to implement this Department of Homeland Security and said there was no need to pass all of the 9/11 recommendations. That still hasn't made it to his desk yet, that we want to get passed, that this Democratic Congress passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same President that told folks to go shopping after 9/11 when he had the opportunity to move this country in a new direction, bring us together, help our economy, and the Americans were ready to do what they needed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is the same President saying I'm going to veto a bill that's going to cut student loan rates not only for students, I will go further as a parent to say, for parents and grandparents that are helping children that are now coming out of college that are more in debt now than ever because the Federal Government is not there for them. If we're not there for them, then the State government can't be there for them because they have to cut, and guess where the first place is they go. They  go to students and cut back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm about full right now of the American spirit and say that I hope that our leadership here in the House, with the President, you spoke of politics saying it's a great thing to run on. I always said this whole Iraq issue, if we see more and more pictures like this, Republican leadership leading their caucus down to the White House saying we stand with the President and making sure that the Congress doesn't override his original thoughts or what he feels should be, the White House is not to  be used as the Republican National Committee instrument or the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. This is about the American people and what we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, the President, this is his last day of school. This is the last month of school. He's about to move on. He's about to become a private citizen. Those of us that are in Congress, if the American people that allow us to come back after 2008, will be here to govern this country, and guess what, this is not the last day of school for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, when we talk about cutting student loan rates in half and the President starts using all kinds of, I start to go back to the big oil argument. What,  did the banks have a special meeting at the White House, saying we can't allow this to happen; you got to stand in the schoolhouse door; and will they be able to motivate these Members to go back to the White House and say we stand with the President? How many times?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I know that the bold leadership we have here in the House, if he vetoes this bill, which I don't want him to do, I hope he signs it, and we're able to provide the assistance to these individuals that are in all of our districts, Republican and Democrats. This is not for Democratic kids. This is for all kids, for all families, for all working people. If he does it, I hope that within the hour that he does it that we have something here on this floor, and we'll separate the Members  from the followers here on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when we passed this bill, I know you brought this issue up, but when we passed this bill, there was 143 Republicans that voted against it, just enough to withstand. One, one over to be able to hold off a presidential override. That's a gut check there, Mr. Speaker. I wonder how many of those 143 are going to be with the President in not allowing American families to have a cut in financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want their constituents to pay very close attention on whose side you're on. Are you on the bank's side or are you on the American people side?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Can I make a point because I think this is so important. There's not been a tax increase here. This is not where the President can say, I'm going to veto this bill because the Democrats increased taxes on someone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we did is we shifted this money that was going to the banks and allowed them to charge students 6.8 percent. It was basically corporate welfare, and we're saying that that same amount of money that went to them is going to go to more students for cheaper loans, less interest rates, 3.4 percent instead of 6.8 percent, just a shift in the money, shift in priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what the President's basically saying is I would rather have the banks make the profit than expand student loans to more kids and more parents. Now, that's just reading the facts. Ignore our rhetoric.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>To go deeper than that, let's explain exactly what the deal is. Let's delve one layer deeper into this, explain exactly what the deal is for banks here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We already guarantee all of these loans for the banks. That's a great deal. You tell me that I'm going to lend money to somebody and if they don't pay it back, somebody else is going to pay me back? Well, guess what, I'll probably make that loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then what we did on top of it, on top of it was we gave them a cut of the loan, too. You know what we figured out? They're still going to make the loans even if you don't give them a cut of the loan. They're guaranteed loans. They're essentially guaranteed loans. That's just commonsense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so as Mr. Ryan said, this becomes sort of a socialist welfare program for just a different set of people, people that are doing pretty well already. So, to me, this is just commonsense. So to a lot of people it's commonsense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we go back in our districts, we're hearing a lot of people talking about Iraq. People are behind the Democrats' plan to reorder our priorities there and start going after the real bad guys, but there are a lot of people struggling just with getting by every day and every week, and there are a lot of young parents who are raising young kids and looking at college costs, thinking to themselves how on earth am I going to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to think that one of the things that stands in their way is a system now that subsidizes some pretty well-off banks, at the expense of those parents and their kids, is ludicrous. I mean, frankly, I could probably sit there, even coming from a pretty fiscally conservative State like Connecticut, I could probably sit here and justify bringing in new revenue somehow in order to increase money for student aid. I think I could sell people back in Connecticut, and say, listen, we've got to put  a little more into the pot and we're going take care of students who need help, I mean truly meritorious students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't even have to do that here. We don't even have to make that argument. All we have to do is say listen, we've just got to shift moneys from the haves to the have-nots. That's the brilliance of this program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>I know that we're running out of time, and I think Mr. Ryan is going to move us to a few more minutes here.</paragraph>
