    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, homeland security and the safety of our men and women in uniform should be on the front of everyone's mind in Congress. Yet, we are here again this week discussing a Democrat bill that fails to provide our intelligence community the tools necessary to monitor terrorist activity. The Democrat RESTORE bill does nothing to streamline a process that is hampered by endless red tape and severely slows the reaction time between Washington and our battlefield commanders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intelligence opportunities sometimes exist for minutes, and we need the flexibility to monitor activity that can save lives. The article in the New York Post yesterday is a perfect example. The current law delayed a rescue mission by 10 hours. Our troops should never have to wait 10 hours for permission to rescue them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my Democrat colleagues to reconsider the RESTORE Act. We should focus our efforts on a bipartisan approach to our national security, not on legislating defeat.</paragraph>
