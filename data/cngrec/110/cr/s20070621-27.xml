    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Joseph Simunovich for his leadership, dedication, and accomplishments at Hackensack University Medical Center and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Joe retired as chairman of the board of these great New Jersey institutions earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe's life of public service spans more than three decades. In 1972, he was elected to serve as a Hudson County freeholder, a position he held for 12 years, 3 of them as director/chairman of the board. In 1986, Joe was appointed by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean to serve on the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Reappointed by Governors Jim Florio and Christine Whitman, for a total of six consecutive terms, Joe is the longest serving member in the organization's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, Joe was chosen by Governor James McGreevey to serve as the chairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, where he led the organization through the consolidation with  the New Jersey Highway Authority. Additionally, Joe oversaw the remediation of New Jersey's E-Z Pass system, and the introduction of Express E-Z Pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 17 years of Joe's service on the Board of Governors of Hackensack University Medical Center, no one has had a greater hand in making Hackensack the respected and sought out institution it is today. As chairman of the board, Joe has worked tirelessly to raise money for the expansion of hospital programs. This money means more access to medical treatments, increased technology, and better financial assistance for low-income patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Joe has dutifully served on numerous boards of directors, including New Jersey City University, the New Brunswick Development Corporation, the National Association of Water Companies, and the National Council for Public-Private Partnerships. As a result of his hard work, Joseph Simunovich has helped improve the quality of life for thousands of families living throughout New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dedicated to both his community and family, Joe is married and has two children and several grandchildren. He received his bachelor's degree from Colgate University and masters in business management equivalent from Fairleigh Dickinson University, and completed postgraduate coursework at the Carnegie Institute and guest lectured at Rutgers University School of Business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt Joseph Simunovich is an exemplary leader and a profoundly committed individual who is a true role model for the nation. Therefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Joseph Simunovich, and know my colleagues will join in wishing him continued success.</paragraph>
