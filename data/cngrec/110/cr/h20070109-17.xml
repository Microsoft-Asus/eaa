  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, securing the safety of the American people is our number one priority as elected officials. To do this we must look at all facets of homeland security and take all necessary precautions seriously. Democrats have pledged to address the matter of homeland security comprehensively by implementing the recommendations of the independent, bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Of their 41 recommendations made over 2 years ago, many have been only partially implemented and others have  not been implemented at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of this delay in addressing the Commission's recommendations, we still have major holes in our homeland security system. More than 5 years after 9/11, only 5 percent of containers entering U.S. ports are screened. In addition, most air cargo is not screened at all, and our first responders are still unable to communicate with each other during an emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress can no longer ignore the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. This week we will have an opportunity to better secure our Nation by beginning the process of approving these recommendations.</paragraph>
