    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today the House begins consideration of <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This bill is a collective effort in the bipartisan tradition of the House Armed Services Committee, which approved the bill in markup last week by a vote of 58-0.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank our committee members, particularly our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, for their outstanding work. And special thanks go to the ranking member, Duncan Hunter, and I appreciate his working so hard in a very bipartisan manner to make this bill come to the floor. He's been a partner in this, and I appreciate it. I am proud that we're always able to work together in our efforts to enhance our Nation's defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the polestar of this year's Defense authorization is readiness. Continued reports on the state of readiness for our ground forces, particularly our nondeployed and next-to-deploy forces, are of deep concern. To restore readiness and ensure our forces will be ready if they are called upon for the next fight, this bill fully funds the budget request for the Army and Marine Corps reset of equipment at $13.6 billion and $8.4 billion respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They add some $1 billion in a strategic readiness fund to meet critical readiness requirements identified by a new Defense Readiness Production Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It increases training by $250 million so that our units may get more training time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It requires a plan and a timeline for replenishing prepositioned stocks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it strengthens the National Guard by adding $1 billion for National Guard and Reserve equipment from their unfunded requirements list, ensuring that the National Guard is able to meet its homeland and civil support missions, and also adding a range of authorities through the National Guard Empowerment Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill looks out for our troops in harm's way by dedicating substantial resources to improve protection, including $4.6 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, known as MRAPs, and providing funds for personal body armor and up-armored Humvees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To reduce the strain on our force and in keeping with the House Armed Services Committee's long advocacy of the need to boost end strength, that is, the number of troops, the bill has authorized an increase in the size of the Army by 36,000 Army troops and Marines by 9,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our servicemembers and their families make countless sacrifices and our pride in them knows no bounds. We express our thanks to them through a 3.5 percent pay raise, by blocking TRICARE and pharmacy program fee increases, by expanding special compensation for combat-related disabled retirees, and establishing a special survivor indemnity allowance to begin to address the offset to the survivor benefit plan and the dependents indemnity plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Provisions also include the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, which addresses many of the problems identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; and, Mr. Chairman, you will recall we passed that as a stand-alone bill just a few weeks ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accountability with respect to our own ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is also an important component of the measure. The bill requires General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to report on the implementation of the Joint Campaign Plan for Iraq, as well as on efforts made by the Iraqi Government to achieve political reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Gates is also required to report on the proposed force levels for the 6 months following September, to discuss the missions of our forces, and to inform Congress about contingency planning. The information from this report will help us ask the right questions, the tough questions, and make frank judgments about how we are going to pass the baton on to the Iraqis. I am convinced that the sectarian violence will only be overcome by Iraqi political progress, and thus far, I haven't seen  much of that since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>September's report will be an opportunity for General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to lay out the straight facts. Time is short with the American people, and the Iraqis must act soon. This report will provide real and substantial information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Calling attention to the forgotten war in Afghanistan, the bill provides funds for the Afghanistan security forces and requires a long-term sustainment plan so that the Afghans can build the logistics and other capabilities they need for long-term security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill establishes a new Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction to ensure accountability in contracting there and extends the authority of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also brings more contracting accountability to both Afghanistan and Iraq by forcing the Departments of Defense and State to work together in assigning responsibility for overseeing the thousands of contractors in these places, particularly those who do carry weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Mr. Chairman, the bill requires that the Secretary of Defense undertake an analysis of the Department's roles and missions. In 1947, a similar effort helped shape the Pentagon through the National Security Act. After 60 years, it is time for a new analysis to help eliminate duplication among the services, identify core competencies, and strengthen the Department of Defense and the military while helping us spend money much more wisely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, let me spend just a moment talking about something that is not in this bill. The Military Commissions Act, which was made into law by the last Congress, precludes detainees in Guantanamo from petitioning courts under habeas corpus. This bill does not include a provision to restore the principle of habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo, even though I feel strongly it should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My judgment is that the most promising course of action will be for this House to take up this issue as a separate bill. To that end, I have prepared legislation to address the habeas corpus issue, and I intend to work with the leadership, members of our committee and with the Judiciary Committee on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a critical time in the defense and security of our Nation. This is a very important bill. I urge the Members in this House to support this Defense authorization bill. It does so much to restore readiness, to support our men and women in uniform, and to protect the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400191" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as legislators, we meet once again to address the wide range of important national security activities undertaken by the Departments of Defense and Energy. We all take our legislative responsibilities very seriously, and this is especially true during a time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's always true of my good friend and colleague, Ike Skelton, the great gentleman from Missouri, our chairman. I want to thank Chairman Skelton for the excellent job that he's done in putting this bill together, and also thank all of our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members who have put together a composite that very strongly meets the needs of our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of Mr. Skelton's efforts to put forward this bill, our committee reported out the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 last Wednesday. The vote was unanimous, 58-0.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this bill. It reflects our committee's continued strong support for the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces, and in many ways this bill is a very good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It authorizes the President's request for $503.8 billion for the fiscal year 2008 base budget of the Department of Defense and national security programs of the Department of Energy. This amount provides for end-strength growth in both the Army and Marine Corps, continuing initiatives started several years ago by the Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fiscal year 2008, the Army would be authorized 525,400, which is 3,000 more than authorized last year, and the Marine Corps would be authorized 189,000, 9,000 more than last year. The bill also includes $142 billion to cover fiscal year 2008 war costs, as requested by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the initiatives in this legislation continue or build upon successful programs or reinforce good legislation that the House has already passed. For example, this legislation has provisions that are essential to maintain a robust defense industrial base. Last year, the Defense authorization bill tried to strike a fair balance between requiring the use of domestic specialty metals for our weapons systems and offering a waiver process in case sufficient metals are not available. <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>  establishes a formal rulemaking process for waivers that apply to multiple contracts to facilitate transparency and the gathering of broad industry input. In this way, the market will be able to respond to supply shortages, fostering investment in domestic industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other initiatives in this bill modify existing authorities or establish promising new programs and policies, such as adding $4.1 billion for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, so-called MRAPs. Separately, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill> levels the playing field between U.S. companies and foreign countries with which we have free trade agreements. It rectifies a critical flaw in the U.S. Code that effectively penalizes U.S. companies for complying with U.S. law, while allowing foreign manufacturers to provide  noncompliant components and systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These and other sections go a considerable way in ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform have the best available tools to protect our national security interests, but this bill is not a perfect bill. We can and we should improve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation cuts missile defense programs by almost $800 million. In 2006, there were about 100 foreign ballistic missile launches around the world, including from North Korea with short-range missiles and a longer-range TD-2 missile; and from Iran with its development and testing of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. I wonder whether in the face of this growing threat we should be slowing down the development and fielding of a robust, layered ballistic missile defense system that  would prove critical to our Nation's defenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill recommends a reduction of more than $860 million for the Army's Future Combat Systems program. In the past, our committee made smaller cuts to drive behaviors that would lead to a successful system. With the magnitude of this cut, I worry about the long-term impact on the capability of the U.S. Army and wonder whether we should not restore some of this funding to ensure that the Army is as prepared as possible to meet future challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, this bill provides significant resources for shipbuilding. I am concerned, however, that we have not fully funded two of the three additional ships that the language purports to have added. The bill is approximately $145 million less than the amount the Navy needs to buy and take delivery of an additional dry cargo ship, which was number two on the Navy's unfunded priority list. Also, the bill provides $588 million for advanced procurement for an additional ship-set of reactive plant  heavy components for a Virginia-class submarine in 2008, but it remains up to future Congresses to complete the funding and turn these components into an additional submarine before 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As in years past, I believe that this legislation reflects many of the Armed Services Committee's priorities in supporting our Nation's dedicated and courageous servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank again Chairman Skelton for putting together an excellent bill and helping us stay focused on delivering a bill that helps us protect, sustains and builds our forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve and pass <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today begins to address our growing concerns about the readiness posture of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the ranking member from my subcommittee, Mrs. Davis from Virginia, for her help in bringing together this excellent bill. I thank Chairman Skelton and Mr. Hunter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, our troops and their equipment have been stretched by extended combat operations, and the strain is evident in declining readiness, shortfalls in training and difficulties equipping our forces. These problems have grown to immense proportions, and this bill is a significant step to reverse the decline and rebuild our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Included in this bill are some significant readiness policy initiatives and investments that will help restore the readiness and posture of our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this bill establishes a Defense Readiness Production Board to identify critical readiness requirements and to mobilize the defense industrial base to speed up the production of military equipment. This board will bridge the gap between readiness needs and resources to help repair our worn out equipment that has been used time and time and time again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also creates a $1 billion Strategic Readiness Fund to give the board and the Department of Defense the ability to rapidly attend to pressing readiness needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill begins to address other shortfalls in maintenance and training by providing $250 million for unfunded training requirements and an additional $150 million to restore aviation maintenance shortfalls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are very concerned about the readiness of our National Guard. Our bill requires the Department of Defense to begin measuring the readiness of the National Guard units to support emergencies in their home States, such as the recent tragic tornadoes in Kansas. These readiness reports will allow the Congress and each State's Governor to evaluate the need of each State and address problems before a disaster occurs. To help restore the shortfalls, the bill includes a $1 billion investment in National  Guard equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also included provisions that require plans and reports to Congress on reconstituting our prepositioned war stocks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we also authorized more than $21 billion for military construction, family housing and to implement base realignment and closure. Those funds include money to support growth in force initiatives for the Army and the Marine Corps and to provide facilities to accommodate new recruits and missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other significant provisions include proposed changes to the National Security Personnel System and the depot initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a very, very good bill, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The bill before us today begins to address our growing concerns about the readiness posture of our armed forces. I would like to thank the ranking member from my subcommittee, Mrs. Davis from Virginia, for her help in bringing together this excellent bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops--and their equipment--have been stretched by extended combat operations ..... and the strain is evident in declining readiness, shortfalls in training and difficulties equipping our forces.

Other significant provisions include proposed changes to the National Security Personnel System, depot initiatives, and numerous important policy initiatives for the Department of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill, and I am pleased to have helped write it. It reflects our bipartisan desire to improve readiness and provide for our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400359" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the process that we've gone through to bring this bill to the floor has been an extensive one. We started under the leadership of Chairman Skelton in January, and as we moved through the days and the weeks, there were numerous, both full committee and subcommittee hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were visits here on Capitol Hill in our office and in other places by military leaders. There were visits by us to the Pentagon and to bases around the continental United States and, I might add, there were visits by us to our soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors who are serving overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were briefings too numerous to count, and a good process. And I want to just take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Chairman Skelton for the orderliness and the fairness with which this process was conducted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill, and I intend to support it. It provides for some new things, provides for some force protection measures that are so important in the war that we're now engaged in. It provides for additional money for the Stryker system. It provides for additional resources for up-armored Humvees, and it provides for steps forward in the new Joint Tactical Vehicle program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We added 10 more aircraft known as C-17s, which are strategic airlifters to get us to the fight. We took care of some personnel issues, including a significant pay raise for military personnel. And, because we're at war, and because we're using our military equipment, it wears out. It's a tough terrain that we're involved in in Iraq and Afghanistan, and so we included $3.6 billion for Army reset and $8.2 billion for Marine Corps reset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I might add that quality of life remains extremely important to the chairman, to the ranking member, and to all of us who serve on the committee, and so military construction dollars were added to provide the quality of life that is important to our military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it's a good bill, and I'm going to support it. If I were the person sitting at the desk writing the bill all by myself, I would have done some things differently. But that being said, it continues to be a bill that is worthy of everyone's support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have tried to find a way to include more money for the Future Combat System. We cut it by almost 25 percent. This is the Army's modernization program, and the first modernization program anything like it since World War II. It combines the use of technology that's available today with  some more traditional combat equipment, but it's good for the future. It's good for urban combat, it's good for being able to see the enemy who now has found ways  to hide on our conventional systems. And it's a big cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I would have also tried to add back the 9 percent that was reduced from the missile defense system. Today we have a missile defense system that actually will work once it is deployed, but we reduced it by 9 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chairman, once again I hope that the majority of our colleagues on this side of the aisle will support this bill. I think it is a good bill. It is one that is needed, particularly in these times when the United States of America is at war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his kind and supportive remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague, the gentleman from Arkansas, Dr. Snyder, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400383" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me begin by thanking Chairman IKE SKELTON for the work that he has done on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we can tell by the tone already, there has been a strong spirit of bipartisanship in putting this bill together. Both Ranking Member Duncan HUNTER and Chairman IKE SKELTON have worked very closely together to make this the kind of bill we want in time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, IKE, I just want to say Susie would be proud of the work that you have done on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my colleague, JOHN MCHUGH, the Congressman from New York, for the work that he has done and continues to do year after year. And as many of you know, his district includes Fort Drum that has done more than its fair share of sacrifice in this war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, a note about the staff. We all can talk about working together in a bipartisan manner, but for us it might mean just shaking hands as we go up and down the aisles. For the staff it is day in and day out, and I think they have done a great job of working together and trying to understand each other's concerns as this bill has come together; and I think the product reflects their great, great work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As somebody who spent 12 months and 20 days in Vietnam a long, long time ago at a time then also of a great foreign policy debate in our country, what I see in this body and in America today is something that a lot of us felt was lacking those 35 or 40 years ago. There is just this strong love of our troops and their families by the American people and by this Congress. And we recognize the need for a strong, well-trained, well-equipped military. And we have never forgotten the importance of  families, the importance of families to our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of one of my employees, who spent a year in Iraq, and he told me when he came home the first time for R&amp;R and he had two young children, he came off the plane and he had about a 150-yard walk down the aisle there in the airport, and he could not stop himself. He ran that last 150 yards so he could see his children that he had not seen in several months. And yet we know the sacrifices that our families bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So because of that, I think we have a lot of good things in this bill, whether it is dealing with medical care, TRICARE, the GI bill. I think it is a good, strong, bipartisan bill, and I appreciate all the work that the staff and Members have done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400191" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at this time, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett), the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400127" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank my good friend Mr. Hunter for yielding to me and thank him for his work and leadership on this legislation. And I would be remiss if I didn't thank the chairman of the committee, my good friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. I would like to congratulate the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Tauscher), on her first mark as chairman. She has been cooperative and straightforward, and that I appreciate. The effort has resulted in a product where we agree on far more than we disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This subcommittee tackles complex and often partisan issues, such as ballistic missile defense and nuclear weapons policy. This year's process has been further complicated due to the fact that our subcommittee allocation was cut by over $1 billion from the administration's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of missile defense, the bill continues a policy set forth by this committee last year that places a priority on near-term missile defense capabilities. The bill increases the request for Patriot PAC-3 by $11.8 million to buy four additional interceptors and adds $78 million to the President's request for Aegis ballistic missile defense and fully funds the request for THAAD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure also contains a reduction in funding for the proposed Third Site in Europe. I understand the chairman's rationale and her concern about moving forward without formal agreements with the host nations in place. However, I am pleased that my amendment was accepted during the full committee markup, which encourages DOD to seek a reprogramming request in the event that we reach agreements with the host nations in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support most of the provisions in this legislation, like many on my side of the aisle, I remain concerned about the $776 million top-line cut levied on the Missile Defense Agency, especially when progress is being made in so many areas of these programs. Now is not the time to have a further reduction in funding or slow down the development and fielding of these missile defense elements that are critical to our Nation's defense and the protection of our deployed forces and allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the time since last year's bill, we have seen a clear demonstration of the threat to our Nation, including North Korea's test of several short-range missiles and a longer-range Taepo-Dong-2 missile; Iran's continued development and test of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles; North Korea's nuclear test; and Iran's effort to continue uranium enrichment in the face of international criticism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the need to focus on near-term capabilities, but as we move the bill forward, we need to work together to identify the right balance between investments in our near-term systems and our future capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of space, the legislation contains a provision I strongly support which places a priority on protecting our space assets and increases funding for space situational awareness and operationally responsive space capabilities. Consistent with previous bipartisan efforts to improve space acquisition, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill> continues its emphasis on program execution. The bill reflects a measured approach to space acquisition that overlaps new modernization programs with continuing legacy programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill> fully funds Transformational Satellite, or TSAT, which has made significant progress in measuring and maturing critical technologies and following GAO's knowledge-based approach. It also supports Space Radar. Though the program details are classified, I believe Space Radar's all-weather, day-and-night, 24/7 surveillance and reconnaissance capability is vital for the protection of our forces and supporting intelligence users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure reflects a bipartisan agreement on the Atomic Energy Defense Activities, particularly on RRW, the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. RRW has the potential to increase the reliability, safety, and security of our nuclear weapons stockpile and reduce the likelihood of testing. RRW funding is reduced but maintained at a level to allow NNSA to take a measured, knowledge-based approach by focusing on detailed design and cost estimates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill. We agree on more than we disagree, and I would urge Members on my side to support the bill.</paragraph>
