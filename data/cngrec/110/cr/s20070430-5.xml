    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4:15, with Senators allowed to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. At 4:15 the Senate will begin consideration of the FDA authorization. The chairman and ranking member, Senators Kennedy and Enzi, have worked very hard to get the bill here. They did great work over the weekend. Two very important issues that would have made this bill much more complex, it appears, have been worked out. I hope  that is the case. One deals with drug reimportation; the other deals with biomedicine. We think they have worked that out. Time will tell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no rollcall votes today. There will be a vote probably prior to the recess tomorrow. If we don't have something on the FDA bill, we have a Federal district court judge we need to vote on and we can get that out of the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FDA legislation is extremely important. It appears we have the opportunity to do some bipartisan work in that regard.</paragraph>
