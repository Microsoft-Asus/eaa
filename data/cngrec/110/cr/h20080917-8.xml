    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the dedication of so many volunteers who eight times a year line the streets of Manteca, California, with 2,400 flags in a stunning display of patriotism. Flags Over Manteca began after September 11 to recognize those who lost their lives on that day and all Americans who have sacrificed in service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each morning on days of remembrance during the year, volunteers and service groups place flags along eight miles of Manteca's main roads to celebrate our country's heroes. Coordinating it all is the Manteca Chamber of Commerce and volunteer Les Thomas who arrives early to ensure that everyone knows what to do. He is there at the end of the day to receive all 2,400 flags and carefully pack them away until the next holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The event has become so meaningful that volunteers arrive at 4:30 in the morning to have the privilege of placing flags in honor of those who will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I commend all those who make Flags Over Manteca work. I hope it continues to memorialize the sacrifices of our Nation's heroes.</paragraph>
