  <narrative>HONORING KAREN HONTZ -- (Senate - March 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1997">S1997</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding service Karen Hontz has provided to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship in her capacity as a detailee from the Small Business Administration, SBA. Karen came to the Senate last June and quickly established herself as an invaluable asset from her first days on the job when the committee held a roundtable and subsequent markup on venture capital legislation. As Congress prepares to take a short recess, Karen  will begin her transition back to the SBA, as well as her 20th year of distinguished service to the Federal Government. This will certainly be SBA Administrator Preston's gain and my and my staff's loss. Thank you Administrator Preston for allowing us to work with Karen over the last 9 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I reflect on Karen's tenure, I will always remember how she far exceeded all expectations, working long hours to provide me with clear and succinct materials about critical issues facing America's small businesses. This was particularly impressive given the volume of activity before the committee and the fact that Karen was new to the Senate. Indeed, since Karen came to Capitol Hill, the committee held seven oversight hearings on issues ranging from Government contracting, to women's business  ownership and grant programs, to the SBA's budget. The committee also held two markups, sending venture capital, entrepreneurial development, and contracting legislation to the Senate floor. My staff and I could not have navigated these committee actions without Karen's sage counsel and invaluable insight gained from years of experience at the SBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only was Karen extremely helpful in assisting me with committee hearings and markups, but she also played an integral role in moving legislation on the Senate floor, a rare feat for a new employee. For example,  Karen, together with other members of my staff, successfully negotiated with House and Senate committee, floor, and leadership staff with respect to controversial provisions in the Military Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization  and Opportunity Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="4253">H.R. 4253</bill>, critical legislation that will expand business opportunities for veterans and help reservists keep their businesses afloat during and after deployment. Karen was instrumental in helping the Senate to clear this bill by unanimous consent in late January before President Bush signed it into law in mid-February. Karen was also pivotal in helping to include a bipartisan and bicameral</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would also be remiss in not pointing out that there are often concerns when an executive branch employee comes to the Senate for a work assignment, as Congress and the administration sometimes approach issues from differing viewpoints. Karen carefully and gracefully fulfilled her fiduciary duties relating to confidential information received from the two branches of Government, which could not be shared between those entities. She was also able to give fair and balanced advice, explaining  in an unbiased manner both sides of an issue. In addition to Karen's in-depth knowledge of the SBA, she also provided broader insight into executive branch operations, including the Federal rulemaking and administrative processes, as well as the Office of Management and Budget's role in the budget and appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Karen has truly been a vital part of my team and has provided a unique viewpoint and voice that has truly broadened this committee's grasp on the SBA and small business issues. Karen's extraordinary performance has far exceeded my expectations, and she will be greatly missed. I wish Karen and her husband Stephen all the best as she returns to the SBA.</paragraph>
