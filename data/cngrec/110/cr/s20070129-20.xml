    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to honor Helen Fenske, the grandmother of environmentalism in my great home State of New Jersey. I join with New Jerseyeans and environmentalists everywhere in mourning her passing on January 19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Helen was truly a pioneer in understanding the importance of preserving our environmental resources for future generations. Her activism began in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had plans to build a jetport on swampy land in Chatham Township, in Morris County, NJ. But not on Helen Fenske's watch. Self-described as "the little old lady in sneakers," she understood that the swamp was a treasure--an environmentally sensitive area--and that a jetport  would be an ecological disaster to the region. With dogged determination, Helen Fenske mobilized a group of likeminded residents in the Green Village vicinity. In a grassroots effort that included raising money, creating awareness, and lobbying to retain</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is, indeed, a treasure and was the first refuge to receive national wilderness recognition--signed into law by President Johnson in 1968. This was the culmination of Helen Fenske's efforts to save the Great Swamp. Thanks to Helen's perseverance and vision, today, one can walk on a boardwalk through vast portions of the swamp to enjoy the natural wildlife that inhabits it, including 244 species of birds, mammals such as red fox, coyote, beaver, raccoons,  fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and many large oak and beech trees, and plants such as mountain laurel, mosses, and ferns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Helen Fenske's legend did not stop with the Great Swamp. She went on to become an environmental advocate assuming key leadership positions in State government, as special assistant to the first commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Richard Sullivan, and Assistant Commissioner for Natural and Historic Resources. Her leadership became the inspiration for a myriad of conservation efforts, including the battle to save Sunfish Pond along the Appalachian Trail at  the Delaware Water Gap. She was additionally the inspiration for the formation of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation and was involved with the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions, Patriot's Path, the Hudson River Walkway, the Morris Parks and Land Conservancy, and the preservation of the Highlands along with many other efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For her groundbreaking efforts as a champion of the environment, Helen Fenske was the deserving honoree of numerous awards, including the Marcellus Hartley Dodge Award from the Great Swamp Watershed Association; a Congressional Citation for her work in saving the Great Swamp and the creation of the American Revolution Heritage Corridor; the Achievement Award of the Washington Association; and honorary degrees from Ramapo College and Drew University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after she moved to New Hampshire, she remained in touch with her New Jersey roots, always connected to her fight to preserve the Great Swamp and its environs. She died in New Hampshire, but left a living legacy in New Jersey. She will be greatly missed, but the legacy of the "old lady in sneakers" has been passed on to a new generation of environmentalists who have taken on her very important mission.</paragraph>
