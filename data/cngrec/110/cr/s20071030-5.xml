  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13531">S13531</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 60 minutes, with the first half of the time under the control of the Republicans and the second half controlled by the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the time that we have, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy have 20 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Amtrak legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, in a short period of time, the Senate considered and adopted nine amendments to the legislation. A number of other amendments remain to be considered. I believe the managers share my view that action on this bill can, hopefully, be concluded during today's session. Therefore, it is estimated that the number of votes with respect to amendments and the pending cloture motion could occur prior to the Senate recessing for the caucus meetings. Members have until 12 noon to file germane  second-degree amendments to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last evening, I had a conversation with my counterpart, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and indicated to him that we are going to move to and complete SCHIP this week in some form or fashion. That may require some time into the weekend. We can change everything by unanimous consent. We will see what the mood of the Senate is. Everybody should be alerted that unless Senator McConnell and I and the other 98 Members can work something out, we may have to  be here this weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been very fortunate that we have not had to have many weekend sessions this year. That is really good. If we can get our work done, that is fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have an obligation to move to the farm bill. Every 5 years, we have to complete that, and we are going to do our very best to do it in a way that makes a lot of sense. In the next 2 weeks, after this week, there are other things we have to do. We have to send an appropriations bill to the President and get that conference started. Some say no matter what we send him, he will veto it. That may be the case, but at least we will get the process going to see if we can work out something rather  than a number of short-term CRs to complete the funding of the Government. I hope we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have other things we need to work on that are extremely important to do. Some of that must be done before we leave on November 16. We have a lot of work to do. I have had both Democrats and Republicans talk to me, saying: My legislation is important, let's get it done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is difficult to do. The rules have developed in the Senate over 230 years, and I think they have served the country well, as you look back. When you are right in the trenches trying to work through this, sometimes it is very difficult. We will try to be as fair and inclusive to everybody as we can during the next 2 1/2  weeks.</paragraph>
