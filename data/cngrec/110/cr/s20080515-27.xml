  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DR. CARL V. PATTON -- (Senate - May 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4279">S4279</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to honor in the Record of the Senate a great educator in the State of Georgia. On June 30, 2008, Dr. Carl V. Patton will retire as president of Georgia State University after 16 years of outstanding service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Patton has led Georgia State University in its transition from a commuter school into a vibrant research university that is home to more than 28,000 students representing every county in the State, every State in the Nation, and 160 countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgia State has grown into one of this Nation's leading urban research universities, reflecting Dr. Patton's vision for a partnership between Atlanta and the university. Instead of designing walls to keep the city and its urban ways separate from the campus, he has insisted that the university fully integrate its research, teaching and service mission into the fabric of the urban environment of its downtown Atlanta home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the university has grown physically, it has grown in stature as well. The College of Law, which was in its infancy when Dr. Patton became president in 1992, is now ranked within the top 100 law schools. The Andrew Young School of Public Policy, founded in 1996, has grown from an idea to an internationally recognized program that works in over 30 countries around the globe as well as at home in the areas of health care, environment, air quality, taxation, aging, education, child care, and diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The J. Mack Robinson College of Business continues to rank among the best in both graduate and undergraduate offerings, with two programs ranked in the top 10 by US News and World Report. The College of Health and Human Sciences leads the country  in research on urban health issues such as HIV, health care shortages, criminal justice, social work and nutrition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgia State's College of Arts and Sciences hosts one of only two bio-safety level 4 labs, which will move shortly into a new Science Park that this Congress has seen fit to support. The new Science Park promises to bring cutting-edge research in the bio and neurosciences and will facilitate the growth of bio-technology in Atlanta and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the College of Education is hard at work partnering with urban schools to provide a clinical, supervised method for training our future teachers to ensure the success and longevity of these new teacher careers and, most importantly, the long-term success of our children who live within our major urban centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Patton has lived his life in the way he hopes his students live theirs, tirelessly volunteering for service in his community through organizations such as Central Atlanta Progress, the Rotary and the Grady Memorial Hospital Corporation. However, his example and his hard work will not stop at retirement, as he plans to continue to live downtown and assist Georgia State in its future endeavors to raise capital and to expand its student body to tackle the tough issues of our times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the Senate floor the contributions of Dr. Carl V. Patton to higher education in Georgia. He has served Georgia State University, the city of Atlanta, the State of Georgia and the United States of America very well. Dr. Patton has earned the many happy years of retirement ahead of him.</paragraph>
