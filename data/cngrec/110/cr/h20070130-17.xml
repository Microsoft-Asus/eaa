  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tomorrow this House will take up a massive spending bill that will remove over $400 billion from our Treasury. This huge 150-page "CRomnibus" spending bill has not been read by most Democrats or Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told that despite the end of the 100 hours, this large bill cannot be amended. We have had no hearings on this bill. There is no report to accompany the legislation detailing hundreds of billions in spending, and we will not be allowed to offer improvements like taking the savings in canceling Federal earmarks and making sure the deficit is reduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In large part, Members of this House may be later embarrassed when enterprising reporters who have the time to read this legislation find out what we have actually done without review or consideration. This bill is not pay-as-you-go. Given the Democratic retreat coming up, it is more like pay-and-then-play.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
