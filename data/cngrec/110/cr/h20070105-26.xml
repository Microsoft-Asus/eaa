    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the Appalachian State Mountaineers football team, who recently defeated the Massachusetts Minutemen in a 28-17 victory. What makes this a magnificent triumph is that this is the second straight year the Mountaineers have brought home the NCAA Division 1 football championship subdivision, formerly recognized as Division 1-AA. The Mountaineers finished their season with a 14-1 record, losing only their first game of the  season and going undefeated all the way through to the championship game after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to represent Appalachian State University, as they have not only a stellar academic program but also have succeeded in athletics as well. This shows the diversity and accomplishments of Appalachian State as they exemplify a true student body where life lessons are learned through extracurricular activities as well as rigorous academic study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to recognize the momentous accomplishments of junior Kevin Richardson who scored all four touchdowns and had 179 rushing yards that led the Mountaineers to victory in the championship game. Although Massachusetts had started the game with an early lead, the Mountaineers persevered, worked as a team, and never gave up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mountaineers had tremendous support from their fellow classmates, alumni and residents of Boone, North Carolina. Not only have they received this support on their home field, Kidd Brewer Stadium, the gridiron, but also when the Mountaineers traveled for their games. At the playoff game, an enormous crowd of 22,808 included over 15,000 Appalachian State Black and Gold dressed fans at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga, Tennessee. With great anticipation of another Mountaineer victory, the attendance  set a record for Finley Stadium at the University of Tennessee where the game was played. While the game was played and won by the Appalachian State football team, the tremendous support of friends, family, alumni and North Carolina residents set an exciting tone and surely assisted the team by showing their dedicated support. Also notable was that this was the 12th time in the 15 games this season that the Mountaineers played before a sold out crowd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest congratulations to all the Mountaineers who played with dedication, perseverance and, most of all, heart. I also applaud the tremendous coaching staff, including head coach Jerry Moore, who has been with Appalachian State University for 18 years, serving the athletic program with enthusiasm and steadfast commitment. His service, along with the entire coaching staff, has been invaluable in guiding the team to their great successes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, again, Appalachian State Mountaineers for your tremendous success in back to back NCAA titles. You are definitely a source of pride for western North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also my pleasure to commend the Wake Forest Demon Deacon football team on an outstanding season. Prior to the start of the season, the Deacons were predicted to finish last in their division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. However, they were not discouraged by these predictions and actually seemed to revel in the role of the underdog. Ultimately, Wake Forest shocked the Nation by finishing the regular season 11-2, which placed them at the top of the Atlantic Division in the ACC. They  then defeated the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in the Atlantic Coast Conference Champion game, making Wake Forest ACC champions for the first time since 1970.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the team's success this year is due to its resilience, tenacity, and impeccable coaching. Wake Forest coach Jim Grobe was unanimously named ACC Coach of the Year and beat out a strong group of national contenders to be named the 2006 NCAA National Coach of the Year. Coach Grobe and the Deacons battled injuries to several key players, including their starting quarterback and starting tailback, but bounced back in the face of adversity to set a school record for victories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After such an unbelievable season, no one was surprised when the Deacons  were chosen to play the 2007 Orange Bowl. The reigning ACC champs traveled down to Miami, with their fans in tow, to face the champions of the Big East Conference, the Louisville Cardinals. Wake Forest came into the game well prepared and played like the champions they are. While Louisville emerged victorious, Wake fans and players alike left Miami with their heads held high, proud  of a season full of accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Orange Bowl culminated a magical season for the Demon Deacons, one that Wake fans will never forget. Finishing the regular season 11-2, serving Florida State its first-ever shutout at home under the leadership of Coach Bobby Bowden, winning the ACC championship and appearing in the Orange Bowl can be considered highlights. But by no means could these achievements capture the spirit and the emotion of this phenomenal season for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. The sentiments of this season can  best be summed up in the 10 minutes following the Orange Bowl on January 2. Even though the Deacons lost, Wake fans remained in the stands after the game, standing and cheering in support of the team that brought them so much joy this season as Wake players walked to their side of the stadium to thank the fans for their steadfast support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This relationship underlines what it means to be a Deacon fan. Wins and losses ultimately aren't all that matter, but rather the sense of pride and family that comes along with being a Deacon is what makes the Wake Forest team and the fans such a special group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, Go Deacs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There may have been a few tears shed in Dolphins Stadium following this year's Orange Bowl, but they were not tears of sadness. They were tears of pride and accomplishment, and they were very hard earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to Wake Forest, and best of luck next season. We know it will be every bit as exciting as this one. Go Deacs!</paragraph>
