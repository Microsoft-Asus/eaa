  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. Although we have made significant headway over the last 5 years, the HIV/AIDS pandemic remains one of the world's worst public health crises, with millions of people infected around the globe and millions more who have already perished. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa, and because of the disease's disproportionate  impact on sub-Saharan Africa, I would like to focus my remarks today on that region to illustrate just how critical--and urgent--it is that we pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite some progress, AIDS remains a severe public health concern in Africa. Indeed, HIV continues to spread, with many countries on the continent experiencing unprecedented drops in population, economic decline, decimation of militaries, and the creation of an entire generation of orphans who know no other life but that of the streets. These societal disruptions have profound consequences for the continent's future and security; already, they are impeding development in the part of the world  least able to contain the epidemic or treat its victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December 2007, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS--UNAIDS--reported that worldwide, approximately 35 million people live with HIV/AIDS. Similar organizations report that at the current rate, by 2015 more than 62 million people could become newly infected. Currently, over two-thirds of HIV cases are in Africa, which means there are somewhere between 20 million and 24 million adults and children in that continent who are HIV-positive. And these are just the cases we know of--these  are just the reported and documented cases. As a point of comparison, the region with the next highest infection rate is Southeast Asia--with some 4 million individuals living with HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2003 there has been a significant bipartisan effort to address this crisis with the creation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS--or PEPFAR as it is more commonly known. PEPFAR authorized some $19 billion over 5 years for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis  and malaria and yet in 2007 alone, 2.5 million people around the globe were infected with HIV--or the equivalent of some 6,800 per day, 4,600 of whom live in Africa. And while 4,600 Africans are being infected every day, some 6,000 Africans are dying from AIDS-related illness--many without ever realizing they were HIV-positive or, if they did know, without ever having access to any treatment for their illness. In other words, despite a ground-breaking initiative to raise the profile of the disease,  to work with local communities and national health systems, and to coordinate among the international community, Africa's future remains in peril.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HIV/AIDS is spreading in African countries that are already hard hit by a range of other problems including rampant poverty, political instability and a lack of basic services and education. The result is decreased state capacity and an undermining of the development of civil society. HIV does not discriminate, and it is hitting members of Africa's political leadership, its college-trained professionals, and its skilled labor forces. And as it takes its toll on these groups, it is having a devastating  effect on entire generations. I saw this firsthand just under a decade ago when I traveled to Zimbabwe, and I have seen it since in other trips to Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that time, reports were noting that life expectancy had dropped from 65 to 39 because of the epidemic. As I walked past the parliament building in Harare, I asked how old one had to be to become a legislator. The answer? Forty. And now, even as it copes with a new, devastating political and humanitarian crisis, Zimbabwe is experiencing even lower life expectancy rates--37 for men and just 34 for women--even lower than the minimum age to be elected a member of Parliament in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the critical assistance of the United States, the cold hard facts--the numbers of those infected and dying--show that even more help is needed  from the international community. Last August, on a trip to Uganda, I met with a number of health experts--from government health workers to civil society representatives--to discuss how the United States can build on the good work that began with PEFPAR, and provide a more vigorous response to the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We discussed what had worked and what had not, and they told me very clearly that in order to put a dent in the devastating impact of this pandemic, we need to focus not only on treatment but equally, if not more, on prevention. They shared examples of why, in order to help those most vulnerable, HIV/AIDS efforts need to include programs that address gender inequity, family planning, food and nutrition, and social stigma. And they were unequivocally clear that we need to work closely with national  governments and local communities to help  build strong, sustainable health infrastructures that can provide assistance to their own citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention Uganda because it has been a rare example of success on the continent. The government's early recognition of the crisis and its initial comprehensive policies--including a well-organized public education campaign--are credited with helping to bring adult HIV prevalence down from around 15 percent in the early 1990s to just over 5 percent in 2001. Unfortunately by 2006, scientists were suggesting that Uganda's HIV prevalence rates were once again rising. Indeed, I heard that same concern  from most, if not all, of the people I met there, as well as from the President of Uganda himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying message was that focusing on treatment is not enough. In the case of Uganda, given the rising infection rates--as with many other parts of the world--the emphasis on treatment fails to address the factors driving the epidemic. Don't get me wrong--Ugandans are grateful for U.S. HIV/AIDS funding--but they made it clear that future support would be more effective if it were more comprehensive, and corresponded more closely to national needs, conditions, and initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has become a common refrain that we cannot treat our way out of this global pandemic and I continue to believe that is the case. As long as infection rates are rising, treatment and care costs will increase, as will the  disease's burden on key vulnerable populations as well as their families, communities, and countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scientific evidence supports the anecdotal evidence I heard from many in Uganda. It confirms there is much to be gained by integrating the treatment and care of other diseases--particularly tuberculosis but also more common, preventable ailments--with HIV programs and expanded informational awareness campaigns that encourage health knowledge and capacities. Part of the challenge of addressing HIV/AIDS is that the disease does not sit easily within any particular policy area and although there  are important domestic components related to health and human services, these are also clearly questions of foreign policy and international assistance. All of these need to be integrated into a harmonious whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is why today I encourage my colleagues to support The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Reauthorization Act and to reject any amendments that would undermine this bipartisan legislation. This bill is not perfect but, if passed, it will put global AIDS programs on the road to greater sustainability and will significantly increase our commitment to reversing the crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know there can be no quick fix or shortcut to success, but we have before us now legislation that maintains and expands the United States' response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Passing this bill will ensure the continuation of U.S. leadership to prevent, contain, and combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in a way that advances a broader range of global health and development objectives. To do anything less would not only be bad policy, it would be short-sighted and counter-productive.</paragraph>
