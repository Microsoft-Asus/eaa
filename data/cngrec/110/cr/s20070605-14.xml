  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I got a very early phone call from my daughter in Italy. Of course, their time is 6 hours ahead of ours, and they heard about Craig before we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have listened to some of my colleagues talking about Craig. You know, there are some people you have more in common with than others. I can recall Craig and I both came to the House of Representatives about the same time. Then we both decided we would run for the Senate in 1994. That was a decision we made. We talked to each other and we decided that that would be the best thing for us to do and perhaps we would be able to articulate our concerns a little bit more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a marine, I was in the Army. We had a lot in common. I think it was Mitch McConnell or perhaps Harry Reid this morning who talked about his calm toughness, his way of expressing himself. I have always been very envious. I would come down, and I would watch Craig Thomas on the floor. He would say things as antagonistically, as offensively as I would, except people loved him when he said it and they hated me when I said it. I was never able to master that. I watched  him day after day, month after month, and year after year being able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Mike Enzi is right when he said Craig Thomas was the voice of the Senate. Let me correct Senator McConnell on one thing he said. I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee when Craig Thomas was on that committee. This morning Mitch McConnell said he was as much at home on a horse as he was in a committee meeting. Well, let me correct you because he was much more at home on a horse than he would be in that committee meeting. I can  remember seeing him staring off, and then I would go over and visit while some people were testifying, perhaps on the other side, and he would tell me his stories. He was a real cowboy. A lot of us ride horses in parades; he was a real cowboy and such a great guy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many years ago, I was mayor of Tulsa. We had our annual meeting in Ketchum, ID. I was flying a plane up there, when we were weathered in in Saratoga, WY. Saratoga, WY, is a town that Lewis &amp; Clark came through at the bend of the river. I fell in love with that town. For the next 7 years that I served in the capacity of being mayor, I always purposefully stayed in Saratoga, WY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went up to him in the House of Representatives in the 1980s, and I said: Craig, you know when I was in--when I would stop, make my stop in Saratoga, WY, and stay at the Wolf Hotel--I might add, I would stay at the Wolf Hotel in the presidential suite; it was the only one with a bathroom in it. I told him almost everyone I would run into on the streets of Saratoga, WY, reminded me of Craig Thomas. These are salt-of-the-earth people, wonderful people, people I learned to dearly  love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kay told me this morning, when we heard about Craig, she said: You probably forgot this, but when you were in voting on the day that we had the spouses dinner, that was 2 weeks ago today, on Tuesday, I saw him walking across the parking lot while I was waiting for you to vote, and he was walking a little slower than usual. I said: Hey, handsome. And his whole face lit up. And he came over and he embraced Kay. That is the way that he was to a lot of people. So let me say this to Peter,  Paul, Patrick and Lexie and Susan. Susan, you have some people you have heard from this morning who dearly love you and would love to have some way of comforting you. We know how difficult it is. We will pray for you, for your kids. I have to say this also, I do not think it has been said yet about Craig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas was probably the most consistent Member of the Senate prayer breakfast because he was always there. Mike Enzi knows this because he is the chairman now. He was always there. I give the Scripture at this thing. So we knew that if we did not see Craig Thomas anyplace else during the week, we would see him at the Senate Prayer Breakfast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Prayer Breakfast is similar to a lot of these things. It is based on Acts 2:42. Acts 2:42 is the genesis of these meetings you do on a regular basis. You get together and you do four things: eat together, pray together, fellowship together, and talk about the precepts of Jesus together. We talked about the precepts of Jesus together every Wednesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the comfort I had with Craig Thomas. Some people, you wonder if they are going to be there. But Thomas  you didn't wonder, you knew. So, Craig, all I can say is, this is not goodbye, this is, "We will see you later."</paragraph>

  <chair> Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Alaska is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it was with great sadness that Catherine and I learned of Senator Craig Thomas' passing last night. The people of Wyoming have lost a tireless advocate and a skilled leader. Those of us in the Senate have lost a true friend and a genuine inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig and I remained close throughout our time as colleagues. I visited with him on matters pertaining to resource development and ranches probably more than any other Member of the Senate. These weren't visits concerning legislation, but simply to share experiences and to get advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Craig came to the Senate much after I did, he possessed a wealth of knowledge, particularly about the West. I had the privilege of marrying into a family with small ranches in Arizona. Craig and I talked often about horses, the problems facing ranches and cowboys, and how they can endure in today's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In each of the past several years, Craig has introduced a resolution designating a National Day of the American Cowboy. More than any other member of this body, Craig recognized there is more to cowboys than roping, riding, and branding. From the Wild West to the Last Frontier, cowboys have long symbolized the spirit and determination which makes our Nation great. It was my pleasure to help sponsor Craig's resolutions, and this year, on July 28, we will pay special  tribute to a man who truly embodied the American cowboy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was always mindful of the best interests of other Western States. As a Senator from Wyoming, he represented a State with a great many problems in common with those of us from Alaska. Craig was renowned for his legislative efforts regarding national parks. His efforts to improve rural health care greatly benefitted his constituents and continue to serve as a model for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, I remember working with Craig on resource issues related to coal, oil, and land management. He was steadfast in his efforts to increase domestic energy production. He fought to secure funding for a coal gasification plant in his home State, and he also supported exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To deal with Craig Thomas was to deal with a gentleman, a person who had absolute knowledge of the topics he spoke on. You couldn't talk to him without becoming aware you were talking to a marine. As far as I am concerned, marines have something special about them--an absolute steadfastness, honesty, and integrity. Craig exemplified these qualities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard for me to realize he is now gone. Just before I left to go home this past recess, I stopped Craig and told him we are praying for him and to hang in there. Our great friend Susan Butcher also died of leukemia. She went through the same process Craig did. He told me he was going to stick with it. He thought he was going to be able to beat it. Everyone who met with Craig in the period after he was diagnosed with leukemia had to admire his courage, his absolute  courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's concept of life impressed me most. He lived life to the fullest. He had a wonderful family, four wonderful children, and a wonderful wife in Susan. He was also the essence of a Westerner. I have known many Westerners in my day, but never one who was as consummate a Westerner as Craig Thomas. The people of Wyoming were blessed to have him representing their interests. Whenever he went home, Craig traveled throughout his State, from one small community to the  next. We compared notes about how Wyoming residents faced problems similar to those of the people of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Craig's passing, the Senate has lost a great leader in terms of Western values. But we have also lost a man who was a friend. He had the qualities everyone cherishes in a friend. And as the Senator from Oklahoma has said, he was very devout. You couldn't talk to Craig without realizing he had tremendous faith in our Maker. He was guided by this faith, and it kept him going during the past few months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also hard to understand that leukemia is such a violent disease. This year alone, more than 44,000 Americans will be diagnosed with leukemia. The type of cancer which afflicted Craig, acute myeloid leukemia, has a 5-year survival rate of just 21 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is anything I would add to what is going to be said today, it is that we must do more. We must do more to prevent this disease. We must learn as much as possible, and apply as much research as possible, because very few people survive their tremendous battle with leukemia. Of all people, I really believed Craig might. When I left for the Memorial Day recess, I had a good feeling--Craig was going to make it. He told me he would soon start another round of chemotherapy,  but because of his strong faith, he had no fear of what lay ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the Senate takes a lesson from Craig Thomas' attitude as he faced this adversity. After being diagnosed with leukemia, Craig faced trials and tribulations we can hardly imagine, and we will remember him as an example of a man with great moral strength and great faith in God. In honor of his memory, it is my hope we will join together and find a way to apply more funds to research leukemia, whose devastating impact has now taken a good friend from our Senate family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, the Casper Star-Tribune published several individuals' recollections of Craig. One of his former staff members, Liz Brimmer, said, "In unassuming and generous ways, he did more for Wyoming, more for Wyoming people, than most people knew. His positive spirit permeated every interaction. Fiercely loyal and generous of spirit, Craig was funny and tenacious all in the same moment ..... He loved people and loved to make a difference. What better mark of a man?" I  wish I could find words as eloquent and as fitting to describe this extraordinary Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all mourn his death, and we send our love and best wishes to his family. Susan had a husband, and his children had a father, without equal. Craig Thomas was a family man through and through, and I am deeply saddened by his passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I thought about him this morning, who he was and what he meant to the Senate, a few words came to mind. In a place of great debate and heightened political excitement, Craig Thomas was always a gentleman. That says something. It certainly is something we will remember. In a time and place where we often raise our voices in anger and emotion, Craig Thomas was always soft spoken, but he was always heard. In a time when many of us fail even our own standards in terms of integrity,  he was a man of high integrity, honorable and humble. In a place where many show weakness, he always showed strength, that quiet strength of a Wyoming cowboy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought about his last battle with cancer. You could tell, when you saw him on the floor or passed him in the hallway, the therapy had taken its toll on him personally. Yet there was always a smile on his face, a determination to overcome the odds, and a very optimistic and positive word when you asked him how he was doing. Those are the things I remember about Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We serve with many people. They come and go. The annals of history do not record them all as great, but each one of us is lucky to be here and lucky to develop the friendships and relationships we do. Politically, Craig Thomas and I were worlds apart. There might not be any starker contrast in voting records than Craig Thomas and mine, but it didn't make much difference when it came to his friendship and his personal relationship. I am going to miss him. I am going to miss that  Wyoming cowboy who had the Remington bronzes in his office that I walked by and looked at every time I came down the corridor. I will miss his smile and his courage. But I am going to be reminded by his example of how we can all be a little bit better in what we do here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my sympathies to his wife Susan, his family, his staff, and all of his friends. He was truly a great Senator. I was honored to count him as a friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In the third chapter of the book of Ecclesiastes, the Bible teaches us that there is a time for everything; a time to live and a time to die, a time to reap and a time to sow. Last night became the time that Craig Thomas left us. For that we are all sorry and extend our sympathy to Susan and all his family and the people of Wyoming. But for all of us today and for years to come, it will be a time for us to reap the benefits of having known Craig Thomas, having benefited  from his service as a colleague in the Senate, but for the people of Wyoming as a great servant to that State. I don't know if there are two finer people who ever served the Senate than Mike Enzi and Craig Thomas. To have a matched set of rock-solid, quiet but humble, and strong men to serve a State is quite a unique privilege for that State and a unique privilege for all of us who serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this sad occasion of the passing of a great Senator and a great friend, I know I will benefit and reap for years to come from the service, the passion, and the integrity of Craig Thomas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am saddened by the passing of a good friend, Senator Thomas. I express my condolences to his family, the people of Wyoming, Senator Enzi, and to all of us who knew him and loved him. I have not served long with Senator Thomas. It was a joy to hear this morning how he was described by Senator Enzi, who has known him for a long time. My memories of him are as someone who always was kind, always friendly, offered me a helping hand on my first days  in the Senate. I know he has been described as an authentic cowboy. I certainly always viewed him as that. He seemed to be the real deal, the real McCoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember speaking before the break with the Senator, telling him how good he looked. Of course, he already knew he was headed back to another bout of chemo, but he didn't dwell on that. He was telling me that he was feeling good, and he did look good. He looked a lot better than he had been, and we were all encouraged. He certainly believed in that assessment as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last few months, he has been "down the road" from us, and he has been responsible for the candy drawer, a little Senate tradition. As we were talking before the break, standing there, he was commenting on his pride in the Wyoming taffy candy he had introduced to the candy drawer. He was a Wyoming promoter to the very end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I relish the good memories. I know we are all sad today at this incredible loss. My heart goes out to the members of his family. We will do all we can to support all those who loved him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, on behalf of Kathy and myself, we send our deepest condolences and expressions of sympathy to Susan and her family on Craig's passing. Susan and Craig were good friends of ours. Susan is and Craig still is. They are special people. They are people whom you like to call friends, the type of people who are there. And they had a special relationship. I don't know how many votes we cast together. It was a lot. Craig arrived 2 years after  I had. We would walk out of this Chamber together very often, and Susan, because she was here in Washington, would almost always be right out there, right outside the door, with a great smile to greet us, even though we probably just lost the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was special because, as has been mentioned and said so well by his partner Senator Enzi and his colleagues, Senator McConnell, Senator Inhofe, Senator Stevens, Senator Isakson, Senator Martinez, and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, and Senator Durbin, everybody respected him. You may not have agreed with him, but you could not help but respect him. He was quiet but accomplished and understood the issues.  He was a man of inordinate common sense. When he would look at an issue, he would cut through all the puffery, all the theater, of which there is a fair amount around here, and he would get to the essence of the question. Then he would bring common sense to the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the great good fortune--I don't know how it happened, but it was good fortune for me--to end up spending almost every Tuesday lunch, where we do policy, and almost every Wednesday lunch, where we do steering and get together as Members of the Republican Senate to discuss whatever is happening, to sit beside Craig. We sort of gravitated to each other. That is sort of ironic, me being from New England and him from Wyoming, but I think there is a certain, hopefully, identity of our  approaches to events. I am certainly proud to say that. The great fun about sitting beside Craig was that not only did he have this wonderful common sense, but he had an extraordinary sense of humor. He would listen to statements made, often by our leadership--I do not wish to be disparaging here; I am simply being kind--and he</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This disease attacked him, but honestly, you couldn't convince him that it attacked him. You would ask him how he was doing. He would say: I am OK. Even though you knew he was going through extraordinary pain, you would never, ever--at least I never, ever--hear him complain. He was a genuine marine in that sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will obviously be missed around here. He was a low-key person who had a high-level impact. I will certainly miss him. I will miss him at those lunches and I will miss seeing Susan outside the door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Susan and his family, Kathy and I say: He was a great friend, and we will miss him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise to honor my friend Craig Thomas, the Senator from Wyoming who passed away last night, and to express my sympathy to Susan, his wife, and to his family and to the people of Wyoming. Joan and I and my staff feel we have had a very special relationship with Craig and Susan and his staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two weeks ago the Senate passed <bill type="sr" number="130">S. Res. 130</bill> declaring July 28 as National Day of the American Cowboy. This was the last piece of legislation Senator Thomas pushed through the Senate. It is so true to his spirit. Senator Thomas was himself a cowboy, a roper. He understood that as a symbol of the American West, cowboys represent much more than men on horses. They stand for courage, determination, hard work, and respect for nature. They stand for the West itself and for those who  wish to protect and preserve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His work on the Energy and Environment Committees was a testament as well to his belief that the land we have been blessed with needs stewardship and care, and that those who live on and work with the land are often the best at doing so. Craig tried to take care of the land, especially the Wyoming he loved so much. This connection with the West, his concern for land management, and the way of life of those who lived on the land, should be his legacy. Craig rode forward into  the end of his life so bravely that most of us never knew how bad his health was. He told us he was seeking treatment, but the end came quickly and, for him, stoically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was always a pleasure serving with Senator Thomas--first in the House of Representatives, then in the Senate, where we collaborated on a whole range of issues. The proximity of our home States and our shared interest and passion for natural resources and energy issues provided many opportunities to partner on legislative efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 2001 anthrax attack on the Hart Senate Office Building that pushed several Senators out of their offices, I was happy to offer Senator Thomas and his staff space in my office for several months until his office was deemed safe again. During that time I was able to get to know him and his staff even better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my condolences now to his staff. He was the type of man who was not just a boss but a friend as well. I know they are hurting. He will be remembered for being the quintessential Wyoming cowboy, a gentleman with quick wit and humility of spirit that endeared him to his colleagues and made him a joy to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any man who can list cowboy, United States marine, husband, and father on his life's accomplishments lived life well. The Senate has lost a gentle giant who served his State and Nation with honor and distinction. Joan and I are keeping Susan and the family in our thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I first note the presence on the floor of the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi. I note also present in the Senate is a beautiful bouquet of flowers on the desk that was occupied by the other Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say to Senator Enzi, first, we will all have an opportunity in the next few days and weeks to speak about the Senator who was your colleague who left us last night, and we all will have an opportunity to speak with you and see you on more occasions than this to express to you our heartfelt sorrow for the loss of your colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You will suffer a lot of things that will be downers during your life in the Senate--and because we all live our lives, things happen, go up and go down--but I am quite sure you will not have an opportunity to suffer any more severe a loss than the loss of your colleague who was at the same time a cowboy, a marine, a Senator, a father, and, clearly, a husband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had a wife named Susan. Everybody who knows her loves her. My wife loves her. I called my wife early this morning, after I heard, and I was so pleased she answered the phone herself because I thought: Where will I get her? We may get caught up in the maze of today and maybe I will not be able to talk to her until tomorrow, or maybe Nancy will not be able to talk to me. But, sure enough, it was at 8:30 this morning I was able to talk to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her first words, after knowing who I was, were words coming out of her mouth saying: He did a good job for Wyoming, didn't he? I said: You bet. Then: I am sure, not knowing the rest of his life, he must have done a good job in a lot of other areas. Probably he was a good husband--to which there was no answer because that was not intended as a question. He obviously was a wonderful man. Quiet, sort of unassuming, but he was a very involved Senator, especially when it came to Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very early on, as he worked his way from the House, where he replaced Dick Cheney, over to the Senate, where he had been elected, he decided he would work for his State. You did not hear of him a lot on national news because he was busy doing what he thought was best for him as a Senator, and that was, representing that great State of Wyoming. What a State that is, and what a Senator they had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my standpoint, I served with him on two committees. The one I know the most and remember the most is the one we served the longest on: Energy and Natural Resources, which the occupant of the chair has served on with us. But when it came to this man, he frequently worked with Democrats on serious issues because he wanted to get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is one thing I noticed as we worked together, shoulder to shoulder on this committee, it was that he was impatient because he did not understand when we wasted time and he did not understand why we were doing some certain things. He would ask: Why don't we get on with what we are supposed to do? What are we talking about this for? This is not policy. We are talking about a bunch of little things we ought not be involved in. I think I remember that more than anything else: Can't we get  on with it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember he was burdened with the fact there is a substance in his State called trona. The other Senator from Wyoming might know about it. He must know about it. Apparently, they were having competition in the world, and he thought the royalties were too high. I don't know. Anybody who served on the committee must have heard the word "trona" because he was all over that issue, wanting to get somebody to listen to him about the unfairness of it and to help solve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did not get to serve with him on the Finance Committee and other committees he served on, but it would be my guess he was the same way on all of them, that he showed up when he should and did his job as best he could, and that when the chips were down, you could count on him. When the chips were down, he did what he said. He voted the way he would tell you. He worked the way a dedicated person works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me and my wife, on this day, shortly after his death, I want to say in the Senate that Wyoming sent us a true man. I do not know whether it was the marines who made him a man or what it was, but he was truly different. He was tough minded. He was quiet. But he was impatient, and he wanted to get good things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am positive his relatives and his great State will never forget him. He will be remembered by them, just as we remember him. He will leave them, and they will have a big void, without a question, because a giant part of their lives leaves. That goes for Wyoming, and that goes for his wife Susan and their children. I think there are four of them. I did not get to meet them. But if they are like their mother and father, they could not help but be great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I say goodbye to the Senator, and I extend my sorrows to his wonderful wife, and, hopefully, I will be part of whatever ceremony there is for us to send him on his way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God bless his family and him, and may whatever he aspired to get done, get done by others who follow him because he set such a wonderful basis to get those things completed for his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senate and I thank the junior Senator from Wyoming for the kind man he is. I will be seeing him, and I say to the Senator, if I can help you during these times, please call on me. I am available.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the thoughts and prayers of my wife Charlene and myself are with Susan today and their four children, as we think about Craig Thomas, our dear friend, our colleague, a man who has been such a wonderful presence in our lives in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been said, and quite correctly so, about Senator Thomas as a cowboy, and certainly he was, and his rich heritage of experience in the Marine Corps, as he volunteered to serve his country after college. But I want to stress two or three things that perhaps have not come to the attention of Senators in the same way this morning, one of which is that Craig Thomas was a person who was vitally interested in the Far East. He served for a period of time on the Foreign Relations  Committee, and during that period of time, as I recall, was either the subcommittee chairman or heavily involved in hearings and in working with our Ambassadors to countries in Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a variety of reasons, because Craig always sought opportunities to serve Wyoming in whatever committee assignments seemed most appropriate at the time, his service on the Foreign Relations Committee was not a long one, but he continued that service by holding breakfasts in his office. I was privileged to be invited to those breakfasts in which famous people from abroad, especially the Far East, were his guests. These are ladies and gentlemen he had met during his foreign travels  or during his work in Wyoming in which they might have been of value to his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an extraordinary set of experiences. I stress "experiences" because there were many of these breakfasts. I encouraged him to continue on. I enjoyed the fellowship of the people he brought together as well as Senators he brought into an orbit of understanding about the Far East, through his own ministry in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been impressed in addition--speaking of breakfasts and the fact that Senator Thomas was a regular at the Aspen Institute breakfasts that are held right here in the Capitol on Wednesdays and Thursdays frequently throughout the legislative year. I am advised as many as 24 of these breakfasts are held on the subjects which the Aspen Institute Congressional group is focusing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the things on which the group has been focusing in recent years has been problems with Russia and the Balkans and developments in Eastern Europe, the problems certainly in education generally as a subject for our schoolchildren in this country, problems in Latin America, the problems of the environment and energy, and, appropriately, problems in Asia and especially China in the Far East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I noticed Craig Thomas, when it came to these breakfasts, usually was there on time and listened to the lecture or the paper that was being given by the speaker, and that he frequently proceeded on, perhaps, to another breakfast or another appointment without severely questioning either other Members of Congress or the speaker at the time, but was intensely interested. Because we frequently saw and listened to the same people, this led to many rich conversations which I was privileged  to have with him. I would ask him: What did you think? What were your impressions of that speaker today? He always had some very concise impressions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a third thing I simply want to mention, in addition to these breakfasts, is the sense of good humor with which those impressions were cast. He had his own unique sense of humor, and yet it was clearly there and very much a part of the personal association each one of us enjoyed with the Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, that sense of humor was shared by Susan, appropriately. I can remember so many times outside the door to this Chamber Susan would be standing there at about 6:30 at night or some such time. It was obvious she and the Senator were going to dinner or had some activity. But one of the delightful things was that so many of us had been visiting with Susan over the years. We had a lot to say to her and she to us, always with a wonderful sense of humor, with a sense of the work we are about,  how unusual to some this schedule seems, how absurd it may be to others,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>someone who had her own vocation as a very remarkable teacher and someone who understood the needs of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not surprising that Craig would attend the Aspen Education Conferences in addition to his far-flung interests in Asia and most importantly, obviously, the land use issues and the remarkable ability of people to make a living off the land in his home State. It was finally in that capacity that I enjoyed the best conversations with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig Thomas because he was deeply interested in agriculture, as I am. We come from very different kinds of agriculture, yet there was  a profound understanding of the challenges and the joys of people who make their living from the soil; likewise, from the husbandry of animals and the combination of forestry, and even the mineral uses of lands--much more abundant, I must say, in the State of Wyoming than in Indiana. But we both understood the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts are with the family today. We are never prepared for such a day. That is why many of us perhaps are rambling on occasion in our thoughts as we collect them about this outstanding Senator and wonderful friend. But it truly is a privilege to have this opportunity on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to my dear friend Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this is a sad day for all of us. Wyoming and the Senate have lost Craig Thomas. He was a neighbor. He was a friend. He was an individual whose life was committed to his country and his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often, when he would refer to my State of Nebraska, he would say: Oh, yes, that State of Nebraska; that is where Wyoming sends all of its wind. He said other things as well. Many times, he and Senator Enzi were responsible for stealing Nebraska's water. Other than those obvious flaws, Craig Thomas was one of those unique individuals whom we have heard his colleagues speak of this morning. None have exaggerated in their descriptions of this remarkable man. He, as has been noted,  was a marine. He was a straight shooter. He was born and raised on a ranch in Wyoming. When you add all of that up, what else could he be but a straight shooter?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He worked hard, as has been noted here this morning. Chairman Lugar outlined some of the participation of Craig Thomas on the Foreign Relations Committee where I, too, had an opportunity to serve with him. No one was ever better prepared when he spoke, more knowledgeable of the subject matter, and more a joy to be around because he never lost the most important element of each of us; that is, a humanness, the human dynamic. He had a special humanity that is not always easy to  retain in this town and in this business. But that is what Craig Thomas was, and I think that is what most of us admired most about him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If service to America is one of America's highest and most important values, then Craig Thomas's legacy speaks volumes because that was his life. Lilibet and I offer our sympathy and our prayers to Susan and to the family. He served with great distinction and always put others first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One last comment about a memory of Craig Thomas for me. In 1996, when I was campaigning for my first elective office to the U.S. Senate and when there was a very legitimate question of whether I was worthy of election and whether I could win, Craig Thomas flew over from Wyoming to central Nebraska and spent a day campaigning with me in 1996. Craig was the first U.S. Senator to help me, to come into my State, and that day I spent with him talking about water issues,  agricultural issues, the Marine Corps, and service to our country inspired all who were around him. I noted that those ranchers and those water resource specialists and others whom we visited on that campaign tour that day responded to him in a way that was rather special. I later learned through my almost 11 years in the Senate why people responded to him in such a special way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss him. He leaves our institution, his State, and his country better than he found them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, we will miss Craig Thomas. Craig Thomas would want it to be said that he was a conservative. He enjoyed expressing conservative views on this floor. He enjoyed expressing conservative views in our Energy Committee on which we served together, and the Senator from Louisiana and I served with Senator Thomas. He kept his feet firmly planted on the ground in Wyoming from which his conservatism came. He obviously well represented the people  of Wyoming because he barely noticed there was an election last year. When Craig Thomas ran, he was elected by an overwhelming margin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas was a conservationist. He was chairman of the National Parks  Subcommittee during the time I served on the Energy Committee, and he enjoyed that very much. I am not a bit surprised because he took great pride in the fact that Yellowstone, a great, premier park--I can say that even though we have the Great Smokies in Tennessee--but Yellowstone, which has such a special place in the hearts of all Americans, Craig Thomas took  special pride in his jurisdiction of that responsibility. He was honored by the National Parks Association a couple of years ago. Craig Thomas was awarded the singular honor of the National Parks Association for his stewardship of our national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas was no-nonsense. That came from several places, I suspect. One was, as the Senator from Nebraska noted, he was a marine. One was that he was a cowboy, a real cowboy. I saw Senator Inhofe talking about him in that respect. Another reason is he came from Wyoming. I see that Senator Enzi from Wyoming is here. Wyoming citizens, I have noticed, don't waste words. They think about them before they say them, and they often don't say them. They don't feel a need  to fill every vacuum with a string of words, which is an unusual characteristic on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but Craig Thomas was such a person. I think, in fact, he grew up in Wyoming, came from Wyoming, lived in Wyoming, kept his feet planted in Wyoming, and helped contribute to that no-nonsense approach to life he had which enriched the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas was also interested in working across party lines. Earlier this year, Senator Lieberman and I and others began a breakfast on Tuesday morning at 8 o'clock for those Senators who had time to come, not for the purpose of passing legislation but for the purpose of getting to know each other better across party lines so that we could perhaps come to solutions more quickly in other areas. It was interesting to see who came to that breakfast. We all are busy. We all have  tremendous demands on our time. We started off with 40 Senators of both parties. Sometimes it got to be 10 or 12 or 14. But almost every Tuesday morning at the bipartisan Senators' breakfast, Craig Thomas was there, and he always had a contribution to make. He was there 2 weeks ago, in the week before our recess, which is why it was such a surprise to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are a family here in the Senate. We say that often to one another, but it is true. We have breakfast together, as we did this morning at the bipartisan breakfast or as we will tomorrow morning at the Prayer Breakfast where we will remember Craig Thomas. We have lunch together, which we are about to do, Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. We have committee hearings and meetings all day long and little visits, and then in the evenings, if that weren't enough, why, we  get together and we go to receptions for each other. That is how we live our lives here. So it is a surprise to us to suddenly find ourselves without Craig Thomas, whom we saw at breakfast, whom we saw at lunch, whom we saw at committee meetings, and whom we saw in the evenings. We will miss him, but we greatly respect his presence here in the Senate for such a long period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he got sick last year, we heard that he was soon doing fingertip pushups again. So all of us thought--at least I thought--well, Craig is going to be fine. He is going to be fine. But, as will be the case with each of us, in the end, his life has come to a conclusion. It has been a life of public service, one I greatly respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Susan and to his family, Honey and I offer our sympathy and our respect for his life. We will be thinking and praying for them, and we will be remembering how much joy our friend Craig Thomas brought to the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam President.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about Craig Thomas. He was a friend of mine and of all of us in the Senate. His death is a shock to this institution and to all of us. I heard the news this morning on the radio, as many of us did, I believe, and I was genuinely shocked to hear that he had died. My last encounter with him was the week before we had our recess where I had the chance to be with him in the Energy Committee, and he was there and  very much participating in that committee hearing. He had a great deal to say, as he usually did, and an interest in what was going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the first thing that comes to my mind about Craig is that he was an example of courage in the face of adversity. I have seen several interviews recently where I was very admiring of Elizabeth Edwards and the tremendous example she is presenting for the entire country about carrying on in the face of adversity after having been diagnosed, as she has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the American people appreciate that, and understandably. I appreciate it, and I am sure everyone who is aware of her circumstance appreciates it greatly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same can be said about Craig Thomas. Craig was diagnosed with leukemia shortly before his reelection this last fall, and I think everybody had to know that this was not a minor illness that was easily overcome. Craig took it in stride. He was here working in the Senate. He went through the chemotherapy and he was back, regaining his strength, and all of us admired that. All of us admired the way he faced that adversity, and he did all that he could, all that was  humanly possible, to overcome that adversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the good fortune to serve with Craig on two committees, including the Energy Committee, where he was chair of the National Park Subcommittee. He took a great interest in issues affecting not only national parks but our public lands generally and, of course, our energy issues as well. I also had the good fortune to serve with him on the Finance Committee. The chairman of the Finance Committee this year appointed a new Subcommittee on Energy and Natural Resource Tax Issues. I was  fortunate to be named chair of that, and Craig was named as the ranking member. So he and I spent a lot of time together, both in the Energy Committee and in the Finance Committee, sitting in hearings and talking about the agenda of the committees and generally interacting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the other great good fortune of taking a trip last year that Senator Warner and Senator Levin sponsored--a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan, in April of 2006, with Craig Thomas. Craig and I were both invited to be on that trip. So I spent time with him and interacted with him in Afghanistan and in Turkey, where we made a short stop, and also in London, where we met with some British defense officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three things came through to me that I think are my recollection of Craig Thomas: First, his decency as a human being. When you are with a person for a substantial period of time, you get a sense of their decency as a human being. I have spent a lot of time with Craig Thomas in this Senate and on that trip to which I just alluded. I can vouch for his basic decency. He was always considerate, always civil, always concerned about the feelings of others and the reaction of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second characteristic I would allude to is his ability to ask tough questions. Craig liked to think of himself as a conservative. I would characterize him, as much as anything, as sort of a skeptic. Whenever the experts were telling us what the solution to a problem was, or what their analysis of a problem was, he was one who would stand back and say: Wait a minute, let's question some of that expert advice and expert analysis that you are giving us. That is very much needed by people  in public office. You need people who will ask the tough questions, and Craig Thomas asked the tough questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third is the characteristic that others have spoken of here--that he was a straight shooter; he was straightforward in his view of the issues. You didn't have to guess what Craig thought about an issue. He would tell you, and it was a heartfelt view that he was expressing. So this is a very great loss to this Senate, to the people of Wyoming, and to the country. I consider him to have been a superb public  servant. The people of Wyoming were  extremely well served by him, the country was well served by him, and this Senate was well served by having him as one of our distinguished members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my condolences to Susan and the family and, of course, to all of the people who are friends of his in his home State. He will be fondly remembered in this Senate.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise this morning with a very heavy heart, like all the rest of my colleagues, about the loss of our dear friend Craig Thomas. Craig was such an inspiration in such a quiet way to all of us, a guy from the true Wild West, the great State of Wyoming. He had such an easy manner about him that is so indicative of a lot of people who come from that part of the country. It was indeed a privilege and a pleasure to have the opportunity to serve with  him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a number of interests in common with Craig. First of all, we served on the Agriculture Committee together. In the past 2 years, as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Craig was one of those guys I called on from time to time to seek his advice and counsel because in the area of Wyoming and in the western part of the country, they grow different kinds of crops than what we grow in the Southeast. Craig was always willing to give his time to talk to me about the  thoughts of farmers and ranchers in his part of the country and what we needed to do from a policy perspective on the Agriculture Committee relative to his farmers and ranchers that would also be beneficial to my farmers and ranchers. I cannot overemphasize the value of that kind of relationship with a Member of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grew up in my law practice and in the rural electrification business. Craig was a strong advocate of rural electrification and the REA program and had been involved with it in Wyoming for decades. We had the opportunity to talk about this issue and long-term policy relative to providing electricity and other assets to people in rural America, and whether it was rural Wyoming or rural Georgia made no difference. Craig was an advocate of making sure that people in rural America  all across our great country had the opportunities that folks in the urban parts of America have. I had a special opportunity to work with Craig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier, I heard folks talk about Craig's love for the country and his love for the land. We were both outdoorsmen. He used to ride a horse a lot, and I like to shoot a shotgun at quail, pheasant, and a few other things that I have been blessed to be able to do over the years. We talked about our enjoyment of the outdoors on any number of different occasions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was the chairman of a major committee during the last Congress. He was in charge of an issue that has been very near and dear to my State, an issue of designating property with a heritage designation in Georgia. I worked on this for about 6 years. We got right up to the brink last year, and all of a sudden we ran into a roadblock. Craig, as chairman, said, "Saxby, here is the problem." Then he went through it and explained the very complex side of the issue that I had  never thought of before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What it made me realize about Craig was that he was a lover of the land of America, irrespective of whether it was in Wyoming, Georgia, or the State of New York. He wanted to make sure future generations had the same opportunity to enjoy lands as our generation and previous generations have had the opportunity to do. Once he explained his position to me, we again worked through the issue. It took us a little longer than I wanted it to, but I had to be patient because Craig was  very thoughtful. I knew his thinking was the right way of thinking on any issue like this, particularly with the designation of heritage areas, because there are other connotations to it than just saying we are going to leave this land for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was such a great ally in this process. At the end of the day, I remember when he gave his consent through a unanimous consent resolution. He and I sat right here near one another. He used to sit right there, and he moved behind me here. We sat across the aisle, and we had a long conversation that night about this particular piece of property for which he had now come to have a great appreciation. It is something that Georgians and America are going to enjoy for generations to come,  and it simply would not have happened without Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the desk that is right behind my desk is one of the more notable desks on this side of the aisle in this great institution because it is our candy drawer. His desk is our candy drawer. Of course, Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania had that desk in the two previous Congresses, and he kept it full of candy. Craig could not wait to get that desk when Rick left the Senate. Now, when a lot of us walk into the Senate door, the first thing we do is open that desk drawer to see what kind  of candy Craig has put in there for us. He has never failed us. It was always a delight of his to be able to make folks happy, and this was a simple and easy way to encourage and get a smile on the faces of Senators as we walked in the door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's wife Susan is such a great lady. I don't know his sons, but Susan is such a wonderful person. Again, as this body is such a small body, we all become friends regardless of our political differences. At the end of the day, we are a family, and we truly do have Susan and all of her other family in our thoughts and prayers as they go through what we know is a very difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig and I also had in common the fact that we were both cancer survivors. I went through a process about 3 years ago, and Craig was one of the first ones to come to me and give me his thoughts and encouragement, which I really respected and greatly appreciated. That is the kind of family thought process that we go through here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we reach this day when Craig has lost that last battle--and, boy, did he ever fight good ones through the years. He fought this one very well, too. But as we think about him today, knowing his love of the outdoors in our conversations about his riding horses--even riding horses with the Capitol Police on the grounds of the Capitol--I am always going to have those very fond memories of Craig Thomas as a great friend, a great Member of this institution, and a truly great  American. We know he is riding off into the sunset for a better life even as we speak today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had the great privilege of presiding this morning. I got to listen to my colleagues come to the floor to pay tribute to our friend, an outstanding Senator and a wonderful man, Craig Thomas from Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many things were said this morning, but I wanted to add a few more. First of all, as I sat in the chair to listen to the tributes, I want to give a compliment to the Senator from Wyoming, who spoke on behalf of his colleague. I have heard many tributes in the 10 years I have been in the Senate but, to me, it was one of the most beautiful tributes that a partner and colleague has made for another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Enzi will continue to carry on the great traditions of the State, and I am sure he, as we all have, will be inspired by his friend that we lost. It was evident in his heartfelt and beautifully executed remarks this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to rise as a Member who served with Senator Thomas on the Energy Committee, someone who worked fairly closely with him, although we are not of the same political party, to reiterate just a few things about his character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This life we choose to live in public life is not the easiest life to live, and sometimes it is harder on our families than it is on us individually. It is a life that we choose because we want to serve our constituents. We believe we can do that job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard so many of our colleagues rise to pay tribute to the Senator but  mention Susan, his wife, that I wanted to restate for the record how inspirational their relationship has been to me and to many of us. Not only did Susan wait for him, many times outside of this door, to greet him always with a smile or encouragement, they often were able to travel together as a couple, to share both the joys and the burdens of this life. I think it is a tribute  to both of them and particularly to Craig Thomas, who shared his life in such a special way with his spouse, which stands as an inspiration to us all, and Susan to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wanted to say what a strong and steady voice, an unflinching champion for Wyoming he was, in fact, even in the twilight of his life, within the last few weeks, as was mentioned by some of us who were with him at the Prayer Breakfast, some of us who were with him at the bipartisan conference, and some of us who were with him in one of his last Energy Committee meetings. I recall the memory of his voice, although weak in body, strong in spirit, fighting for Wyoming, talking about coal, talking  about a new energy policy, talking about how the country depended so much on the resources of Wyoming and how he was determined to continue to fight and provide that point of view on our committee. So on the Energy Committee we will miss him, always there, always on time, always steady, always strong, and never forgetting the State he came to represent and did so, so completely and so consistently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, some of us have mentioned the inspiration he has been to us in terms of his quiet and gentle spirit, knowing that he was facing a very difficult time, with his time perhaps not that long to be here. As many of our colleagues have said, however, he never complained. He always said how well he was feeling and how much better and how thankful he was for his doctors, for his family's support, and he was always thanking us for being there when we could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to mention the strength of his spirit in having come to terms and making peace in his life, that God was his friend. He had a great faith in God Almighty. It was evident by the way he walked, not agitated and not nervous, not anxious and not afraid, but basically the quiet confidence of a person who was at peace with God and with whatever God would have in store for him. I think those of us in the Senate family, for all we remember of him--as a cowboy, as a marine, as a Senator--we will  always remember the last few weeks of that quiet confidence of a man who knew why he was born and where he was going. That was our good friend Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Colorado.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my colleagues in tribute to the memory of a wonderful friend, Senator Craig Thomas from Wyoming. For me, Craig Thomas was not only a member of the Senate family, he was a neighbor to the north. Because of the similarities between Wyoming and Colorado in terms of the rural nature of our States, Senator Thomas and I had the opportunity to work on many matters during the time we both served in the Senate. I  wish to comment on two or three of those issues which were very important to us as we worked on them together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always saw Senator Craig Thomas as someone who was truly a fighter for the land, water, and people of this Nation, and the people of the State of Wyoming. I remember very clearly the debate we had in the Senate Energy Committee and the National Parks Subcommittee, which he chaired, about whether we were going to abandon the hundred-year principle that had guided the conservation philosophy of our national parks. It was Senator Craig Thomas who, at the point of the spear, made  sure that the conservation doctrine of our national parks' policy remained intact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also remember the leadership role Senator Thomas took in the last several years when there were efforts to try to sell off our public lands in order to make that part of the deficit reduction for our Nation. While he was a true fiscal conservative, he also understood the importance of the legacy of our public lands, protecting our public lands, and making sure those public lands were not used simply for deficit reduction. It was through his leadership that we were able to turn back  the efforts of those who wanted to sell off the public lands of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to also comment with respect to Senator Thomas's efforts for rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some significant differences between the Senate family and the House family. I think the House of Representatives, because of the makeup of that body--many of them come only from metropolitan and urban areas. Here in our Chamber, many of our Senators represent States that are very rural in nature, and there are very few States that are as rural as that great State of Wyoming. So it was natural for Senator Thomas to be a champion for rural America, and it was my honor to join  with him in working on a number of other things where we stood together and said that the America that had been forgotten by so many, rural America, was never going to be forgotten on the floor of the Senate. It was in that vein that Senator Thomas took a leadership role, along with our good friend, Senator Larry Craig</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was also in that regard that I had the honor of joining Senator Thomas last year and Senator Craig in moving forward with the creation of the Office of Rural Veterans Affairs. That is because Senator Thomas understood that there was a great disparity in how veterans were being treated in the urban-suburban areas of our society and those in rural communities. The fact is  that the VA had done a study that demonstrated the great disparity in health care services that were forthcoming from the VA to those veterans who lived in the urban communities as opposed to those who lived in rural communities. So it was his effort and his leadership that helped us lead to the creation of the Office of Rural Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, his work on the Agriculture Committee. When I think about Wyoming, a State that I often travel, a State where I have often worked, I think about its natural resources and I think about its people, but I also think about its agricultural base. Certainly, Senator Craig Thomas will always be remembered for his great advocacy for agriculture and making sure we have sustainable agriculture here in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senator Thomas for the contributions he made to my State, even though I am a very new Senator here in this body. We worked on a number of different issues. It was through his leadership that we were able to hold hearings and move forward on legislation that created the Sangre De Cristo National Heritage Area, the Clark County National Heritage Act legislation, the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act, and the Betty Dick Resident Protection Act, and I could  go on and on listing a whole host of other matters that were moved forward because of the advocacy of Senator Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I would say this: We get to know each other in a number of different ways here on the floor of the Senate and while working together. I fondly remember traveling with Senator Reid and with Senator Thomas to Iraq and spending 8 or 9 days with him in that troubled part of the world. I remember the conversations about his yearning for a more peaceful and stronger world, where we would create a legacy for our children that was a legacy of peace for the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was honored to often go to the Prayer Breakfast on Wednesday mornings and listen to the speakers. I knew Craig Thomas was a man of faith and that he was doing the duty of the people of this country and the duty of the people of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So from his neighbor to the south, I conclude by simply saying that I am proud of that cowboy. I am proud of Craig Thomas, and I am proud of the contributions he made not only to the State of Wyoming but the contributions he made to this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Wyoming.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I take that comment with respect and honor because I am here, like many of my colleagues, to join in speaking about the loss of Senator Craig Thomas, a friend from the neighboring State of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of years in working with Craig on the floor of the House and here in the Senate, I must tell you that notice of his death late yesterday evening was a real loss to me and my wife Suzanne. And I say to his wife Susan and their four children that we stand in quiet prayer for strength for you through this difficult time in the loss of a truly marvelous American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Colorado just mentioned the word "cowboy," and I oftentimes, when at a gathering with Craig, if the opportunity arose where we were both speakers and I was to introduce him--and that happened on several occasions--I would say: And now, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce the cowboy from Wyoming. And he would stand with a big smile on his face because he viewed that as a statement of respect. I think we westerners, who work closely together on issues that are uniquely  western, appreciate and understand that expression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig came to the House in 1989, just as I was leaving the House, so I got to know him then. And, of course, when he came to the Senate and came to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where we both grew in seniority, we began to work very closely together on so many issues that were important to the West but also issues that were important to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CQ, Congressional Quarterly, in its Political Profiles of American Politicians, said this about Craig, and I think it is so typical of the man. They said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Thomas pursues his State's interests, he does it in a quiet, methodical way that has made him remarkably few enemies after nearly two decades in Congress. Known for his courtesy and diplomacy, even on bitterly contested issues, he is no pushover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the Craig Thomas whom we all got to know. He could be tough in his position. He knew exactly where he was on almost all issues, and he very seldom gave ground. But he would give ground when he knew it would bring the issue to resolution. Now, I say that is the art of a talented policymaker, and Craig Thomas, representing his State of Wyoming and the Nation, was truly that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He filled big shoes. When he came to the House, he filled the shoes of the departing Dick Cheney, and, of course, when he came over here, he filled the shoes of Malcolm Wallop, who was well known here as a very clear conservative and often very partisan Member of the Senate. But in filling those shoes--and more importantly, he brought his own boots--he made his own mark for his State and for the Nation. So whether it was park issues, whether it was natural resource issues, whether it  was differences between that boundary line that sometimes is fairly indistinguishable out West between Idaho and Wyoming, Craig Thomas served the citizens of his State extremely well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes known as an open, multiple-use advocate, as both he and I are on the utilization of our public lands and their management, when it came to Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Teton National Park, they were something special in Craig's mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes I would say: Craig, you are siding with the environmentalists on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He would laugh or smile and say: Larry, nothing is too good in protecting Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Teton. They are the crown jewels in the Nation and they are a major part of my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we were very seldom in disagreement, there were times when there was a bump-up now and then, as is typical amongst all of us who serve in the Senate, even though on most issues we found great compatibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am one amongst all who will miss Craig Thomas. He was a friend of longstanding, a colleague. His wife Susan and my wife Suzanne had become good friends over the years, as so many of us do while working in the Senate. His life is taken from us and from the citizens of his State and from his family at a time when Craig Thomas was serving his State and his Nation well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, to his wife and children, we are going to miss Craig a great deal in the Senate. I, personally, as a friend, will miss Craig Thomas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I, too, rise today to pay tribute to our fallen friend, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig Thomas. My wife Tricia and I were greatly saddened this morning when we rose and found out that Craig had lost his battle with this form of leukemia. The four of us have been together many times, socially and in business settings. We have had some great experiences together in other parts of the world. We were so sad to learn he had passed away.  It was heightened by the fact that he seemed to have done so well after his first round of treatment. It was a great pleasure to come on the floor over the last couple months and see him looking better every day. He seemed to feel good. So I was personally excited that he was going to whip this thing. That was his attitude, as a true marine. He was fighting a battle to win.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He brought to the Senate a special down-to-Earth Wyoming wisdom, reflective of the unique part of the country he represented so well. Cody, WY, where he was born, is a special place. Craig was the epitome of the people in that part of our great country. In a legislative body of sometimes showboats, lightning rods and mavericks, Craig was an engine of the Senate. He was not flamboyant. He didn't try to be. He kept plodding along, trying to find a way to get the right results  and help the Senate do its job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have learned over the years there are some people in life, and some Members of the Senate, who are tried and true, who can be depended on no matter what the issue is. Craig Thomas was one of those. He kept the Senate on point when we strayed from the big picture--with his goodness, his common sense, and his affable manner. It is very easy to get fired up and lash out at an institution where we all come from so many different backgrounds and are so passionate sometimes about issues.  But Craig kept it cool, kept a level head, and kept moving forward. When we drifted off message, when we were too much into the weeds with our competing agendas, he didn't complain or rail or make demands to fix it, he rounded up several of his colleagues, came to the floor, and before long he had a way of helping us get back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His resilience and self-reliance were emblematic of the open range country in which he was born. He was Wyoming to me, in all its rugged zest for community, Nation, and faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was particularly interested in hearing our colleague, Senator Larry Craig, from Idaho, talk about his love of the outdoors, of Yellowstone, and his effort to preserve and improve that great national park. It was one of the things he truly did love. He didn't talk about himself very much, but he spoke eloquently about the quality-of-life issues of his mostly rural West neighbors. He was, after all, a farmer. That is what he got his degree in, in college--agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, he served his country for 4 years in the Marines. That was kind of how he approached his job in the Senate. He came to get things done, to get results for Wyoming, and the Nation. He was on the right committees to do that. He was on the Energy Committee, and I tangled with him, one time in particular I remember, on the Energy Committee. I came away knowing that, when you get in a tussle with Craig Thomas, you better bring your lunch because it will not be quick. It will take  a long time to work it out. But work it out we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also served on the Finance Committee, where I had the pleasure of serving with him. He provided, again, good, solid, calm counsel and participation. It was that self-reliance, that selflessness that diverted our attention from the tragedy his family was facing over recent months. But that is how he wanted it. He was riding the Senate range, keeping us on the trail, and helping us to stay with the big picture, to improve the quality of life of all those we represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tricia and I extend our love, our thoughts, and our prayers to Susan,  their children, and CRAIG's loyal staff. We have lost a solid statesman, and we will dedicate ourselves to keeping his spirit of goodness alive in the Senate for all of those to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, this is a sad time for the Senate. As we continue with the important business of the Nation, we pause for a few moments to think about our common loss of one of our kindest, most dedicated, and most thoughtful colleagues, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. All of us have our own private memories of our relationship with Craig. Mine is of him as a kind of silent leader, kind of an atypical character, if you will, in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I got here 4 1/2  years ago, someone alleged--and this is a broad characterization--someone said: Welcome to the Senate, a place that has 100 large egos and 200 sharp elbows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think what that person forgot to do was account for somebody such as Craig Thomas, who was never jockeying for the headlines and spotlight but always focused on his work and quietly, every day, made a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I learned firsthand in recent months, as I began working with a number of Senators on this side of the aisle, trying to encourage their active participation in the floor debates, Craig understood it is open debate and discussion in this, the world's greatest deliberative body, that protects and extends democracy. Indeed, every week as we met, Senator Thomas would simply ask: What can I do, JOHN? It is that fundamental desire to serve the public, the most basic and fundamental  question of all that best characterized Senator Craig Thomas: What can I do?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a defender of American values. From his service in the Marine Corps to his time in the House and the Senate, he served with courage and integrity. Nowhere was that more apparent than in the way he served and handled his final illness. You never would have known that he had been through chemotherapy or that he was not feeling well. The only way you would know is because his hair had fallen out as a result of the chemotherapy. It was almost back in its original form. But you never would  know from his attitude, which was always upbeat, always positive, never looking for sympathy but simply, day in and day out, doing his dead level best to represent the people of Wyoming in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was known as one of the people's most staunch advocates, leading the charge against Government waste and always fighting higher taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, Senator Thomas was an example to all of us. In an environment that can sometimes turn too nasty, his friendly demeanor and his dedication to his country was always a reminder that public service is more than a duty, it is a privilege. It can be conducted in a way that does not turn political adversaries into personal enemies. It can be done without bitterness, without anger, and with dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Craig was honored to be able to represent the State of Wyoming and that the State of Wyoming was privileged to be served by such a man. Wyoming and the Nation now mourn the loss of this great Senator, this great patriot, this fine husband and father, and this good man. He left an indelible mark on the Halls of the Senate and America in general. He will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Susan and all the Thomas family, Sandy and I say to you, you are in our thoughts and prayers, as I know you are in the thoughts and prayers of countless millions of people all across this great land. In these trying times, we are all comforted by the strong faith in God that Craig exemplified, as well as the enduring legacy he left and his positive impact upon the Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I listened to my colleague from Texas. I come to the floor to add a word about my friend whom we have lost, Senator Craig Thomas. Craig was from the State of Wyoming. He was from the northern Great Plains. Last evening, when I heard he had died, I spent a lot of time thinking about Craig and about this place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans see the partisanship. This is actually a political body, so it is not unusual there would be some partisanship. What most Americans never have the opportunity to see is the friendship. This is a small community of 100 Members of the Senate, men and women who come from every part of our country who are elected to serve. There is a great deal of friendship that exists in this Chamber, even in the middle of all of the politics that exists in our political system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig Thomas was an interesting and a wonderful man. I have had, especially the last 6 months, an opportunity to work very closely with him. I knew him as a Member of the House of Representatives. I knew him as a Member of the Senate and a colleague in both the House and the Senate. But the last 6 months we worked together, I as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and Craig Thomas as vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. We sat next to each other, hour  after hour, hearing after hearing, and I got to know a lot about Craig Thomas that I had not previously known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His word was his bond. He was quick with a smile. A quiet man in many ways, he cared deeply about his home State of Wyoming and cared deeply about the future of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was a proud son of the American West who never, ever forgot about the people he represented. His commitment to American Indians, and especially and particularly to those living on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, was evident as I worked side by side with him on the Indian Affairs Committee, as was his strong support for Indian health care and for all of the other services to Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to have the opportunity to work with him and to get to know him and to admire his work. In recent months, of course, Senator Thomas faced some very challenging health care issues with a very challenging illness. He met those challenges with courage and with grace. He never complained. I never heard him complain. In fact, it was just about 3 weeks ago at a hearing that I turned to him and said: You look great. You really look terrific. He said: I feel good. I feel great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a person with that kind of attitude. What a wonderful contribution to the Senate. I think all of us here will miss a terrific friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me end as I started by saying this is a political body. I know most Americans see the evidence of that politics, so they see sometimes the politics and the partisanship. What most Americans never have the opportunity to see is the friendship that exists on the floor of the Senate. Yes, even between those who from time to time are adversaries in debate but who understand each other and are friends with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of working with Senator Thomas for many years in the House and in the Senate, and particularly in the last 6 months as chairman and vice chairman of the committee. I will miss him dearly. I considered Senator Craig Thomas a friend. My thoughts and prayers today are with his wonderful family as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to our friend and colleague, Senator Craig Thomas. I always said if I got into a tough situation--using the allegory, a gunfight on Front Street in my hometown of Dodge City, KS--I would want Craig Thomas by my side. I also knew that he would be there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, it was only 2 weeks ago that he and Susan, his wife, corralled a group of supporters for me and we talked about his personal battle. He was confident. As Senator Dorgan has indicated, he looked good. And we joked with him of no longer being a member of the folliclely challenged caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His turn for the worse and sudden passing comes as a great shock to all of us. We served together in the House where, as in this body, he was always a voice of reason, a man of trust, decency, and commitment. Just this morning he was described by a fellow colleague as a "lovely man," a description that does not quite jibe with  Craig, a rough-hewn rancher with a gentle, quiet Wyoming demeanor, but it is a term that is true to the man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not know of anyone who did not like or respect Craig Thomas. In this day of rough and tumble public service and the Congress overflowing, it seems, in a cauldron of partisan discontent, Craig transcended all of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, the only thing any of us who have the privilege of public trust has going for us is our word. Craig Thomas set the gold standard in keeping his word and our trust and our admiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate, Wyoming, and our Nation have lost a steady hand and a man who did much for his special State. He was dependable in the finest sense of the word. He never sought the center ring or the spotlight; that was not his style. He was the epitome of a workhorse, not a show horse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember and I treasure our times together, especially when I first came to the Senate. We both agreed the length of a conversation does not tell anything about the size of the intellect. We also agreed that no matter who says what, you should not believe it if it does not make sense. Craig made sense. He did not need decorated words to make his meaning clear. He spoke Wyoming, and Kansas for that matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig would take the floor during morning business, and in his calm, reasonable manner then discuss an issue of the day. And you sort of had to sit on the edge of your seat and lean forward, and as they say in his beloved Marine Corps, listen up. He talked softly, he talked low, he talked slowly, and he said a whole lot without saying too much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To some of us in this body he was, and is, a fellow marine. In this case, Semper Fidelis, always faithful, is most appropriate. As I said, if anyone faced trouble in their life, the one person you would want by your side would be Craig Thomas. I shall miss him greatly as a personal friend, confidant, and supporter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of the offices I have occupied in the Senate were previously occupied by Craig. I just thought if they were good enough for Craig, I would fit right in. There is a short book by Bix Bender called, "A Cowboy's Guide to Life." In it, he describes the code of the West and urges men of this common background to write it in hearts, to stand by the code, and that it would stand by you. Ask no more and give no less than honesty, courage, loyalty, generosity, and fairness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, Craig Thomas embodied that code. Now, while our minds are full of sorrow and our hearts certainly heavy with his loss, Craig would not want that. In this regard, the words of Helen Steiner Rice come to mind as our thoughts and prayers are with his supporter, friend, and his wife Susan; his sons, Patrick and Greg; and his daughter Lexie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bless Craig Thomas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we did not think, coming back to the Chamber a week after we had all gone our separate ways back to our States, that we would come back with one of our Members not here. There is a drape over Craig Thomas's chair and a beautiful flower arrangement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But all of us who go through the day-to-day workings of the Senate, working with our constituents at home, the pressures which we all know we feel being 24/7 in a job that we love, but we all know the stresses and strains and therefore we bond because of the similarity of experience. So when we all said goodbye at the end of last week, we did not expect to come back and have one fewer Member. So I want to rise today to express my sadness for the passing of Senator Craig Thomas and to  express my deepest sympathy for his wife Susan, their family, and the people of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas served in Congress for 18 years, 6 years in the House and 12 years in the Senate. He had just been reelected to his third term. But his service to the United States did not begin when he came to the nation's capital. It began in the Marine Corps, where he served from 1955 to 1959. Then he went back to Wyoming to work at the Wyoming Farm Bureau and then the Rural Electric Association. Later, he began a career in public service, winning an election to the Wyoming House of  Representatives. Five years later he won a special election to succeed then-Congressman Dick Cheney as a Member of the U.S. House, and 5 years after that in 1994, then-Congressman Thomas won election to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas used his real-life, rural background to champion a positive agenda for America's rural community. As a former chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, Craig Thomas authored legislation to provide funding and management reforms to protect America's national parks in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was honored by the National Parks and Conservation Association with their William Penn Mott, Jr. Park Leadership Award. As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Thomas was instrumental in vital issues such as Social Security, trade, and tax reform. He was co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are impressive accomplishments, but Senator Craig Thomas, the man, was just as impressive. Every time I called Craig to fill in for me when I was vice chairman of the Republican Conference, he was there. He was on the executive committee as the vice chairman of the conference. Craig was the one I turned to the most to chair a meeting if I could not be there. He would talk on the Senate floor about the specific issues that we were wanting to focus on at the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was so well liked by everyone in this Chamber. I cannot imagine anyone ever saying they did not like Craig Thomas. His wife Susan is a very special lady as well. She works with children who have disabilities. She has made that her life-long mission. She is so loved and respected in the teaching community for the great work that she has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when all of us learned about Craig Thomas's illness late last year, we all thought: Gosh, he is going to be a fighter. He is going to do so well. And he did. He did do well. He fought it with immediate chemotherapy. He came back with less hair than he started with in the month of November, but we knew, as we were watching him progress, that he was looking better and better and his color was getting better and better. Then when we all left last week, some knew he was going back for  another round of chemo. Many of us did not know. But no one in our body realized how serious it was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, God did call him home. At the moment that he was called, his wife Susan; his sons, Patrick and Greg; and his daughter, Lexie, were all there with him. So our prayers shift now from recovery to comfort, and we hope his family knows and the people of Wyoming know what a mark he made on this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will be remembered, and he certainly is where the angels are because of his good nature and his good deeds. We wish Susan and the family our condolences and our best wishes, and we hope all of us will be able to have the good memories when time begins to heal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I join my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt condolences to Susan, the entire Thomas family, and the people of Wyoming over the passing of our dear friend Senator Craig Thomas. We have lost one of the truly great statesmen from this body who always had a kind word and a smile for me in the hallway or here in the well or in this body and anyone else he came across during the day. He had a wonderful way of calming people down and making people feel at  home. I personally felt a kinship with Senator Thomas. Our offices were not merely located in the same corner of the third floor of the  Dirksen building, we were neighbors in every sense of the word. We also had the distinction of serving together on both the Senate Finance and Energy committees. Not a day would go by that we didn't share a ride in the elevator or cross pathways in the hall or stand and visit with our staffs together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also both came from rural States with similar needs, and we worked together to address many of the same issues the citizens of Wyoming and Arkansas face. As one of the cochairs of the Senate rural health care caucus, Senator Thomas was a true leader and a fighter, consistently fighting to improve access to health care for rural communities, especially for seniors. We worked on several issues together to make sure our rural constituents had a voice on health care and many other important  issues. Senator Thomas and I also were delighted to work together to improve tax fairness for the numerous disabled veterans who served our country with dignity and honor and call Arkansas and Wyoming their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was a tireless advocate for Wyoming and fought to ensure that the interests of his State were always protected throughout the legislative process. I can't tell you how many times I saw different constituent groups from Wyoming lined up in the hallway to visit with their very respected Senator. He was always accessible and always made time for folks who traveled so far to see him. But he also made time to visit with those who were there in the hallway, oftentimes my constituents  or staff members. He was never in too big of a hurry that he couldn't stop and take the time to visit with someone, to share with them a kind word or listen to what was on their mind or in their busy schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has a tremendous staff. They all reflect the Senator's good nature. Working with his staff so closely in the neighborhood of the third floor of Dirksen, they exemplify the courage and kindness of this incredible Senator they have served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a tremendous public servant, and he served our Nation courageously as a United States marine. He was a true gentleman and one of the kindest and most genuine people you would ever meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am truly saddened by the loss of my friend, and my thoughts and prayers are with his dear wife Susan and the entire Thomas family. This Senate body, the State of Wyoming, and the American people have been truly blessed by his life and his service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I was deeply saddened to learn last night that Senator Thomas had lost his courageous battle against leukemia. Over the years, Craig and his wife Susan have become very good friends to both me and my wife Lucy. I will greatly miss him in this Chamber and, more than that, as a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas and I cochaired the rural health caucus. We have worked closely, along with our staffs, on rural health care issues. You couldn't find a more decent and honorable person than Craig Thomas. He is from Wyoming; I am from North Dakota. We didn't always agree politically, but we always got along. I always felt I had a friend in Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On health care, he and I partnered over several years to produce comprehensive legislation to improve reimbursement levels for health care providers in rural areas. During the legislation that passed on comprehensive drug legislation, there were provisions included to, for the first time in many years, improve reimbursement for rural providers. It is not well known in the country or perhaps even in this Chamber that rural institutions often get one-half as much to provide the same treatment as  more urban institutions. Senator Thomas and I focused on those issues in the Finance Committee. Much of the legislation that was included in the comprehensive drug legislation to for the first time address that unfairness in reimbursement was legislation Senator Thomas and I had offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spent hours and hours together agreeing on the elements of these legislative packages. Our staffs worked closely together. They became friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we were planning to introduce together the latest version of our comprehensive rural health care legislation. This week will be a poignant one for me and my staff as we consider what might have been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate Finance Committee, Craig and I worked closely together on other issues that are important to our States. We had a shared interest in the impact of trade on U.S. agriculture, whether it was unfairly subsidized foreign sugar or the Japanese and Koreans unfairly blocking exports of American beef. We also shared a deep interest on energy policy because Wyoming is an energy State, as is North Dakota. We worked together to boost transmission capacity and to support clean coal  technologies and to develop coal to liquid fuel technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you Craig Thomas was a determined and principled Member of this body. He had real convictions. They were never far from his heart. Craig Thomas was somebody who cared deeply about the people of Wyoming and the people of this country. He also was someone who could understand that others might have a different point of view. While Craig Thomas might not agree with you, he was willing to listen. He was always willing to debate, but to do it in a gentlemanly  way. I knew many times when Craig and I were debating legislation we were going to introduce, there were simply places he wasn't going to go. He was not going to go against certain deeply held principles. But he was willing to have a discussion about how we might accomplish the goal. That is something I admired deeply about Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a tenacious advocate for improving health care for the many rural communities in his State and across the country. He was a fierce fighter for the people of Wyoming. Nobody could ever doubt that. He brought that same strength and tenacity to his fight with leukemia. Although he must have been in pain in the last several weeks, he never let it show. In fact, one of the last conversations I had with him was right here in the corner of this Chamber. I asked him how he was doing. He was upbeat  and positive. I sensed he was on the mend. So it was a real shock to me to find out last night that we lost him. He continued to the very end to pursue his goals with courage and strength and as a true gentleman. We will miss Craig Thomas as a friend and a colleague. We will miss that wry sense of humor. We will miss his ability to find amusement in the daily workings of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all, we will miss his quiet smile and that twinkle in his eye, because all of us know that is the Craig Thomas who became our very good friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lucy and I express our deepest condolences to Susan and to his four children and to the larger Thomas family. We also take this moment to express our condolences to his very dedicated, loyal, and highly competent staff. Craig Thomas had around him people with the same qualities he demonstrated, people of quiet dignity and people of real competence who worked very hard for the people of Wyoming and this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer for allowing me to come over at this point in time. I shall take but a few minutes to address the Senate and the American public about the passing of a dearly beloved colleague with whom I and other Members of this great Senate have shared a friendship through the many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of us is deeply saddened at the passing yesterday evening of this valued friend and colleague. I first came to know him in 1995, when he took the seat of Malcolm Wallop. I had known Malcolm Wallop very well, still know him quite well. He was a very strong-minded, able, tough U.S. Senator, tough in the sense that he was a man of resolute convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We wondered who would take his place. Craig Thomas took Senator Wallop's place, and I think even Senator Wallop, were he here today to address the Senate, would agree he has followed in the footsteps of many great Senators who have come from the great State of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also served as a Marine officer from 1955 to 1959. He entered as a private and was released as a captain. I say, with a sense of humility, I entered the Marine Corps as a private and parted, many years later, as a captain. Therefore, we had a special bond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he was able, through the years, to carry on I think one of the great attributes of the Corps--taught to all of us--and where I failed, he succeeded. I used to have a nickname for him. I called him: Ramrod. He did not have to say "I was a marine" because you could tell by the way he walked, the way he carried himself, and the way he had his chin always projecting. That is the way we were taught in the Marines. It fell by the wayside with this humble Senator, but it never left the posture  of that great marine and great Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As marines served over the past 5 years on the tip of the spear around the world, all of our marines, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan of recent, it was helpful for the Senate to have Senator Thomas's perspective in looking out for our marines in a very special way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was very active in the Marine Caucus, meeting for breakfast at 0800 in the morning, getting together, talking about years past, years present, and years in the future. Each year, the Commandant of the Marine Corps would come over, and, quite understandably, the job fell to Senator Thomas, which he loved, to introduce the Commandant of the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I refer then to our Marine Corps Hymn, which all of us sing. And I quote one stanza:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our flags unfurl'd to every breeze,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From dawn to setting sun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sun has set on this great marine, and that is how I shall always remember him. Whatever the challenges facing us in the Senate, he was steadfast, unruffled, and committed to the task at hand, like the marine he was and always will be in our memories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting, another characteristic of marines--our good friend, Conrad Burns, being one, and to some extent myself--we tend to be rather gregarious, somewhat undisciplined and rough and ready. But Senator Thomas was a very quiet man, very introspective in his thinking, with a smile on his face. But he could project his persona without some of the other attributes we marines pride ourselves in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He chaired the Senate Rural Health Caucus. I am a member of that caucus, and I stop to think--I do not know how many are members of it--it was an effective caucus. We got together particularly on issues of medical care and how, through the past decades, that care has shrunk in the rural areas because of the lack of young men and young women going in and practicing medicine and accepting the hardships and indeed the less pay the rural areas have. But he left his hallmark trying to encourage better  medical care in those regions, which are in every State of our Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We both loved fishing. How many times we talked about trout fishing. He always said to me: John, I have a very special stream, almost untouched, largely unknown, but I will take you there someday, and you will experience a trip you will never forget. I have missed that trip.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His constituents, his loving family, and, above all, his wife Susan are in our thoughts and prayers. I ask colleagues to stop and think on those evenings when we got our evening engagements and we were, fortunately, going to be accompanied by our wives, that Susan would stand watch at the door of the Senate. I can see that spot. As you approach the Chamber, it is on the left, right there next to the column. I would always see her and wave a "hello."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to her and her family, thank you for sharing in our lives the richness of the life of your Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From one marine to another, I simply say: Fair Winds and Following Seas to you, sir. Semper Fi.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am deeply saddened at the passing of my dear friend, Wyoming's senior Member, Senator Craig Thomas. We have lost a truly dear and courageous Member of this body, whose absence will be felt. I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Thomas for many years, both in the U.S. House of Representatives and here in the Senate since his election in 1994. I found him to be a true statesman, of great character, with a passion for serving others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He grew up on a ranch in Cody, WY, and never forgot his roots, as he continuously advocated for rural communities and our natural resources. He graduated from the University of Wyoming with a degree in agriculture, and served our country proudly for 4 years in the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure in Congress, he forged a distinguished legislative record on issues as diverse as public land management, agriculture, fiscal responsibility and rural health care. It was a great pleasure and honor to serve with Senator Thomas on the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks, both when he was chairman and I was the ranking member, and most recently, when our roles were reversed this Congress. Working with Senator Thomas was a joy and privilege due to his positive  and optimistic attitude. We were able to accomplish many notable things during our tenure together, as we always worked in a bipartisan manner, putting the needs and challenges of the parks and public lands before all else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also had the privilege of working with Senator Thomas on the Indian Affairs Committee. As the ranking member of the committee, he took seriously his responsibility to address the needs of our country's indigenous people. Knowing of the challenges faced by our Native communities throughout the country, he worked tirelessly to improve their quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my heartfelt condolences and deepest aloha to Senator Thomas's wife Susan and their four children. They should be proud that he lived a full and purposeful life, and had a positive impact on the lives of so many. He will be sorely missed. Our prayers and support are with them as they walk down this difficult path.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, words cannot express how sad I am that my good friend Craig Thomas passed away last night. We will all truly miss his tenacious advocacy on issues, his incredible sense of humor, and his upstanding character and integrity. The Senate will not be the same without him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Craig for almost 20 years. I first became friends with him when we both served in the House of Representatives. We continued our friendship in the Senate, where I had the great fortune of serving with him on both the Senate Finance and Senate Energy Committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was a tireless advocate for Wyoming issues. He was an effective leader in energy, public lands, tax, trade, health, and rural community issues. We stood side by side on many issues, and I always felt we could accomplish any project because I had Craig by my side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He and I worked closely on energy issues in both committees. Craig was skilled at keeping his eyes on the details that mattered to the people back home in Wyoming. Recently, we worked together on a small issue in the landmark Energy Policy Act of 2005 that he helped craft. We learned that western coals, because of their naturally low sulfur content, would be excluded from certain clean coal programs for failing to remove the high percentage mandated by the bill. This was one of those  little things that slipped by many people but not Craig. We have already fixed the problem in the Tax Code and are now working to do the same in the Energy Committee. It was the little things he did for the people of Wyoming that made him such a great Senator for his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig also pushed to make sure that both his State and the Nation had an effective energy policy. Just a couple of weeks ago, Craig and I sponsored an amendment during markup of the Energy Committee biofuels bill to attempt to push coal-to-liquids technology into reality. THOMAS believed this would help both the people of Wyoming by providing more jobs and cheaper energy costs and would help the Nation by reducing our reliance on Middle East oil. And although this amendment  failed in committee, his dogged determination showed through  because he planned to continue fighting this issue on the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Susan and his children, Lexie, Greg, Patrick, and Peter. They have shown incredible courage and strength the past few months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have known Senator Thomas. He impacted all of our lives and will be sorely missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I appreciate this consideration. I realize we must move to the legislation before us, the issue of immigration, but I wanted to take just a few minutes this afternoon to stand in tribute to my friend, to our friend and colleague, Senator Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is fair to say that this is very difficult for all of us here in the Senate. It has been described that we are a family. We are friends. My neighbor Senator Thomas and I have sat on this back row together for this past year. I sit next to him in the Energy Committee. I sit next to him in the Indian Affairs Committee. He is a friend and a man whom I will miss very deeply. To learn this morning of his passing leaves me truly with a hole in my heart. I can't imagine the depth  of loss the family and his wife Susan are feeling at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recognize that we were privileged to serve with a truly incredible man. I haven't served with him as long as many of my Senate colleagues. I came to know him really from a very personal perspective. I was fascinated with the fact that he is a true cowboy. I have always kind of thought that cowboys never die. He was claimed by a very terrible disease, a very terrible cancer, leukemia. Alaska mourned the loss of a young woman just last year who was claimed by leukemia. She was a world-famous  dog musher. In Alaska, we say dog mushers, real famous dog mushers never die, either. So, again, my heart is very heavy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I got up this morning and saw on my BlackBerry the news of Senator Thomas, there was a second BlackBerry that came to me from one of the pages who served here in the Senate just last fall. She was one of the winter pages. I was very touched by the note she sent to the head of the page program, and she forwarded me a copy of it as well. I want to read just a paragraph from her e-mail to me because I think it reflects how Senator Thomas touched the lives of so many--not just  his colleagues and not just the people of Wyoming but a young 16-year-old page from Alaska. She wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My class and I witnessed some of the stages of Senator Thomas' sickness, but we never witnessed him getting upset or angry because he was feeling down and overtired due to his symptoms and treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was a cheerful man, always smiling and personable, even when he was not being approached. He did not have to address us at all; we were pages, mere peons in the infrastructure of what we know as the Senate. Yet, every time he entered the Senate, he warmed the room with his smile and a warm glow that protruded gently from his kind eyes. When he would speak to us, he did so with the utmost respect and thoughtfulness, truly treating us as equals. He never looked down on us, and I  believe that is why his memory has stayed with me and will continue to do so in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What made Senator Thomas remarkable, aside from all this, was that at the end of the day when we were at our lowest point and we felt so tired we couldn't help but frown, he was the one that no one ever caught frowning. He was a great Senator, and from what I have had the chance to witness firsthand, a great man. I am deeply sorry for this loss, and I hope that this e-mail will attest to that. His actions and his kindness were not lost on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was signed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With utmost respect and deepest sincerity, Former U.S. Senate Page, Lily George</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Anchorage, AK.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought it important to share that e-mail with my colleagues because, again, Senator Thomas was one who generated warmth with everybody he reached out to, whether they were pages or Senators or people in the airport. We will miss him very deeply here in the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, today we pay tribute to Senator Craig Thomas, whom we unfortunately lost to cancer last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts, prayers, and sympathy go out to his wife Susan and their children during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity to work closely with Senator Thomas on the Environment and Public Works Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a leader in the energy, agriculture, water resources and agricultural issues that affected his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I highly respected his low-key, behind-the-scenes manner of getting things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was forward looking: he believed that "clean technologies" were a solution both to environmental pollution and to our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Finance Committee, he was a dependable vote for fiscal sanity, tax simplification and cutting spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is said around here that there are "work horses" and "show horses." By that measure Senator Thomas was certainly a work horse. He did not aggressively seek the limelight. Instead he worked quietly and diligently, with integrity, to get things done for Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss his knowledge, competence, and his friendship.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am deeply saddened by the death of my friend, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas was a popular figure in his hoe State of Wyoming, winning a third term last November with 70 percent of the vote. He was known both at home and in Washington as honest, hard-working, decent, and effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came to the Senate in 1989 through a special election to fill the vacancy left by DICK CHENEY, who had been named Secretary of Defense. He won that race with 52 percent of the vote. By the year 2000, Senator Thomas's popularity had soared, and he won reelection with 74 percent of the vote--one of the largest margins of victory in Wyoming history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas's record of public service reaches back well before his tenure in the U.S. Senate. Prior to his election to the Senate, he served 5 years in the Wyoming Legislature, and four years in the U.S. Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His positions on the Finance Committee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Environment and Public Works Committee allowed him to be an advocate for issues such as conservation and fiscal conservatism. He was a champion of issues of concern to rural America such as affordability and access to quality health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas's home State of Wyoming is not unlike my State of Mississippi, and we often worked side-by-side on issues that face our States. He fought to improve the quality of life for the people of Wyoming and was a strong advocate for the agricultural sector of our economy. He was tireless in urging the importance of public land management and conservation of our natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas will truly be missed in the U.S. Senate. He reflected great credit on this body. It is my hope that the spirit of fairness and decency he represented will continue to be mighty valued in the Senate as a mark of our continued appreciation of him and his exemplary service to our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear colleague and a tireless advocate for the people of Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Muhammad Ali once said, "Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth." Senator Thomas paid his rent in full.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No truer to his State could a man be than CRAIG THOMAS was. Born and raised on a ranch outside of Cody, WY, he grew up in the Wyoming public school system, attended the University of Wyoming, served as president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau, general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association. He served in both the House and Senate and returned to his State every weekend, visiting hometowns and parks, never losing sight of his constituents and their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitment to this country led him to serve with great distinction in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959. Before being elected to the U.S. Congress, he held office for 5 years in the Wyoming State Legislature, where he got his start in politics. And throughout his distinguished political career, Craig Thomas became known for his leadership on issues so critical to the well-being of Wyoming, issues like rural health care access, fiscal responsibility, and the protection of our  Nation's park lands. As cochair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, he urged Congress to continue its support for rural health programs like the Community Health Centers Program, which provides services to over 16 million  people living in underserved areas. This is only one of the many legacies he leaves behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sorry I could have not served longer with Senator Thomas. My memories of him are as a kind, quiet, and humble man. He commanded enormous respect from us all, and had a clarity of vision that did not go unnoticed. In the face of a life-threatening illness, he returned to work this year with the conviction of a cowboy who knows that if you get thrown from a horse, you have to get up and get back on. His courage throughout this tremendous battle will continue to inspire those of us  who follow him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this sad occasion of his passing, Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to the members of his family, especially his wife Susan and his four children, to his staff, and to the people of Wyoming. I join my colleagues and fellow Americans who are praying for them and mourning their loss during this time of grief.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President. I rise to honor the memory of Senator Craig Thomas, who passed away last night, Monday, June 4, at National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew Senator Thomas--as we all did--as a quiet gentleman, and a dedicated advocate for the people of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heart goes out to his wife Susan and to their four children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas died of acute myeloid leukemia, which he had been fighting for several months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us are familiar with Senator Thomas' courage, because we saw it here, in the Capitol, and on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came here to do his duty, even though he was fighting a disease that would ultimately take his life. That is the mark of true courage--not at all surprising, coming from this son of the American West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was raised on a ranch near Cody, WY. He attended public schools, and graduated from the University of Wyoming at Laramie, earning a degree in agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After college, he served 4 years in the Marine Corps. Then he went on to become vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau, and general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served 5 years in the Wyoming State Legislature. In 1989, he was elected to the House of Representatives in a special election to replace Dick Cheney, who had been named Secretary of Defense. He was elected to his first term in the Senate in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was reelected to his third term last year, with 70 percent of the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here, Senator Thomas was a strong voice for the people of his home State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This included working to improve health care opportunities for rural families, work he pursued as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, and as cochair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas served as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, and his work was recognized many times by the National Parks Conservation Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The organization honored him with its William Penn Mott Jr. Leadership Award, and with the National Parks Achievement Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the distinct pleasure of working with Senator Thomas on some issues close to my heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, he was part of a bipartisan coalition that joined with me, and with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to extend the sale of the breast cancer research stamp, which has raised $54.9 million for breast cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Senator Thomas joined with me to cosponsor legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to His Holiness, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, in recognition of his message of compassion and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Senator Thomas and I collaborated on a plan to use Wyoming Powder River Coal to produce cleaner electricity, which would be sold to Western States, including California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas served Wyoming and the Nation well. He will be greatly missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute and bid farewell to my colleague and friend, my neighbor from the great State of Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig brought a quiet dignity to this august Chamber. He was a Senator with the heart of a cowboy. We all knew that he would rather have been on horseback in the Wyoming prairie than in Washington, DC, but this was where the people of Wyoming needed him to be. Indeed, all citizens of America benefitted greatly from his presence in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was the champion of rural America. He quietly but tirelessly fought for the hard-working people of rural America, the people who provide us with food and energy, the wool-growers, the cattlemen, and the farmers. If ever there were a question on agriculture, Craig was the man to see. During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, we all relied heavily on Senator Thomas's expertise and leadership on agriculture, rural development, and many other important topics debated  by this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We served together on the Senate Finance Committee where he would often entertain us with his stories and experiences. I truly enjoyed listening to him and hearing about his great State of Wyoming. Craig had a way of dealing with the complex issues facing the Finance Committee that was very direct and meaningful. He had a way of distilling the complex tax, trade, and health care issues down to their core and ensuring that real people, with real concerns were addressed by the policies  created in the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the distinct privilege of sitting next to Craig in committee meetings, in briefings, in lunches, on the floor, and in several other settings, and I can tell you he was always a gentlemen. He was always a caring legislator, and he was always a true and loyal friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig earned great stature and prestige in the time he spent as a leader in the U.S. Marine Corps, the Wyoming Farm Bureau, the Wyoming State Legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. I am honored to have served beside him for so many years in the Senate, and I will miss my friend dearly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleagues in offering my condolences to Senator Thomas's family, especially his widow, Susan. My thoughts and prayers are with them on this day as we mourn the loss of a great Senator but celebrate the life of our great and dear man. The people of Wyoming will certainly thank Susan and the rest of the Thomas family for sharing their beloved Craig with them, and I believe the entire Nation would join with me in thanking Susan for sharing her great husband  with us. He represented the good people of Wyoming in such a capable and dignified manner, and I know they are going to miss him. In fact, the entire Nation is going to miss him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this instance, I believe it is appropriate to quote the beloved cowboy song and say to Craig, "Happy trails to you, till we meet again."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I was deeply saddened to hear of the sudden passing of my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Craig Thomas. The loss we all feel at his passing is tempered by the happy memories I have of working with him on so many issues of mutual interest. His efforts and his leadership on the panels on which we served together the Senate Finance Committee, Senate Agriculture Committee, and Senate Environment and Public Works Committee--will remain foremost in my memory. I  particularly admired his staunch advocacy for the needs of rural communities and farmers. Craig brought a special passion and expertise to issues affecting ranching families. His focus on their unique needs spanned the trade, economic, environmental, and public lands management issues of rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig brought to Congress his vision for the needs of Wyoming and rural States, and he became a strong advocate of effective resource and energy policies. I am pleased to have partnered with him in applying technologies to improving our Nation's energy generation. Although he lived his life modestly, he became a leader in national park stewardship, and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude for his promotion of the underserved National Park System. I also appreciated his long  and thoughtful counsel on ways to update the Endangered Species Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent months, Craig took a prime role on the Finance Committee in working to simplify the Federal Tax  Code and improve entitlement and health care assistance to the least fortunate. As one who took to heart the importance of protecting the taxpayers' dollars, Craig was a strong proponent of restoring the sustainability of our Nation's welfare system. And Craig understood that economic development in rural States like Wyoming  was inextricably linked to trade promotion that ensured open and fair markets abroad. I will miss his stalwart and consistent advocacy for farming communities as the Senate considered trade legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a man who represented a small State in population, Craig towered large over the landscape of thoughtful conservative Members of Congress. I think a fitting tribute and legacy to our late friend would be to adopt his resolution making July 28 National Day of the Cowboy. My thoughts and prayers are with Craig's family and friends. I will miss my good friend and colleague.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, last night, the State of Wyoming lost a fine statesman and a true gentleman with the passing of Senator Craig Thomas. Senator Thomas was a strong advocate for his State and its interests. He fought hard for his priorities, and I especially admired his tireless advocacy for our Nation's beautiful parks and wilderness. He also worked hard for the priorities of rural Wyoming and indeed all of rural America, fighting hard to improve health care infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas dedicated his life to serving his country and his State. After graduating from the University of Wyoming, he joined the Marines and began his long career of service. Even when faced with his final battle with cancer, he continued to fight on for Wyoming and serve with distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Senate lost not only an outstanding advocate but a wonderful person. More than anything, I will remember Senator Thomas as a man who carried himself with dignity and who treated all of his colleagues with respect, despite party differences. More than any debate, committee hearing or piece of legislation, it is his warm smile that I will remember most. I know he did a fantastic job representing the State of Wyoming, and I am honored to have known and worked with him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with deep sorrow--deep sorrow--that I note the passing of our colleague Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. He was my friend. He always passed here and I would say: How are you doing today, Cowboy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First elected to the Senate in 1994, Senator Thomas was twice reelected to the Senate by some of the widest margins in his State's history, one time reaching 75 percent of the vote. It is hard to beat that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has already been mentioned today, he was one of the very few people from Wyoming to have represented his State in both houses of the Congress, over there and over here. Here in the Senate, I found him to be a most considerate and patient colleague. He was always willing to step aside for another Senator who sought recognition. He was a nice man, a very quiet man with a radiant smile, staying out of the spotlight, working behind the scenes, always ready to cooperate and work with others for  the good of our country. He was a good, decent human being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we represented different political parties. Yes, we sometimes held different political views, and we came from vastly different parts of the country, but we shared important common interests and objectives. With his State of Wyoming being the No. 1 coal-producing State in the Nation and my State of West Virginia being No. 2, I always appreciated his support for clean coal technologies and legislation that promoted the use of coal. I always appreciated his interest in and support of our country's  beautiful and magnificent national parks. As chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, he sponsored legislation that both protected and promoted these national treasures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as this former marine dedicated his life to his country, he dedicated his career in the Senate to improving the quality of life for rural America. As cochairman of the Senate rural health caucus, he worked tirelessly to improve the quality of rural health care. He was truly a fine Member of this institution and a great American who will be missed by his colleagues, certainly by me, and by the people of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I express my sincere condolences to his wife Susan, to his sons and other members of his family, to his staff, and to the people of Wyoming. All of us will miss Senator Thomas. But we will always retain our very fond memories of him, Craig Thomas. Bless his soul. May God bless him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat these few verses in his memory:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Goodbye, Craig. I will miss you. But we will meet again on that far shore where the roses never wither and the flowers never fade.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am going to have a statement printed in the Record, but I did wish to say something this evening before the evening is over about our colleague, CRAIG THOMAS. CRAIG was a wonderful friend of all of us. In my case, being a fellow Westerner, I had a special affinity for CRAIG. He was a fellow I could talk to--without talk. Particularly a cowboy such as CRAIG can communicate with you in a real Western way that doesn't require a whole  lot of "jibber-jabber," as he would say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CRAIG was a man of the earth. He really was a cowboy, and a good one at that. He took that kind of set of Western values, of not talking a whole lot but meaning what he says and saying what he means, into the political life. When he came to the Senate, I think everyone appreciated that quality in him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, I would say he reminds me of my colleague, the Senator from Alabama, in that regard. You never have any doubt about where the Senator from Alabama stands and you never had any doubt about where Senator Craig Thomas stood. That is a quality we need in our public officials today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CRAIG's wife Susan is a wonderful friend of mine and of my wife Carol. Our hearts go out to her and their family tonight. But she does have, at least, I think, the solace in knowing that people all over this country--not just from their home State of Wyoming--have tremendous respect for the achievements of her husband CRAIG and the way in which he handled himself as a Member of the Senate, never letting an ego take over what he understood to be his primary responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was quiet and he was humble. He was serious and he was very hard working. He stood up for the interests of the people of his State. He was a great patriot for the United States of America. But he never took himself so seriously that he gave even a hint of pomposity or being someone who didn't understand where he was grounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss CRAIG THOMAS immensely. We will never forget him as a loyal friend, a patriot, and someone who was quintessential in the way he represented his area of the United States and, in particular, his constituents in the State of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Alabama.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank Senator Kyl for his good remarks. I thought perhaps tomorrow I would have the ability to focus on our  loss, but I will attempt tonight to say a few words about our colleague, CRAIG THOMAS. I loved CRAIG THOMAS. He was a person who came from the West. He understood where he came from. He understood the values with which he was raised, and he reflected those daily in his work in the Senate without  ever bragging about it or talking about it. People just knew it. He was a man of character and integrity, a man who, as Senator Kyl indicated, never allowed personal ego to interfere with his commitment to serve his constituents and his Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a visit to Iraq together not too long ago. Things had not been going well. He would ask penetrating questions. He would ask: When are the Iraqis stepping up and how much are they doing so? How long do we continue to put our troops at risk if they are not carrying their load?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did it in a way that was sincere and raised fundamental questions of great importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CRAIG liked issues. He believed in a series of principles that made America great. He cared about those principles. For a time, he volunteered to come to the floor and be a part of a message team for the Republican Senate Members and spent a good bit of time at it--over a year or two. During that time he would articulate the basic premises and values that I think are foundational for the Republican Party and for most Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to our wonderful friend Susan, our prayers and our sympathies are with you. We can only imagine the loss you have sustained. We have watched in these past months the courage that CRAIG had displayed as he suffered from the terrible disease that he had. We saw the strength that he had, his refusal to stay at home but his determination to be at work. I had several examples of it in which I talked to him, and I said it is not necessary for you, you need to rest up. He knew he  was susceptible to infection. But he was determined to fulfill his responsibilities as a Senator and he did so in a way that all could be proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He ran the race and he fought the fight. He served his country with great skill and ability. Our respect and love is extended to the family and our prayers are with him and the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am aware of the hour of the recess, and I will be very brief. But I wished to come and express my condolences to the family of Senator Thomas and to share for them, spread upon the pages of the Congressional Record, the fact that a faithful member of the weekly Senators Prayer Breakfast was Senator Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gathering is private, Senators only. All Senators check their egos and check their partisanship at the door and join together as friends in a spiritual setting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a delight it was for this Senator to share that collegiality with Senator Thomas on a weekly basis in the proceedings of the Senate. For that friendship, that collegiality, I am especially grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
