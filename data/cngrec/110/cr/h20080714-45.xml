  <narrative>HONORING THE MEMORY OF WARREN G. DAVIS -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6450]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise on this occasion to first of all say how much I appreciate this opportunity to address my colleagues and the Nation and to talk for just a few moments on a good and decent person, a great American. His name is Warren G. Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren G. Davis passed away a few days ago. He was more than just an ordinary person. God blesses us with many blessings. But there is no greater blessing that he blesses you with than that to have a friend, a friend for life. And that is what Warren G. Davis meant to me and our friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren G. Davis comes out of Texas. He was born out of Refugio, Texas, near Victoria and near Corpus Christi, a man of God from the very beginning. Warren Davis was a loving husband to his wife of over 38 years, Linda. He was a loving father to his two sons, Brad and Warren Junior. He was a loving brother to Fred Davis and his cousin Harold Martin. And of course his mother, his father and his entire beloved family mourns this hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that not only his family mourns, his immediate family, for this young man touched many lives. In his community of South Lake, Texas, he played such an important role as a community leader, for Warren not only gave to his family, but he gave to his extended family and his entire community. He served on the school board of South Lake from 1993 to 1996. He was a member of the Red Creek Community Association. As a matter of fact, he served as its president. He was  also a member of the very elite community group called the Dragons Council. It was no ordinary group, for this is an elite fan-based booster group for the young people in that community and supported the South Lake teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show you a measure of his commitment, over the many years Warren G. Davis never missed a single game. He gave so much of his life to this community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren Davis and I go back from the very beginning of our college careers. He has been a friend for over 45 years to me, Mr. Speaker, for in 1963 we both went to Florida A&amp;M University where this young man was also my college roommate for 4 years. We pledged fraternity together, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity; oh, did he love Alpha Phi Alpha, and we pledged the Beta Nu Chapter. We affectionately referred to ourselves as the 12 disciples. But Warren Davis was the enforcer of our group. He was  the glue that kept us together. He learned very early to work with different people. He not only was there as a fraternity person, but also worked early in the student movement when we had the task of integrating many of the public facilities in Tallahassee, Florida, as we matriculated through Florida A&amp;M University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he left Florida A&amp;M, he started a very distinguished career in the computer field as one of the foremost African-American executives with the IBM corporation, working as an executive in the management and the market and the accounting areas, and paving the way for other African Americans to be able to follow in his footsteps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a great American and one who was humble and humbled himself before God and understood not only who he was but whose he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I just want to rise this afternoon to say these few words about my  great friend, my good friend, Warren Davis. Let me just say in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that Warren Davis fought the good fight. Warren Davis finished his course, and Warren Davis kept the faith. And henceforth there is put up for him a crown of righteousness which the Lord, that righteous judge, has made available to Warren G. Davis, and so many people both near and far all across  the breadth and the scope of America collectively say we thank God for sending Warren G. Davis our way.</paragraph>
