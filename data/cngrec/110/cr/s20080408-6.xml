  <narrative>IRAQ HEARINGS -- (Senate - April 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2709">S2709</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as we speak, there are extremely important hearings taking place on Capitol Hill. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are here. The hearings started 35 minutes ago. Clearly, the eyes of the world will look upon the Senate as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testify today before the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. These two committees are chaired by two of our most senior Senators and two of our most able Senators, Senator Levin  and Senator Biden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The appearances of these good and honorable men, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, are meant to create an open, honest, and productive dialogue with Congress on the state of the war in Iraq and the future of military operations in Iraq. I hope it does occur in that manner, that there will be an open and honest and productive dialogue with us. As the American people weigh the testimony and consider the best course of action in far-off Iraq, only two questions matter: First, has the troop  surge brought us closer to the day when our troops can come home? Second, is the war in Iraq making America safer? Sadly, by all accounts, the answer to both questions is no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stated purpose of the surge, according to President Bush, was "return on success," meaning that if the surge worked, the troops could come home. Now, the President claims success, but where is the return? It is clear to anyone that the violence has surged. Eleven Americans have been killed since Sunday in Iraq. Dozens and dozens more have been gravely wounded, including three dozen in one rocket attack. Attacks on the Green Zone have intensified. That is supposed to be the safest part of  Iraq--the Green Zone. The conflict between al-Sadr and al-Maliki shows no signs of progress; in fact, there is deterioration. Has the surge brought us closer to the day when our troops come home? We have already heard General Petraeus has requested a freeze of troop levels and that President Bush is likely to accept that request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has the surge brought us closer to the day when our troops come home? Clearly, the answer is no. Has the war made us safer? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military experts agree our Armed Forces are stretched thin beyond sustainable levels. We are taking in--13 percent of our recruits are young men and women who have committed crimes: felonies, violent crime--13 percent. One out of every eight of the people we are bringing into the military  today are people who have criminal records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because our manpower and equipment is in Iraq, we are not committing the resources to hunt down our No. 1 enemy: bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. Because we are bogged down in Iraq, we are not fully engaged in the global challenge of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and the Middle East, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The moral authority of our great Nation has suffered grave damage, with our former allies refusing to stand with us in even greater numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has the war in Iraq made America safer? There is no question it has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The surge may have provided a temporary window for the Iraq Government to make progress, but it is becoming increasingly clear every day the Iraq Government has squandered that opportunity. Even now, with the war in its sixth year, President Bush has failed to articulate an exit strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A person running for President, Senator McCain, has said we should be there another 50 or 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush likes to say we will only leave Iraq once victory has been achieved. It is time for the President to be honest with the American people. What does victory look like to President Bush? How does all this end?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not commit our courageous troops to the endless task of policing another Nation's bloody civil war. The job of America's Armed Forces--a job to which they risk and often give their lives and limbs--is to protect our country and its interests. It is time to recommit to that crucial purpose and begin a responsible end to this war.</paragraph>
