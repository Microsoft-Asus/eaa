(A) reduce energy, water, and material resource use and the generation of waste;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) improve indoor environmental quality, and protect indoor air quality by, for example, using materials that emit fewer or no toxic chemicals into the indoor air;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) improve thermal comfort;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) improve lighting and the acoustic environment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) improve the health and productivity of individuals who live and work in the buildings;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) improve indoor and outdoor impacts of the buildings on human health and the environment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) increase the use of environmentally preferable products, including biobased, recycled, and nontoxic products with lower lifecycle impacts; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) increase opportunities for reuse of materials and for recycling;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) during the planning, design, and construction of a high-performance green building, the environmental and energy impacts of building location and site design, the minimization of energy and materials use, and the environmental impacts of the building are considered;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) according to the United States Green Building Council, certified green buildings, as compared to conventional buildings--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) use an average of 36 percent less total energy (and in some cases up to 50 to 70 percent less total energy);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) use 30 percent less water; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) reduce waste costs, often by 50 to 90 percent;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the benefits of high-performance green buildings are important, because in the United States, buildings are responsible for approximately--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) 39 percent of primary energy use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) 12 percent of potable water use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) 136,000,000 tons of building-related construction and demolition debris;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) a July 2006 study completed for the General Services Administration, entitled "Sustainable Building Rating Systems Summary," concluded that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) green building standards are an important means to encourage better practices;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard for green building certification is "currently the dominant system in the United States market and is being adapted to multiple markets worldwide"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) there are other useful green building certification or rating programs in various stages of development and adoption, including the Green Globes program and other rating systems.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to encourage the Federal Government to act as an example for State and local governments, the private sector, and individuals by building high-performance green buildings that reduce energy use and environmental impacts;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to establish an Office within the General Services Administration, and a Green Building Advisory Committee, to advance the goals of conducting research and development and public outreach, and to move the Federal Government toward construction of high-performance green buildings;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to encourage States, local governments, and school systems to site, build, renovate, and operate high-performance green schools through the adoption of voluntary guidelines for those schools, the dissemination of grants, and the adoption of environmental health plans and programs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) to strengthen Federal leadership on high-performance green buildings through the adoption of incentives for high-performance green buildings, and improved green procurement by Federal agencies; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) to demonstrate that high-performance green buildings can and do provide significant benefits, in order to encourage wider adoption of green building practices, through the adoption of demonstration projects.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 423.

DEFINITIONS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In this title:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) MAJOR ENERGY PRODUCER.--The term "major energy producer" means a country that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) had crude oil, oil sands, or natural gas to liquids production of 1,000,000 barrels per day or greater average in the previous year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) has crude oil, shale oil, or oil sands reserves of 6,000,000,000 barrels or greater, as recognized by the Department of Energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) had natural gas production of 30,000,000,000 cubic meters or greater in the previous year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) has natural gas reserves of 1,250,000,000,000 cubic meters or greater, as recognized by the Department of Energy; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) is a direct supplier of natural gas or liquefied natural gas to the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) MAJOR ENERGY CONSUMER.--The term "major energy consumer" means a country that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) had an oil consumption average of 1,000,000 barrels per day or greater in the previous year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) had an oil consumption growth rate of 8 percent or greater in the previous year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) had a natural gas consumption of 30,000,000,000 cubic meters or greater in the previous year; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) had a natural gas consumption growth rate of 15 percent or greater in the previous year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 703. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENERGY DIPLOMACY AND SECURITY.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) It is imperative to the national security and prosperity of the United States to have reliable, affordable, clean, sufficient, and sustainable sources of energy.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) United States dependence on oil imports causes tremendous costs to the United States national security, economy, foreign policy, military, and environmental sustainability.</chair>
  <chair> (3) Energy security is a priority for the governments of many foreign countries and increasingly plays a central role in the relations of the United States Government with foreign governments. Global reserves of oil and natural gas are concentrated in a small number of countries. Access to these oil and natural gas supplies depends on the political will of these producing states. Competition between governments for access to oil and natural gas reserves can lead to economic, political, and armed  conflict. Oil exporting states have received dramatically increased revenues due to high global prices, enhancing the ability of some of these states to act in a manner threatening to global stability.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Efforts to combat poverty and protect the environment are hindered by the continued predominance of oil and natural gas in meeting global energy needs. Development of renewable energy through sustainable practices will help lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and enhance international development.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Cooperation on energy issues between the United States Government and the governments of foreign countries is critical for securing the strategic and economic interests of the United States and of partner governments. In the current global energy situation, the energy policies and activities of the governments of foreign countries can have dramatic impacts on United States energy security.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) United States national security requires that the United States Government have an energy policy that pursues the strategic goal of achieving energy security through access to clean, affordable, sufficient, reliable, and sustainable sources of energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) achieving energy security is a priority for United States foreign policy and requires continued and enhanced engagement with foreign governments and entities in a variety of areas, including activities relating to the promotion of alternative and renewable fuels, trade and investment in oil, coal, and natural gas, energy efficiency, climate and environmental protection, data transparency, advanced scientific research, public-private partnerships, and energy activities in international development;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the President should ensure that the international energy activities of the United States Government are given clear focus to support the national security needs of the United States, and to this end, there should be established a mechanism to coordinate the implementation of United States international energy policy among the Federal agencies engaged in relevant agreements and activities; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the Secretary of State should ensure that energy security is integrated into the core mission of the Department of State, and to this end, there should be established within the Office of the Secretary of State a Coordinator for International Energy Affairs with responsibility for--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) developing United States international energy policy in coordination with the Department of Energy and other relevant Federal agencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) working with appropriate United States Government officials to develop and update analyses of the national security implications of global energy developments;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) incorporating energy security priorities into the activities of the Department;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) coordinating activities with relevant Federal agencies; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) coordinating energy security and other relevant functions currently undertaken by offices within the Bureau of Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, the Bureau of Democracy and Global Affairs, and other offices within the Department of State.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) the Department of Energy should be designated as the lead United States Government agency in charge of formulating and coordinating the national energy security policy of the United States, and in furtherance of these goals, there should be established within the Department of Energy an Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Security whose responsibilities should include--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) directing the development of the national energy security strategy of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) coordinating the national energy security policy of the United States with the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the National Security Council, as appropriate, to address the impact of, and integrate national security and foreign policy on, the national energy security policy of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) monitoring international and domestic energy developments to gauge their impact on the national energy security policy of the United States and implementing changes in such policy as necessary to maintain the national security and energy security of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) identifying foreign sources of energy critical to the national energy security of the United States and developing strategies in conjunction with the Department of State for ensuring United States access to critical foreign energy resources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) developing strategies for reducing United States dependence on foreign sources of energy, including demand reduction, efficiency improvement, and development of alternative and new sources of domestic energy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) developing strategies in conjunction with the Department of State for working with major international producers and consumers, including China, Russia, the European Union, and Africa, to minimize politicization of global energy resources while ensuring access through global energy markets.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 704. STRATEGIC ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) United States Government partnership with foreign governments and entities, including partnership with the private sector, for securing reliable and sustainable energy is imperative to ensuring United States security and economic interests, promoting international peace and security, expanding international development, supporting democratic reform, fostering economic growth, and safeguarding the environment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Democracy and freedom should be promoted globally by partnership with foreign governments, including in particular governments of emerging democracies such as those of Ukraine and Georgia, in their efforts to reduce their dependency on oil and natural gas imports.</chair>
  <chair> (3) The United States Government and the governments of foreign countries have common needs for adequate, reliable, affordable, clean, and sustainable energy in order to ensure national security, economic growth, and high standards of living in their countries. Cooperation by the United States Government with foreign governments on meeting energy security needs is mutually beneficial. United States Government partnership with foreign governments should include cooperation with major energy consuming  countries, major energy producing countries, and other governments seeking to advance global energy security through reliable and sustainable means.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The United States Government participates in hundreds of bilateral and multilateral energy agreements and activities with foreign governments and entities. These agreements and activities should reflect the strategic need for energy security.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to advance global energy security through cooperation with foreign governments and entities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to promote reliable, diverse, and sustainable sources of all types of energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to increase global availability of renewable and clean sources of energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) to decrease global dependence on oil and natural gas energy sources; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) to engage in energy cooperation to strengthen strategic partnerships that advance peace, security, and democratic prosperity.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to establish and expand strategic energy partnerships with the governments of major energy producers and major energy consumers, and with governments of other countries (but excluding any countries that are ineligible to receive United States economic or military assistance).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Purposes.--The purposes of the strategic energy partnerships established pursuant to subsection (c) are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to strengthen global relationships to promote international peace and security through fostering cooperation in the energy sector on a mutually beneficial basis in accordance with respective national energy policies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to promote the policy set forth in subsection (b), including activities to advance--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the mutual understanding of each country's energy needs, priorities, and policies, including interparliamentary understanding;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) measures to respond to acute energy supply disruptions, particularly in regard to petroleum and natural gas resources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) long-term reliability and sustainability in energy supply;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) the safeguarding and safe handling of nuclear fuel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) human and environmental protection;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) renewable energy production;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) access to reliable and affordable energy for underdeveloped areas, in particular energy access for the poor;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) appropriate commercial cooperation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) information reliability and transparency; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (J) research and training collaboration;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to advance the national security priority of developing sustainable and clean energy  sources, including through research and development related to, and deployment of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) renewable electrical energy sources, including biomass, wind, and solar;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) renewable transportation fuels, including biofuels;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) clean coal technologies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) carbon sequestration, including in conjunction with power generation, agriculture, and forestry; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) energy and fuel efficiency, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, flexible fuel, advanced composites, hydrogen, and other transportation technologies; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) to provide strategic focus for current and future United States Government activities in energy cooperation to meet the global need for energy security.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (e) Determination of Agendas.--In general, the specific agenda with respect to a particular strategic energy partnership, and the Federal agencies designated to implement related activities, shall be determined by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (f) Use of Current Agreements To Establish Partnerships.--Some or all of the purposes of the strategic energy partnerships established under subsection (c) may be pursued through existing bilateral or multilateral agreements and activities. Such agreements and activities shall be subject to the reporting requirements in subsection (g).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (g) Reports Required.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) INITIAL PROGRESS REPORT.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on progress made in developing the strategic energy partnerships authorized under this section.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) IN GENERAL.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 20 years, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report on agreements entered into and activities undertaken pursuant to this section, including international environment activities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) CONTENT.--Each report submitted under this paragraph shall include details on--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) agreements and activities pursued by the United States Government with foreign governments and entities, the implementation plans for such agreements and progress measurement benchmarks, United States Government resources used in pursuit of such agreements and activities, and legislative changes recommended for improved partnership; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) polices and actions in the energy sector of partnership countries pertinent to United States economic, security, and environmental interests.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 705. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY CRISIS RESPONSE MECHANISMS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Cooperation between the United States Government and governments of other countries during energy crises promotes the national security of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The participation of the United States in the International Energy Program established under the Agreement on an International Energy Program, done at Paris November 18, 1974 (27 UST 1685), including in the coordination of national strategic petroleum reserves, is a national security asset that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) protects the consumers and the economy of the United States in the event of a major disruption in petroleum supply;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) maximizes the effectiveness of the United States strategic petroleum reserve through cooperation in accessing global reserves of various petroleum products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) provides market reassurance in countries that are members of the International Energy Program; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) strengthens United States Government relationships with members of the International Energy Program.</chair>
  <chair> (3) The International Energy Agency projects that the largest growth in demand for petroleum products, other than demand from the United States, will come from China and India, which are not members of the International Energy Program. The Governments of China and India vigorously pursue access to global oil reserves and are attempting to develop national petroleum reserves. Participation of the Governments of China and India in an international petroleum reserve mechanism would promote global  energy security, but such participation should be conditional on the Governments of China and India abiding by customary petroleum reserve management practices.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) In the Western Hemisphere, only the United States and Canada are members of the International Energy Program. The vulnerability of most Western Hemisphere countries to supply disruptions from political, natural, or terrorism causes may introduce instability in the hemisphere and can be a source of conflict, despite the existence of major oil reserves in the hemisphere.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Countries that are not members of the International Energy Program and are unable to maintain their own national strategic reserves are vulnerable to petroleum supply disruption. Disruption in petroleum supply and spikes in petroleum costs could devastate the economies of developing countries and could cause internal or interstate conflict.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) The involvement of the United States Government in the extension of international mechanisms to coordinate strategic petroleum reserves and the extension of other emergency preparedness measures should strengthen the current International Energy Program.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Energy Crisis Response Mechanisms With India and China.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) AUTHORITY.--The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to establish a petroleum crisis response mechanism or mechanisms with the Governments of China and India.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) SCOPE.--The mechanism or mechanisms established under paragraph (1) should include--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) technical assistance in the development and management of national strategic petroleum reserves;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) agreements for coordinating drawdowns of strategic petroleum reserves with the United States, conditional upon reserve holdings and management conditions established by the Secretary of Energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) emergency demand restraint measures;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) fuel switching preparedness and alternative fuel production capacity; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) USE OF EXISTING AGREEMENTS TO ESTABLISH MECHANISM.--The Secretary may, after consultation with Congress and in accordance with existing international agreements, including the International Energy Program, include China and India in a petroleum crisis response mechanism through existing or new agreements.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Energy Crisis Response Mechanism for the Western Hemisphere.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) AUTHORITY.--The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to establish a Western Hemisphere energy crisis response mechanism.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) SCOPE.--The mechanism established under paragraph (1) should include--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) an information sharing and coordinating mechanism in case of energy supply emergencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) technical assistance in the development and management of national strategic petroleum reserves within countries of the Western Hemisphere;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) technical assistance in developing national programs to meet the requirements of membership in a future international energy application procedure as described in subsection (d);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) emergency demand restraint measures;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) energy switching preparedness and alternative energy production capacity; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) MEMBERSHIP.--The Secretary should seek to include in the Western Hemisphere energy crisis response mechanism membership for each major energy producer and major energy consumer in the Western Hemisphere and other members of the Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum authorized under section 706.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) International Energy Program Application Procedure.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) AUTHORITY.--The President should place on the agenda for discussion at the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency, as soon as practicable, the merits of establishing an international energy program application procedure.</chair>
  <chair> (2) PURPOSE.--The purpose of such procedure is to allow countries that are not members of the International Energy Program to apply to the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency for allocation of petroleum reserve stocks in times of emergency on a grant or loan basis. Such countries should also receive technical assistance for, and be subject to, conditions requiring development and management of national programs for energy emergency preparedness, including demand restraint,  fuel switching preparedness, and development of alternative fuels production capacity.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (e) Reports Required.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) PETROLEUM RESERVES.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that evaluates the options for adapting the United States national strategic petroleum reserve and the international petroleum reserve coordinating mechanism in order to carry out this section.</chair>
  <chair> (2) CRISIS RESPONSE MECHANISMS.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the status of the establishment of the international petroleum crisis response mechanisms described in subsections (b) and (c). The report shall include recommendations of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy for any legislation necessary  to establish or carry out such mechanisms.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) EMERGENCY APPLICATION PROCEDURE.--Not later than 60 days after a discussion by the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency of the application procedure described under subsection (d), the President should submit to Congress a report that describes--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the actions the United States Government has taken pursuant to such subsection; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) a summary of the debate on the matter before the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency, including any decision that has been reached by the Governing Board with respect to the matter.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 706. HEMISPHERE ENERGY COOPERATION FORUM.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The engagement of the United States Government with governments of countries in the Western Hemisphere is a strategic priority for reducing the potential for tension over energy resources, maintaining and expanding reliable energy supplies, expanding use of renewable energy, and reducing the detrimental effects of energy import dependence within the hemisphere. Current energy dialogues should be expanded and refocused as needed to meet this challenge.</chair>
  <chair> (2) Countries of the Western Hemisphere can most effectively meet their common needs for energy security and sustainability through partnership and cooperation. Cooperation between governments on energy issues will enhance bilateral relationships among countries of the hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere is rich in natural resources, including biomass, oil, natural gas, coal, and has significant opportunity  for production of renewable hydro, solar,  wind, and other energies. Countries of the Western Hemisphere can provide convenient and reliable markets for trade in energy goods and services.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Development of sustainable energy alternatives in the countries of the Western Hemisphere can improve energy security, balance of trade, and environmental quality and provide markets for energy technology and agricultural products. Brazil and the United States have led the world in the production of ethanol, and deeper cooperation on biofuels with other countries of the hemisphere would extend economic and security benefits.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Private sector partnership and investment in all sources of energy is critical to providing energy security in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR NUCLEAR DAMAGE CONTINGENT COST ALLOCATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings and Purpose.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) FINDINGS.--Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) (commonly known as the "Price-Anderson Act")--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for nuclear projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event of a nuclear incident in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) section 170 of that Act, in effect, provides operators of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will establish a global system--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for nuclear energy projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the event of a nuclear incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers that face potentially unlimited liability for a nuclear incidents outside the coverage of section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) by replacing a potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early source for a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the Price-Anderson incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) the combined operation of the Convention, section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), and this section will augment the quantity of assured funds available for victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers without increasing potential costs to United States operators;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation fund established by the Convention;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that neither upsets settled expectations based on the liability regime established under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) nor shifts to Federal taxpayers liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign installations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds already available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) should be used; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (J) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United States not covered by section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), a retrospective premium should be prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved from potential liability for which insurance is not available.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this section is to allocate the contingent costs associated with participation by the United States in the international nuclear liability compensation system established by the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the benefits under section 170 of that Act; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) with respect to a covered incident outside the United States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by allocating the contingent costs equitably, on the basis of risk, among the class of nuclear suppliers relieved by the Convention from the risk of potential liability resulting from any covered incident outside the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR NUCLEAR DAMAGE CONTINGENT COST ALLOCATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings and Purpose.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) FINDINGS.--Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) (commonly known as the "Price-Anderson Act")--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for nuclear projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event of a nuclear incident in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the Price-Anderson Act, in effect, provides operators of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will establish a global system--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for nuclear energy projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the event of a nuclear incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers that face potentially unlimited liability for nuclear incidents that are not covered by the Price-Anderson Act by replacing a potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the Price-Anderson incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) the combined operation of the Convention, the Price-Anderson Act, and this section will augment the quantity of assured funds available for victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers without increasing potential costs to United States operators;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation fund established by the Convention;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that does not--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) upset settled expectations based on the liability regime established under the Price-Anderson Act; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) shift to Federal taxpayers liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign installations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to my distinguished friend and colleague, the majority leader of the House, the Honorable Mr. Hoyer, a great Member of Congress and a great friend of mine.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend, the dean of the House, John Dingell of the State of Michigan, for yielding. I also thank him for his extraordinary leadership for over half a century, his father in an extended period before that, a distinguished career of service to this country and focus on the strength and growth of this country, on the health of our people, and of the opportunities for our workers. John Dingell is a giant with whom we serve. John  Dingell is a giant of a leader in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will remember one of the most solemn occasions in our Nation's history, the 66th anniversary of a "date which will live in infamy," the day in which our Nation was attacked by an enemy that we now count as an ally. Let us hope, and I believe that many years from now, this day, December 6, 2007, will be remembered by future generations as the date upon which the New Direction 110th Congress took a historic step in moving our Nation toward real energy independence and  casting off the bonds of dependence that threaten America's national, economic, and environmental security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan compromise legislation before us, the Energy Independence and Security Act, is nothing less, Mr. Speaker, than our generation's declaration of independence from foreign sources of petroleum. In particular, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Dingell, Chairman Rangel, Chairman Gordon, and so many other Chairs of committees for the extraordinary work and effort that has made this day possible, which they put forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this legislation incorporates some of the ideas in the Progress Act, legislation that I have worked on with Chairman Dingell and many of our other committee Chairs. This legislation of course, like all legislation, is not perfect. However, when we pass this bill, we will be voting to strengthen our national security, lower energy costs, grow our economy, and create new jobs and, as well, begin to reduce global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, this legislation takes groundbreaking steps, Mr. Speaker, to increase the efficiency of our vehicles, raising fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 for new cars and trucks, the first increase in fuel economy standards since 1975. This important step would not have been possible without the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and the leadership of John Dingell. I thank them both for their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision alone will save American families an estimated $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump and reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day in 2020. This single step will reduce  by one-half what we currently import from the Persian Gulf. This legislation also makes a historic commitment to American-grown biofuels, including incentives to boost the production of biofuels and the number of flex fuel and other alternative vehicles, and  establishing a tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Speaker, it requires that 15 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources; strengthens energy efficiency for a wide range of products, appliances, lighting and buildings, to reduce energy costs to consumers; and repeals tax breaks for oil companies and invests that money in clean renewable energy and American technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oil companies of course are making extraordinary profits to give them incentive to continue to provide us with the incentive that we need. But they do not need additional subsidies from this Congress. It is telling that this legislation is supported by a broad coalition of environmental, business, labor, and farm groups, as well as State and local officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, my friend and our former colleague, Dave McCurdy, president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, stated: "We believe this tough, national fuel economy bill will be good for both consumers and energy security." I want to thank Congressman McCurdy for his work on this bill, and I want to thank John Dingell, again, without whom this compromise could not have been reached. Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy said: "If it becomes law, this  deal will mark the most important step toward improving U.S. oil security in a generation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our national character was challenged by an unprovoked attack at Pearl Harbor 66 years ago. We rose to the occasion then; and through our citizens' will, intelligence and ingenuity, we prevailed, and we were strengthened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, we face a daunting but far different challenge, a challenge that compels us to confront and conquer our Nation's addiction to petroleum. This legislation will help to do so. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, not for partisan objectives or partisan reasons, but for the independence of our Nation, for the national security of our people, for the economy of our workers, and for the environment of our children, I urge my colleagues to vote for this very historic  and important bill. Vote to cast off the chains of dependency that hold us back today which threaten our economic and environmental security. Vote, my colleagues, to put America on a path to achieve energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, Mr. Speaker, let me once again say that no one in this body with whom I have ever served has focused on an issue so tenaciously, so effectively, so energetically as the Speaker of this House. When we pass this bill, it will be a testimony to her leadership and to her commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, step with history for tomorrow and our children. Vote for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respectfully disagree with our distinguished majority leader. The bill before us is a change. It may be historic, but it is not positive. We are moving from a market-based energy policy, which has served this country well for over 150 years, to a government-mandated energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We are mandating 36 billion gallons of biofuels which don't exist and probably won't exist. We are mandating that 15 percent of all investor-owned utilities be generated by renewable means, where in some States that is physically impossible. We are mandating that we improve automobile fuel economy to 35 miles per gallon by a date certain, which, if that is technically feasible, it is going to be very expensive and probably raise the average price of an automobile several thousands of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are mandating all of these things in the interests of energy security, which is a noble goal. I think we would be better off developing the domestic resources of our great land, just like it says up there in the quote from Daniel Webster, instead of engaging in government mandates which will raise costs and probably not increase supplies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is not unknown that I have had some reservations about the bill and about the procedure that has brought us to the floor. I note to you, Mr. Speaker, that this is, however, a good bill and one which I support. Indeed, this is legislation which the Nation has to have, and, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I begin with proper commendations to our Speaker, to Mr. Hoyer, to Mr. Rangel, Mr. Gordon, Mr. Peterson of Minnesota, Mr. Oberstar, Mr. Rahall, and Mr. George Miller of California, the Chairs of our colleagues' committees, for their good work and leadership on this matter, and I do salute you, Madam Speaker, for your leadership here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that the perfection of this matter or how it was handled is not a question before us, but, rather, it is what we should do about a major problem which this Nation confronts. In my extension of remarks, I will talk about the costs of failure to act at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a bill that the Committee on Energy and Commerce and my colleagues and I would have written if it had followed the regular order, nor, indeed, is it achieved under the order which we would have followed. Indeed, it is a process which is brought about in good part because of the lack of interest by the White House and, very frankly, the incompetence and the indifference and the arrogance of the other body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be voting for this legislation because it contains a number of significant landmark achievements. It will raise fuel economy standards by 40 percent, to 35 miles per gallon, and it will do it in a way which achieves and protects American jobs and it gives manufacturers proper flexibility in achieving our goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also closes what has been misleadingly, and I think dishonestly, called the SUV loophole. It expands incentives for the production of cars and trucks that run on renewable fuels, and it will help American factories to retool to build the cars and trucks of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to, at this time, pay particular compliment and congratulations to two of our very able colleagues and those who have joined them in their efforts to protect this legislation; Mr. Hill of Indiana, an extremely valuable Member of this body, and Mr. Terry, another very valuable Member of this body. These two Members from Indiana and Nebraska have provided extraordinary leadership in this matter in the Hill-Terry bill, and they deserve the thanks and the congratulations  of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation includes efficiency standards for buildings and appliances that will remove more than 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, an amount equal to five times the annual emissions of all cars on the road today in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who are concerned about portions of the bill dealing with renewable fuels and renewable electricity generation, I would simply say that this is far from the final work, and the committee will carry forward its oversight on these matters vigorously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time and at this time, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, and I ask that he be permitted to control the time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Democrat no energy plan. As senior Republican on the Education and Labor Committee, I oppose not only the bill's remarkable lack of any new energy, but also its inclusion of bureaucratic mandates that will kill American jobs and complicate job-training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just yesterday, a letter was sent to the National Economic Council Director Allan Hubbard claiming that the bill, and I quote, "Will not significantly expand the application of Davis- Bacon prevailing wage requirements." Now, I don't know how the majority defines the words "significantly expand," but by my count, this bill contains at least seven separate instances in which the Davis-Bacon wage mandates are imposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, this bill furthers the majority's aggressive application of Davis-Bacon wage mandates. Davis-Bacon wages can inflate project costs by as much as 15 percent, costs that get passed on to taxpayers. They also force private companies to do hundreds of millions of dollars of excessive administrative work each year, squandering resources that would be better spent creating jobs and spurring innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As if the job killing Davis-Bacon requirements weren't bad enough, this bill also complicates our job training system by creating a redundant and unnecessary program to expand the energy efficient and renewable energy workforce. If this no energy package becomes law, it will mean more red tape, more bureaucracy and more hurdles for job seekers. We are talking about energy efficiency. Why not talk about job training efficiency as well?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these and other reasons, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support the Democrat no energy bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while I do not favor the renewable electricity mandate, because some areas of the country simply do not have the resources available to meet its requirements, the bill before us makes a substantial and important contribution to national energy policy and I rise in support of the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its 40 separate energy efficiency provisions will reduce future greenhouse gas emissions by 10 billion tons by the year 2030. In the year 2030 alone, the reduction will equal the annual CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 emissions of all of the vehicles on America's highways at the present time. The agreement on vehicle fuel efficiency is truly a landmark achievement. </paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we heard a comparison today between December 7 and what we are passing today. December 7 began World War II in the Pacific, and if we read the history books, actually the war was lost by Japan and Germany because they ran out of oil. Japan was trying to keep us from interrupting their oil supplies and they ran out of oil. And we are absolutely disarming ourselves, taking away our own oil for the future here with this bill. I fail to see the connection that was being made  earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been told right now in this debate that we should consider what we are going to do about the problem before us. Now, the problem before us that I saw yesterday was that Dow Chemical began to ship its jobs overseas. Previously this summer they had announced $22 billion worth of investment in Saudi Arabia because the price of natural gas here is above $7, and it is below $1 there. They are simply choosing the economic choices that lie before them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when this bill first passed the House of Representatives, The Washington Post referred to it saying it would be legislation that is welcomed in Russia and Bolivia and other countries. The version before us today would still prompt the same comment, I am sure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be working to expand our manufacturing. We should be working to encourage American energy companies to expand their operations by building U.S. jobs. But this bill, today's bill, hurts our domestic manufacturers by adding $21 billion in new taxes on Americans, but no new taxes on those other foreign oil companies. We are choosing foreign over domestic producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be working to help America's forest communities biomass plants. Instead, the majority's bill prohibits this. We are stopped dead in our tracks from taking biomass out of Federal lands, out of our national forests. The mandate is let them burn; we don't want to take biomass out of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be working to expand our domestic energy supply, but instead we are restricting future supplies of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has made its choices. They are building one new coal plant each week for the next 10 years. We are choosing to not have new energy. It is the wrong bill. I would recommend a "no" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important legislation. For too long, our Nation has depended on the old way of doing things, on corrupt dictators, on non-renewable and polluting sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill today, We stand at a crossroads: we can either continue down the old, failed road, or we can move ahead with new ideas that wean us off foreign oil, clean our skies, and ensure that our children inherit a cleaner, safer world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Nevada, our legislature has required that by 2015, 20 percent of power sold to Nevadans is derived from renewables. Already, energy providers have built or planned half a dozen major solar power projects in order to meet the requirements. Nevadans are looking to the future and so are our fellow Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a great first step toward securing our energy independence. It provides the right incentives to energy providers to move to cleaner, renewable sources of energy. It sets realistic standards for utilities to provide renewable energy sources. It sets higher fuel efficiency standards so we can stop relying on corrupt dictators for our energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are far from being energy independent, but today's bill is a good place to start, and I urge my colleagues to look to the future rather than the past. Let's break from our old ways and support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank my friend and colleague for yielding and giving me the opportunity to rise in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident that this Congress will be noted for the initiative that we are voting on today and that the American people will not be as concerned with the process and the procedure as they would be as to what did the Congress do in terms of dealing with the issue of global warming as well as relieving us of the dependency on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the crucial issues that Americans have looked to us to deal with. And I don't think it can be challenged that although there are those who have objections that it is not all that they would want it to be, it is a step that all of us in Congress should be proud that we moved forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clean Renewable Energy and Conservation Tax Act of 2007, as included in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, presents a step in the right direction to present solutions to the problems that our great Nation and, indeed, the world are facing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What did we do? To accelerate the use of clean, domestic, renewable energy sources and alternative fuels; to promote the use of energy-efficient products and practices and conservation; and to increase research and development in the deployment of clean, renewable energy and efficiency technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax title of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> makes good on this promise. The compromise package includes robust incentives for renewable energy production, increased efficiency, plug-in electric drive vehicles, and incentives for carbon capture, as well as the sequestration of coal demonstration projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package facilitates and advances the development of advanced electricity infrastructure, it contains incentives to mitigate carbon remissions, it promotes the production of renewable energy and security of our domestic fuel supply, and it encourages energy savings and efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package cost is fully offset by including certain provisions that were  loopholes that were undeserved of being given to oil and gas giveaways, not to the smaller suppliers of oil, but to the very largest that have had obscene profits without the benefits of the technology necessary to remove the dependency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the package will repeal the domestic manufacturing incentive for the top five integrated producers while freezing reductions at 6 percent for all others in the oil and gas sector. The package tightens foreign tax credit rules for foreign oil and gas extraction income and foreign oil-related income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I want to take this particular time to thank Steny Hoyer, Nancy Pelosi, and, more particularly, John Dingell for bringing together the interests and concerns of the standing committees and having us come forward as a body to fulfill the commitment that we made earlier on that we were going to respond to the needs of the people of our great Nation and certainly to the people of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do hope that while there has been a lot of partisanship in terms of lack of cooperation on the other side, that at the end of the day when people at town hall meetings or our children and grandchildren would ask the questions, what did we do, we can say we supported this great historic piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was driving in this morning listening to the radio and I heard an ad. The ad said, vote for the bipartisan energy bill when it comes up today, and it told you to call your local Congressperson. Who are you going to call? Not even Ghost Busters can find a Republican to make this a bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our energy needs in this country are going to grow by about 50 percent by the year 2030, and there is no question that we need to do a better job on conservation, looking for alternative fuels; but this bill doesn't do that. This bill is not the bipartisan piece of legislation that we want. There is no bipartisan bill on the House floor. There is no Republican substitute. There were no Republican amendments. There was not even a conference named to try and iron out differences between the House  and the Senate. Virtually, there was no Republican involvement or input on this legislation at all. And so, therefore, as a consequence, there are no Republicans at least on this side of the aisle that can make the bill bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, we passed an important energy bill, and it was bipartisan. Chairman Barton did a terrific job in the hearings and the conference that we had, and it enjoyed the support then of Ranking Member Dingell to make sure that in fact it was bipartisan. But raising taxes, which this bill does, on energy producers is the last thing that our Nation needs as our consumers try and grapple with higher energy costs, whether that be heating or gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, in an important hearing, my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) offered advice to the panel that was there when he took over the chairmanship of our important committee, Energy and Commerce. And he said this. He said: "The Parliamentarian told me that the process needed to be fair and there needed to be a perception of fairness." Mr. Speaker, I lament that this bill is neither. It is not fair nor is the perception there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for too long we have depended on a handful of finite energy resources to power our economy. So as energy prices inevitably rise, we can continue to hand our money over to foreign interests, or we can invest that in our own country's energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the U.S. and world leaders are meeting to define the steps needed to address the challenge of climate change. This energy package will help give our country the technological bump needed to address CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 emissions and our dependency on foreign energy. This bill will invest in a wide range of energy technologies that use clean natural resources from the sun, the oceans, and our Earth. It will boost the energy efficiency of our vehicles, buildings, and heavy industries. And this bill provides significant increased investment in technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-fired plants. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that, over the last year, the Science and Technology Committee has worked hard to clear 14 bipartisan consensus-driven energy and environment research bills, nine of which are included in the House package. So I want to take this opportunity to thank those Democrat and Republican members of our committee, and the minority and majority staff, for their hard and good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Mr. Speaker, let me just respond to my friend who says if you vote for this bill, the price of energy is going to go up. The fact of the matter is we all know, whether you vote for or against this bill, the price of energy is going to go up. The question is, are we going the write the check to foreign energy cartels, or are we going to invest that money here in America in clean alternative energy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am voting for America. I am voting for this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have just heard Mr. Dingell mention World War II and Pearl Harbor and I heard Mr. Pearce answer him; and they are both correct in what they said, that that was an energy war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember like yesterday, I was 17 years old standing on the banks of the Tombigbee River in Alabama, and a guy ran down and said the Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor. I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was. I said, we had better hitchhike back to Dallas; those Japanese will go straight to Washington. I thought Pearl Harbor was down around Mobile somewhere. That is how ignorant I was about the Nation at that time, but I am a little smarter now. And I remember well that Cordell Hull and Henry  Stimson cut the energy off from Japan. They had 13 months' national existence. They had to break out and go somewhere, and we had to know they were going to. That was an energy war. So I am a little disappointed in the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the campaign, they blamed the Republicans for high energy prices. Here, before us today, is a bill that the Democrats are touting as the end to high energy prices. There is one big obvious problem with the bill: there is nothing in this bill that will bring any relief to the citizens of our great country or that will lower the cost of a tank of gasoline or the monthly electricity bills. It will likely in fact have the opposite effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill authorizes billions and billions of dollars in new government spending programs, and mandates electric companies to use more expensive ways for electricity generation, whether they are able to or whether they are not able to. If you don't think that is going to make your electricity bill go up even more, then you are not really being realistic. Electric companies are a business just like any other business; and if their costs go up, they are going to pass them along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need to mandate Federal renewable electricity standards. Twenty-eight States and the District of Columbia already have a renewable portfolio standard in place. These standards were made on the State level based on what renewable sources are available in each State, and it is wrong for the Federal Government to enforce a one-size-fits-all standard. My home State of Texas has a very successful RPS. Since its inception in 1999, Texas has become the Nation's leader in wind energy. In June  of this year, a Texan put forward plans to build the Nation's largest wind farm in the panhandle of the State. This would be four times larger than the current wind farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone, anyone who is serious about lowering the cost of gasoline, then, along with research and development and renewable sources of energy, they would be providing incentives to the oil and gas industry to explore more areas of our country for oil and gas. They would be providing incentives to develop our domestic sources of oil and gas. They would be providing incentives to build more refineries. These  things are not only important to address today's  high cost, but also for our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot forget that we import a huge amount of oil from OPEC countries that are willing to take our American dollars, but many are not really our friends. We are shamefully dependent on foreign sources of oil. We can't continue to compromise our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another opportunity the Democrats completely ignore in this bill is a chance to promote the use of clean coal for much-needed new power plants and as a source of transportation fuel. It has been said before that the United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. So why are we not encouraging the environmentally friendly use of this abundant and inexpensive domestic resource? These facilities would have the best technologies to capture emissions in order to produce clean electricity and the clean  fuel that can be used immediately in our Nation's pipelines, filling stations, and in our automobiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents are doing their part to help the environment, but they need to be able to afford to put gas in their cars so they can get to work to provide food for their families and clothes for their children. A lot of my constituents don't have transportation options. There is no bus system or rail system. They live 45 miles from work, so they certainly can't take a bike. They need their cars. They need the fuel that they put into them to be affordable. I don't see a glimmer of hope for them  in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do feel very strongly that we should be looking to efficiency, conservation, and renewable alternatives of energy to become part of our portfolio. And I support the provisions in this bill that do that; however, there are so many harmful things in this bill that I think the bad, ugly highly outweighs the good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported and voted for the bipartisan R&amp;D provisions as they existed coming out of the Science and Technology Committee and generally remain supportive. However, I am concerned with some changes and additions made in this amendment, changes that came about without the opportunity for vetting or Member involvement. Participation by all Members leads to a better product, and we know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 garnered the support of 38 Democrats who are still in the House when initially passed by the House. When brought to the floor later that year for final passage, it garnered the support of almost 70 Democrats who are still in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I can't stress how important energy is to our country. We have urged drilling in the Outer Shelf. Yes, China drills just off the coast of Key West today. And we have urged drilling in ANWR. I urge our colleagues not to play politics with our energy future.</paragraph>

I want to thank the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and the skill and experience and the knowledge of Congressman John Dingell for all of this help on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a remarkable day for the United States House of Representatives and, hopefully, for the people of this country as we break the chokehold of those Middle Eastern countries that have us tied to them because of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy independence that we talk about in this legislation is the ability, through the savings, through fuel-efficient automobiles, through fuel-efficient appliances, through fuel-efficient houses and businesses and buildings that the savings that we will be able to have with respect to the use of energy and oil in this country will allow America to make decisions based upon the American interests and not the interests of other countries because we are tied to them because we do not have  energy efficiency in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a remarkable piece of legislation for the benefits that it will provide for American consumers at the gas pump, at the department store when they buy new appliances, when they buy new homes, when they go to work in new buildings, when they start businesses in more energy-efficient buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the kinds of benefits that we can have because we have renewable energy, we have fuel standards, and we have a new CAFE standard that is a 40 percent increase in the efficiency of automobiles that Americans will buy into the future that will break that tether to that high price, $3.50 gasoline as it is in California. They will be able to go further on each one of those gallons of gasoline. That is what we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also creates over 3 million jobs in the green industry that are supported by this legislation that encourages that investment in wind and biofuels and solar energy. Those 3 million jobs, we are 8 years late coming to those jobs, but they are in this legislation; and those jobs will be created in almost every sector of the economy no matter what geographical area people live in. But we need to develop those skills. And I want to thank John Tierney and Hilda Solis for  their efforts on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what the people who are betting their money on the future of the high-tech companies, people who are betting their money in terms of venture capitalists, that this is where they told us to go to generate the next generation of innovation, of technology, was in energy. And that is what we are going to do, and America is going to have a much better energy future as a result of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no question this is a historic day. This bill will substantially increase fuel economy standards for the first time in over 20 years, increase energy efficiency requirements, and promote research and development of alternative sources. These are all worthy accomplishments, and the efforts of Chairman Dingell should be commended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The only opportunity this Congress missed was to create a balanced energy policy that invests in our energy future without ignoring America's energy needs today. I believe as Democrats, we could have crafted a sensible energy policy that actually enhances our energy security, but that would require bringing all Democrats to the table, including those of us who represent districts that produce energy needed to heat our homes, fuel our vehicles, and generate our economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some improvements from the previous bill, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, have been made, new additions that have not been thoroughly debated have been included and could have a negative impact on the cost of energy in our area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that reason, I must vote against the legislation and hope that we can instead vote on an energy bill that is focused on provisions we can agree on, such as a bill to increase CAFE standards, energy efficiency standards, and that would actually increase energy security in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly disappointed in the lack of discussion on the renewable fuel standard, RFS, which was not included in our House bill and was not moved through any regular process in the House of Representatives. It is premature to consider expanding the RFS until our current one is fully implemented, and we run the risk of negative environmental impacts, questionable greenhouse gas emissions, and increased food and energy prices with a focus on corn-based ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A sensible approach would have been to require RFS to include, prior to taking effect, a clear mechanism to reduce the mandate in case the environmental challenges, technological, or feasibility  of supply issues, or projected food price increases were impacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes tax provisions outside of those carefully negotiated earlier in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> that actually tilt the competitive playing field for global energy resources against U.S.-based oil and gas companies and discourage the expansion of natural gas distribution systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been an effort to moderate some of the tax provisions passed early in August, particularly by retaining current deduction levels under section 199 for our Nation's independent producers. I am glad that happened, but I am concerned with the impact on my constituents and their electricity bills with a Federal renewable electricity standard, the RES. Under a one-size-fits-all mandate, Texas utilities may be forced to make payments to the Federal Government to meet a 20 percent target or  a 15 percent target, or 11 percent, now we hear it is 11 percent, ultimately driving up costs for the utility, the electricity users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Congress would capitalize on this historic moment and actually make it to where we could pass an energy bill that would be bipartisan. We could instead have a more sensible bill that focused on the provisions we all agree on, increase CAFE standards and energy standards, and that would meet with Senate and Presidential approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no question this is a truly historic day for Congress. This bill will substantially increase fuel economy standards for the first time in over 20 years, increase energy efficiency requirements, and promote research and development of alternative sources of energy. These are all worthy accomplishments and the efforts of the Chairman should be commended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only opportunity this Congress missed, Mr. Speaker, was to create a balanced energy policy that invests in our energy future without ignoring America's energy needs today. I believe as Democrats we can craft sensible-energy policy that actually enhances our energy security, but that would require bringing all Democrats to the table, including those of us who represent Districts that produce the energy needed to heat our homes, fuel our vehicles, and generate our economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that day will come, but after reviewing some of the proposals contained in this legislation, it is clear we have a long way to go. While some improvements from <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> have been made, new additions that have not been thoroughly debated by this House and that could have a negative impact on the cost of energy have been included.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that reason, I must regrettably vote against this legislation and hope that we instead vote on an energy bill that is focused on the provisions we can all agree on--such as a bill to increase CAF&#xC9; and energy efficiency standards--and that will actually increase the energy security of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly disappointed in the lack of discussion and debate with various stakeholders when crafting the expanded Renewable-Fuel Standard, RFS, which was not included in the House-passed bill, was not considered by the Energy and Commerce Committee, and was not moved through the regular process of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's premature to consider expanding the RFS before our current one is even fully-implemented, and we run the risk of ultimately shifting the nation's dependency on petroleum to another fuel that's costly, less efficient, and many unintended consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no shortage of literature detailing the negative environmental impacts of corn- based ethanol, including soil erosion, herbicide and insecticide pollution, aquifer depletion, and loss and degradation of wildlife habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its effect on greenhouse gas emissions are questionable, and many studies find that the amount of energy needed to produce ethanol is roughly equal to the amount of energy obtained from its combustion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biggest loser in the blind push for ethanol is the American consumer. I come from a low-income area in Texas where families struggle to make ends meet. When you account for the increased cost of transporting ethanol, its reduced fuel efficiency, and higher food prices due to increased corn demand, all our constituents will take a substantial hit to their pocketbooks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with this, I had hoped to sit down with different RFS stakeholders to find a reasonable solution to address these concerns. A sensible approach would have been to require the RFS to include--prior to taking effect--a clear mechanism to reduce the mandate in the case of environmental challenges, infrastructure bottlenecks, technological, feasibility or supply issues, projected food price increases, adverse weather conditions, harm to livestock producers, or other adverse consequences. Such  evaluations could be repeated on a periodic basis to ensure these conditions do not materialize. Unfortunately, this idea did not have the opportunity for an open discussion and debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this Congress supports this expansion, I hope we at least understand the energy requirements we'll need to meet the mandate. Most of the energy used to produce ethanol comes from natural gas or electricity. A Congressional Research Service report concluded that an increase in corn ethanol to 15 billion gallons would require an increase in natural gas consumption, ultimately substituting energy demand from one fossil fuel to another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always believed clean-burning natural gas will play a critical role in addressing our nation's energy needs; I just hope we remember the important role natural gas will play in this RFS mandate as we debate future proposals affecting domestic natural gas supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, I believe we cannot keep taxing American's energy industry and expect to have adequate supplies of energy. This bill includes tax provisions outside of those carefully negotiated in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> that could actually tilt the competitive playing field for global energy resources against U.S. based oil and gas companies and discourage the expansion of natural gas distribution systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This increase in new taxes targeted at the U.S. energy industry could reduce our Nation's energy security by discouraging new domestic oil and gas production and new investments in refinery capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased, however, by the effort made to moderate some of the tax provisions from <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, particularly by retaining the current deduction levels under Section 199 for our Nation's independent producers. While it is fundamentally unfair to treat energy companies differently than other companies under the manufacturers tax credit, at least  this provision does not also punish independent producers which develop 90 percent of domestic oil and natural gas wells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am concerned with the impact on my constituents' electricity bills with a federal Renewable Electricity Standard, or RES.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to come from a State that has an impressive RES that meets the needs of our region. Unlike most state RES plans, which are based on a specific percentage of sales, the Texas RES plan has a fixed statewide renewable capacity requirement of 5,880 megawatts, MW, by 2015, which would represent about 5 percent of the State's energy capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't a question of whether or not we should encourage states to produce more electricity from renewable sources--we should. The question is whether a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate, as contained in this legislation, is the best way to accomplish this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to meet a 15 percent Federal RES by 2020, Texas utilities may be forced to make payments to the Federal Government to meet this mandate, ultimately driving up energy costs for all electricity users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I wish that Congress would capitalize on this historic moment and move forward with an energy bill that unites all sides of the Caucus. We could have instead moved a more sensible bill that focused on the provisions we all agree on--like increased CAF&#xC9; and energy efficiency standards--which would meet Senate approval and be signed by the President. I hope this opportunity to move consensus-based legislation is not squandered for the sake of a simple sound bite or press release.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward in this Congress, I hope the House of Representatives will actually address America's need to produce additional domestic energy, both conventional and renewable, to ensure the reliability and affordability of our nation's critical energy supplies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me to support the Energy Independence and Security Act. With this bill, we will turn from the past to the future. We have begun the process of adopting energy policies that recognize the science of global warming and the threat to our Nation's energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will finally give Americans the fuel-efficient automobiles they want, saving families $700 to $1,000 a year. That is money we won't be sending to dangerous regimes in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will finally give Americans more power from clean, affordable, renewable energy sources, using wind, solar and biomass. We can produce energy here and at home and fight global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will give Americans more efficient appliances and consumer  goods, saving us hundreds of billions of dollars on electricity bills over the next few decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there are some things this legislation will not do. It won't diminish the EPA's authority to address global warming, which the Supreme Court has recognized. It won't seize authority from the States to act on global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has threatened to veto this bill because it takes away taxpayer subsidies to oil companies and supports new renewable energy technologies. It is time for the President to do what the American people want, not what the oil companies want.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the third time this year that I have stood before this body to debate a tax bill dealing with energy. Like the debates before, the bill before us today has more to do with politics than policy. It is indeed Orwellian logic to say that gas prices are too high; therefore, we ought to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry. Hmm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority claims that American manufacturing jobs are important, but it is pursuing tax policies that will drive good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority claims to be adhering to PAYGO; yet by clever sleight of hand, they have included an additional $900 million in tax relief for New York that falls just outside the budget window, thereby evading PAYGO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the majority, despite its stated concerns about tax earmarks, seems to have a massive one in here of a $500 million tax credit bond program that appears to benefit one single landowner. A rifle shot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as has been discussed in the past, creates tax credit bonds that State and local governments can use with little accountability and without any assurances that funded projects will reduce fossil fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, those tax credit bonds would be tradable, setting up a market for tax credits very similar to something that Congress tried back in 1981 and repealed the very next year because of the outcry of the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't expect this bill to make it through the process. I don't think it will get through the Senate. If it were to, the President would most certainly veto this bill, but maybe then we can go back to the drawing board on a bipartisan basis to craft an energy bill that actually produces energy and reduces costs and protects American jobs. Until then, I urge my colleagues to defeat what is an ill-conceived bill. We have wasted more energy today debating it than its passage would  possibly create.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am here to address the contribution of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy Independence and Security Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We begin with the Department of Energy, itself, by providing funding to build a photovoltaic solar wall on the south wall of the Department of Energy. It was built without windows or doors to accommodate a solar application, but the funding was never provided over the last 12 years. The project will pay for itself in less than 18 years and then begin sending excess energy into the local power grid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We continue with the U.S. Capitol. We require the Architect of the Capitol to undertake feasibility studies on installing photovoltaic roofs on two buildings, Rayburn and Hart, and also a feasibility study to capture, store and use carbon dioxide from the Capitol power plant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spread these efforts further across the Nation by requiring the General Services Administration to install energy-efficient and renewable energy systems, including compact fluorescent bulbs and photovoltaic systems on Federal office buildings and U.S. courthouses across the country. We also prohibit the Coast Guard from using incandescent light bulbs unless they determine they are necessary for their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes critical targets for GSA and other Federal civilian agencies to cut energy use by 30 percent and fossil fuel use 65 percent within a decade. Within 25 years under provisions in this bill, all fossil fuel use in Federal buildings will be eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transportation. We authorize in law a Center for Climate Change and Environment under the Department of Transportation, which has existed by administrative action but has not been effective. It will be under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We increase the Federal share for congestion mitigation and air quality improvement highway funds to 100 percent for incentives for States to use funds to finance alternatives for people driving alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We authorize $40 million for short line and regional railroads to buy green locomotives, $200 million for track improvements to encourage movement of goods by rail, and a new short sea shipping program to move goods by more efficient means. Short sea shipping is short-haul movement of goods by water to avoid congestion areas. Widely used in Europe, they have a vast network of short sea transportation routes. The bill will promote use of such shipping opportunities on the Great Lakes and on the  saltwater coast of the United States, using the Capital Construction Fund, building ships in the United States, including in the State of Wisconsin, to build short sea shipping vessels to avoid congestion in places like Chicago. We make a real, solid contribution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the next 40 years, electricity demand in the United States will double. We have to conserve. We have to make strides in efficiency and renewable energy, but we can't depend on renewable power alone. It would take 3,000 huge windmills or 11 square miles of solar collectors to equal the power output of one modern coal plant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if we quadrupled the share of renewable power by 2050, we will still need coal for half of our electricity. To meet America's future energy needs, we will probably need to build 800 new coal plants over the next 40 years: 400 to replace the old, inefficient plants and 400 to meet the growth and demand. This translates to one coal plant every 2 to 3 weeks, even if we start in 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Solving the problem will require clean coal technologies with zero emissions, including greenhouse gases. Let's solve American's energy problems by cleaning up America's abundant energy resources. This bill, however, will tax America's abundant supplies of coal, and that just doesn't make sense.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize myself for 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to comment further on some of the very positive things this legislation does in order to move forward national energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is truly a landmark achievement. The legislation that we have before the House opens the door to an entirely new era in which we will tap new forms of domestic energy resources and lessen this country's reliance on energy imports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure broadly incents the creation of new alternatives to today's traditional energy resources: from consumer appliance standards, which will be improved across a range of home appliances through this measure, to energy-sensitive building codes; to the capture of waste heat from industry that could produce the energy necessary to generate fully 60 gigawatts of electricity with no additional emissions of greenhouse gases; to the creation of a smart electricity grid that will lead to the  day when consumers of electricity in their home can save money by consuming more electricity  during times of low demand when prices are lower; to a major increase in automobile fuel efficiency, for which I want to commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell)</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In all of these ways, this bill makes a major advance in national energy policy. It will make America more energy efficient and energy independent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, we also make an important down payment in addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions. And next year, beginning with work in our House Energy and Commerce Committee, we will take another landmark step in that direction as, in consultation with external stakeholders, and on a bipartisan basis with our Republican colleagues on the committee and in the House, we will structure a mandatory approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, an economy-wide  program that will enjoy bipartisan support and spread the burden of greenhouse gas emissions equally across this economy. That approach begins in the year to come and will make a further enormous contribution to controlling emissions.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about one particular provision in this bill which really puzzles me, and that is the tax earmark that's in this bill. This bill creates forestry conservation tax credit bonds. Sounds pretty innocent on its face. But reading through the language, the provision has little to do with forestry, and didn't appear to require the protection of a single tree. Rather, it's nominally about protecting fish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, to qualify for the tax credit bond program, the parcel of land to be purchased must be adjacent to the Forest Service land; have a portion of that land turned over to the U.S. Forest Service; include at least 40,000 total acres, and must be subject to a "native fish habitat conservation plan approved by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, there is only one piece of land in America that meets this description. It's a piece of land in Montana owned by a timber giant, Plum Creek. And according to press reports, they intend to sell it to the Nature Conservancy, which can get the $500 million in bonds, who could give that $500 million, buy it from Plum Creek, turn around and sell it to landowners, for all we know. If this isn't a tax earmark, I don't know what is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the point is, this is a tax earmark. And why is it possible to add this provision which is a tax earmark?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the anti-earmark rules that we have here in the House only apply to conference reports and bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are we considering today? Technically, it's an amendment to the Senate bill which was an amendment to the original House-passed bill. So the earmark rules we have are thrown out the window. No earmark rules apply here. That's how you can sneak this provision in, a $500 million tax earmark provision to go to one private landowner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we can't be exactly sure what the deal here is because the bill just got released. We don't know who asked for this provision or exactly how it will be used, but at the very least, serious questions ought to be raised about such an expensive provision dropped into this bill to benefit one particular landowner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, this bill may not technically violate PAYGO, but it sure does violate the spirit of PAYGO. It uses timing shifts and other budget gimmicks to violate PAYGO. For this and many other reasons, I urge a "no" vote on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Small businesses are not just the most impacted by high energy costs, but small businesses are also leaders in domestic protection of energy. They make up 80 percent of all renewable fuels producers in this country. This legislation makes them part of the solution. It does this by developing innovative new technologies, reduces carbon emission, increases clean renewable energy production, and modernizes our energy infrastructure. Much of this was accomplished under the leadership of Congressman</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry that we're on the floor here today. This year I've yelled on this floor. I've cried on this floor. I've stormed off this floor. So today I decided to be the still, small voice in support of coal, in support of the internal combustion engine, and in support of national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois alone is the Saudi Arabia of coal. If you want to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil, coal has to be in an energy bill. It just has to. And to deny that is a failure on public policy ramifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I here hold in my hand an internal combustion engine, much maligned on the floor and in the world today. It's 1.5 horsepower. It's lighter and it's easier to carry than 1 1/2  horses. And we have to imagine the benefits to this world that the internal combustion engine has caused, how it's uplifted the poor and the downtrodden. But this bill attacks the internal combustion engine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on national security, coal-to-liquid fuel and natural gas, the evidence is clear: the Department of Defense wants to relieve itself of reliance on imported crude oil. They are seeking support of coal-to-liquid applications for jet fuel. The United States Air Force is the number one consumer of aviation fuel. Our coal fields to our refineries, to our pipelines, to our jet planes is the way in which we can decrease our reliance on imported crude oil and protect our national security interests.  This bill does nothing in that respect. Vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize myself for 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't let pass the suggestion that there is nothing in this legislation that advances the interests of the domestic coal industry in the United States. In fact, there are two very important provisions that address the future needs for coal. The first of these will stimulate the development of carbon dioxide pipelines that will enable carbon dioxide to be transported across long distances from the place where carbon dioxide is separated out of the coal combustion process to the place where it's  injected for permanent storage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, secondly, there is an investment tax credit totaling $1.5 billion that is available for companies that will take the step to develop those carbon separation and sequestration technologies. And carbon separation and sequestration truly is the future of coal. In a  carbon constrained environment, it's critically important that coal-fired utilities be able to continue to use that fuel and to do so consistently with whatever the limits on carbon dioxide  emissions are. The ability to separate carbon dioxide out of the combustion process and transport it to permanent storage in the ground is the answer that we'll be relying on in future years. This bill helps to make that possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in less than 12 months this Congress will do what previous Congresses have failed to do for 32 years. Today, after 32 years of failure, we can take America's energy policy in a new direction. And that failure was through Democratic Congresses and Republican Congresses alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today this House has the opportunity to pass modern energy legislation that will accomplish a hat trick. It will make our vehicles more fuel efficient, help limit our dependence on foreign oil, and protect our environment, all in one act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new fuel efficiency standards will save the American family up to $1,000 a year for gas at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly, this bill offers us an opportunity to look to the future and prepare for it. Make change an ally, rather than an adversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each and every one of us knows, Democrat and Republican alike, that our Nation consumes too much energy. We know that we are dangerously dependent on an unstable region of the world and we know that this isn't news to anybody here, and we have recognized these facts for years. But when faced with this problem, we, as a country, have turned our back on that problem, hoping it will go away. This legislation allows us to face those challenges head on and prepare for America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the problem will not go a way, and today we have a chance to confront it when faced with the facts and vote to make our Nation more secure, reduce oil consumption, and finally plan for a more energy-independent future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can bury our heads in the sand and hope the problem disappears, or we can take action today and prepare for the future and make the challenges of America's future an opportunity for industry, for new jobs, for new businesses and, most importantly, for foreign policy and national security policy that is less dependent on an unstable part of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that today we are taking action that for 32 years past Congresses failed to meet and challenge.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we could spend all day talking about the shortcomings and faults of this legislation, not to mention the process under which it came to the floor. However, the most glaring and ironic dominance from this energy bill is the lack of production of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we need to be discussing is a sound and realistic energy policy that is going to help America become energy independent. This means increasing domestic energy production by expanding oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf at Alaska, not taxing oil companies $20 billion simply because they're in business. We need to increase research and provide incentives for oil, shale, and coal-to-liquid technologies. Coal is one of the country's most abundant natural resources, and recent  estimates of oil shale in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah could provide us with over 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about refining capacities? We have not built a refinery in this country in over 30 years, and our current refineries are operating near maximum capacity.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill charts an ambitious, necessary and long-overdue new direction for energy policy in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After more than three decades, we increase fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, a commonsense step that will save $1,000 for American families at the pump, that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking 28 million cars off the road, and by reducing our oil consumption by half, half, of what we import from the Persian Gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made in this bill an historical commitment to homegrown biofuels by boosting the renewable energy standards. We are enlisting America's families and farmers to build a sustainable clean energy future and have done so in a way that also protects our environment, like the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To unleash the economic environmental benefits of our rapidly growing renewable energy industries, we include a strong renewable electricity portfolio standard that will reduce greenhouse gases and save consumers money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also include a fully paid-for $21 billion incentive package that redirects $13 billion in antiquated subsidies to our already profitable oil industry toward clean, green technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those who are thinking about voting against this bill, I would ask what kind of signal does that send to America? That the Congress thinks it's more important to continue yesterday's billion dollars of subsidies and giveaways to the oil and gas industry rather than invest in clean technologies? That we should wait another 30 years before making commonsense improvements in our fuel economy standards? That we should sit idly by while our national security is increasingly undermined by our addiction  to foreign oil? Is that the message you want to send to America?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Refusing to act now would be irresponsible. Moreover, failing to see the opportunities that this bill brings and the challenges we face is contrary to the can-do American spirit that has propelled our Nation from the beginning.</paragraph>

It is the result of some negotiations primarily between select Members of the majority here in the House and the majority in the Senate. It does put this Nation on a different path. It puts us  on a path of moving away from market-based, free capital energy production to  government mandates. Now, that may be what the majority of the House of Representatives wants to do, but I don't think it is what the American people want to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a 36 billion biofuels mandate with submandates for separate categories of biofuels that under current technology simply doesn't exist, can't be met. We already have an ethanol mandate from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that has exceeded its wildest expectation in terms of spurring incentives for ethanol. In fact, it's been so successful, the price of corn has doubled and cattle producers and chicken producers, hog farmers are having trouble buying feed for their animals because of the  increase in the price of corn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a mandate in this bill for Federal energy efficiency building code standards with the goal by a date certain of having most buildings in the United States on a net basis not using any energy at all. There doesn't appear to be a cost-effective benefit analysis requirement in that particular mandate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have already said, we have the mandate to increase fuel efficiency for our cars and trucks to 35 miles a gallon by the year 2020. It does maintain a separate standard for trucks and cars. We need to thank Chairman Dingell for making that happen in negotiations with the Senate. But this mandate is technically possible to meet. Keep in mind that under current regulations there are only eight cars and trucks in the United States that meet 35 miles to the gallon. We are certainly going  to raise the price of cars and trucks and probably reduce the amount of jobs in this country that are effective in the automobile assembly and manufacture and their vendor components industry. We have appliance standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker. Suffice it to say I don't think the country wants the government controlling energy, and that's what this bill leads us to. I hope we would vote against it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi; and to Chairman John Dingell for bringing to the floor of this House of Representatives the most productive and forward-looking piece of energy legislation that we have seen in this Congress now in 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are increasingly dependent upon energy from outside of America. In our country, we possess less than 3 percent of the known oil reserves around the world; yet on a daily basis, day after day, year after year, we are using 25 percent of that which is used, and that number is increasing. As a consequence of all of that, the price of energy has gone up to heat American homes, making it more and more difficult for the economic circumstances of families all across America and for transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of the last 7 years, the price of gasoline has increased by more than four times. It has more than quadrupled over the course of the last 4 years. And a lot of that has to do with the energy legislation that has been produced by the minority party over the course of that time in connection with the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation begins to alter all of that. It begins to move us to a point where we can begin to be more energy independent by focusing our attention and our resources on renewable, alternative forms of energy, particularly solar energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's interesting that Thomas Edison, one of the first energy producers in our country, made the observation that solar energy is the most productive, the most sustainable, and the one that we are going to have to depend on. And he said that an awfully long time ago. It ought to be clear to us now--he was right then, he is more right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's what this legislation does. It moves us toward energy independence. It allows people and corporations to produce energy through alternative means, particularly solar. That, in and of itself, is going to mean a huge economic improvement for our country and the production of hundreds of thousands of jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's all pass this legislation. It is very much needed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe I have 4 minutes remaining, 1 of which will be used by the minority leader to close. My other speaker, Mr. Blunt, is not on the floor, so I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Texas that on our side, we only have one speaker remaining and then a speaker who will close. And so hopefully your speaker before your closer will appear.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the interest of comity, the Republican whip is not on the floor, so I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the renewable portfolio standard that is in the bill. This would require investor-owned utilities in the country to generate 15 percent of their electricity by renewable means by a date certain. And there was a phase-in so that beginning, I believe, in 2010 or 2011 there is a cascade stair step that each year they have to meet a higher percentage. Information that we have received from the Department of Energy indicates that of the 50 States, there are only seven  that currently meet that requirement. Those are Alaska, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, Vermont, and California. There is another handful of States that come close: North Dakota, New Hampshire, Wyoming, New Mexico, Idaho, South Dakota, Alabama, and Iowa all meet within 10 percent to 8 percent. The rest of the States, which is approximately 40 States, don't even come close, and some of them, like Delaware and Missouri, are at 0 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you would think that a 15 percent requirement might be doable. The problem is definitional, what is defined as "renewable." New hydro is not defined as renewable. New nuclear is not defined as renewable. New clean coal technology is not defined as a renewable. So it has to be from geothermal, wind power, solar power, or biomass or hydro refitting. Now, when you look at it in that regard, this 15 percent requirement in certain parts of the country is almost impossible to meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To compound the problem, the legislation before us says that States that don't meet the requirement can't go out; they can only buy credits to offset that requirement. I believe it says up to 27 percent of their amount that they have to meet. So you are going to put a State like Florida, a State like Georgia, some of the States that are at the lower end of the curve, Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Illinois, Utah, Maryland, New Jersey, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, these States  are all somewhere between 0 to 2 percent. They're simply not going to be able to do it. They are not going to be able to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while a renewable portfolio standard for electricity generation might seem like it's a wise idea in principle, when you put it into actuality, it is going to be almost an impossible idea to meet. And this bill says "tough." So I would hope that we vote "no" on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January the process for energy legislation has been a disgrace. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> was never considered by any Committees, no hearings no mark-ups. <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, a second try at an energy bill, was also bad. Only hours notice of the bill before mark-up; limited floor amendments; many bad provisions never considered in hearings; final passage on a Saturday with many members absent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The process since then has been far worse. I am aware of no Member discussions since August 4. If they have taken place no Member on my side of the aisle was invited or informed. The result: the terrible legislation before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pelosi "energy bill" consciously raises consumer costs for fuel, vehicles, and electricity while reducing consumer choices. It favors a few special interest investors at the expense of ordinary Americans and the U.S. economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On CAFE: The bill raises fuel efficiency standards so high that consumers will face only three possible consequences: far smaller cars and trucks, far more expensive cars and trucks, or--more likely--both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm told that all but 8 out of some 350 models currently available in American showrooms would be banned from the market as the new fuel standards fully phase in. Moderate income consumers will be hardest hit. They don't buy hybrids today because the multi-thousand dollar premium for electric hybrid technology cannot pay for itself in fuel savings, even at today's sky-high fuel costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because consumers will prefer their older vehicles that match their needs better than the  new car inventory, they will postpone trading in as long as possible. New car sales will plummet; manufacturing companies and their employees will suffer. The ones who won't agree are simply in denial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On renewable fuel mandates: The levels of corn-based and other biofuels required to be part of the U.S. fuel mix will drive up all fuel costs dramatically, even over today's high prices. Diverting corn from food and feed use to fuel has already cost consumers plenty in rising chicken, turkey, beef, and soft drink prices. This bill will only make that problem worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also mandates advanced biofuels that exist today only in laboratories and which may never be commercially available. It's like passing a law mandating that a horse not even born yet grow up to win the Kentucky Derby. The only way to do that is to bar other horses from the competition, as this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Renewable Electricity Mandate: The bill would require electric companies across the United States (except in Hawaii and Alaska--they have special carve-outs) to generate 15 percent of their power from "renewable energy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States that have the natural renewable resource base needed to meet such mandates already have them under state law. Remaining States that cannot meet the standard will have to buy their way out at consumer expense, as the bill provides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the bill has some non-controversial energy efficiency provisions some sections are particularly harmful to consumers and small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A section on regional standards for HVAC equipment would authorize DOE to create a program that could lead to penalties and lawsuits aimed at the small businesses in every Congressional district that install and repair our air conditioners and heat pumps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The punishment would likely kick in if the repairman installs, the wrong air conditioner, e.g., a Georgia-rated air conditioner on the wrong side of the Florida state line. It would dictate efficiency levels by state or region without regard to price, size, or even energy savings payback.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision gives DOE authority to dictate energy efficiency standards for manufactured housing. HUD already has a successful program that is improving efficiency while keeping manufactured housing affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DOE's "price-is-no-object" track record on energy efficiency could mean that manufactured housing will no longer be affordable for the moderate income Americans who rely on it today. And jobs will be lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bad as the bill was that passed the House on August 4, this one is far worse. Vote "no", do not be tempted.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="CLOSING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the subject of the renewable portfolio standard, the gentleman from Texas and I are actually in bipartisan agreement. And while I strongly support the legislation before us and have urged and will urge the House to pass this bill because of the many improvements that it makes in national energy policy, I share the gentleman from Texas's concern about the renewable portfolio requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that there are places in the United States where the renewable resources are simply not found in sufficient quantity to meet that requirement. In the southeastern U.S., for example, there is a deficiency of both wind and solar potential, and these are the two renewable resources that are most prominently used across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The requirement that is before the House in this bill, frankly, is not broad enough in terms of the list of fuels that it makes eligible to meet the mandate. And there are States such as Pennsylvania that have made eligible a far broader range of fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this provision really does need more work, and it would be my preference that it's not here. But notwithstanding its presence, this is good legislation and the House should approve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
