  <narrative>FISA ADMENDMENTS ACT -- (Senate - July 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6646">S6646</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Congressional Record for July 9, 2008, inadvertently omitted my written statement for the Record. The text is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe that we must pass a new FISA bill that enables our intelligence community to get the information it needs to stop terrorist plots while also protecting our civil liberties, by requiring a court order before any American is targeted for eavesdropping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I don't believe in blanket immunity for the phone companies. That's why, in the Intelligence Committee, I offered language to deny immunity to the telecommunications companies for their alleged participation in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. But that amendment failed--and failed miserably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During floor consideration of the FISA bill, Senator Feinstein and I offered a compromise amendment that would have required the FISA court to review the actions of telecommunication companies who participated in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. But it failed too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I am backing an amendment by Senator Bingaman that would at least delay immunity until the inspectors general of the U.S. Government complete their investigation of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. Upon completion of the report, the Senate will have ninety days to act before immunity is granted to the telecommunications companies. This will allow us time to change some minds if real wrongdoing is found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I believe this legislation significantly improves civil liberties protections for Americans while enabling our intelligence community to listen in on terrorists. This is an important step forward and I will support this legislation.</paragraph>
