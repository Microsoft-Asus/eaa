    <paragraph>Mr. President, my thanks to the committee leaders for bringing forward the nominations to the Senate of Judge Greg Kays and Stephen Limbaugh to be Federal district court judges for the Western and Eastern District Courts of Missouri. Both Judge Kays and Judge Limbaugh are outstanding nominees for the Federal bench. They share bipartisan support, have fine legal minds, long records of public service, and represent the values and character of my Missouri constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both men's modesty matches the modest size of their Midwestern hometowns. But as we have seen so many times in our history, great men, men of learning, men of intellect and excellence, come from modest places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One should not doubt this to be the case. Values of fairness, service, kindness, community, learning, self-reliance, and personal responsibility are those that we value in our constituents, in our small-town communities, and we should value in our judges. I think this confirmation process has succeeded in producing two such men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, I thank my ranking member, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have spoken to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and to the Republican leader. We will enter a formal unanimous  consent for the Record at a subsequent time, but it appears at this time we will have a vote on one of the remaining two judges at 3:30, and the Judiciary Committee chair, Senator Leahy, has agreed we will not have to vote on the second one.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of an outstanding Virginian, the Honorable Mark S. Davis, who has been nominated by the President to serve as an article III judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. I am pleased to note that Judge Davis also enjoys the strong support of my colleague, Senator Webb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Davis has been nominated to fill the seat that was vacated by Judge T. S. Ellis, III, who has served as an active judge in the Eastern District of Virginia for more than 19 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege of knowing Mark Davis for more than two decades. He worked as an intern in my office while attending the University of Virginia, and then later, in 1984, he began his professional career as a staff assistant in my office before he went to law school. After earning his J. D. from the Washington &amp; Lee University School of Law in 1988, he served as a law clerk for the Honorable John MacKenzie on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subsequent to his clerkship, he entered private legal practice, as a litigation attorney on cases before both Federal and State courts in several areas, including tort, maritime, and municipal and employment law. In 2003, the Virginia General Assembly unanimously confirmed him to serve as a judge on the Third Judicial Circuit of Virginia in Portsmouth, VA; today, he serves as chief judge of this five-judge circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, Judge Davis is eminently qualified to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In addition to having the support of his home state Senators, he also received the highest recommendation of the Virginia State bar and the American Bar Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Judiciary Committee for favorably reporting this exemplary nominee to the full Senate, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today it is my distinct pleasure to offer my support along with my colleague Senator Warner for the nomination of Judge Mark Davis to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The career of this nominee is impressive. Judge Davis is regarded as a patient, thoughtful individual who exhibits the highest degree of ethical conduct and professionalism. After graduating law school, Judge Davis began his legal career as a law clerk to Judge John A. MacKenzie who served as judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, 1988-1989. In 1989, Judge Davis joined McGuire Woods, LLP, where he worked as a partner from 1996 until 1998. Judge Davis has also worked  as partner at Carr &amp; Porter LLC, 1998-2003. Since 2003, Judge Davis has served on the Third Judicial Circuit of Virginia, and has been the chief judge since 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Virginia Bar Association rated Judge Davis as "highly qualified." Judge Davis's written opinions reflect his keen intellect, and the extent to which he values communicating his reasoning to counsel and litigants. Further, Judge Davis is active in myriad community and civic organizations. Judge Davis received his B.A. in government from the University of Virginia in 1984, and his J.D. from Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution assigns a critically important role to the Senate in the advice and consent process related to  nominations for the Federal judiciary. These judgeships are lifetime appointments, and Virginians expect me and Senator Warner to take very seriously our constitutional duties. It is essential that the nominee be respectful of the Constitution, impartial, and balanced toward those appearing before him or her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of these criteria, Senator Warner and I undertook a careful and deliberative process to find the most qualified judicial nominees. Our collaboration involved a thorough records review and rigorous interviews. We are of the opinion that Judge Davis meets these high standards. He was on the joint list of recommended judicial nominees submitted to President Bush last year. We are pleased that President Bush has chosen to respect our diligent bipartisan work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to make these remarks about this outstanding Virginian. In particular, I want to express my gratitude for the expeditious way the Senate has moved the nomination of Judge Davis through the process during the 110th Congress. Again, it is with pride that I join Senator Warner in commending Judge Mark Davis to each of my colleagues in the Senate; and I ask my fellow Senators to vote to confirm his nomination to the U.S. District Court  for the Eastern District of Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to use the balance of my time to talk about the procedures on the Energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke yesterday about the problem created by the so-called procedure of filling the tree. It is my hope that we will return to the Energy bill and we will have an opportunity to offer amendments on the bill--the global warming bill, I should specify. Last week, I filed a series of amendments, and I hope we will return to the bill and will not have the procedure of filling the tree thwart the opportunity for Senators to offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I spoke at some length yesterday, we have devolved in this body into a procedure where the trademark of the Senate--that is, where a Senator is able to offer virtually any amendment on any matter at any time--has been undercut. This has been a practice which has been growing but was used not at all in bygone years. Senator Mitchell then used it 9 times, Senator Lott matched him with 9, Senator Frist matched him with 9, and Senator Reid has now used it 12 times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, when the tree is filled--an arcane practice not understood very broadly--and then cloture is not invoked, people think that Republicans are opposed to considering global warming. The fact is that some 32 Republicans voted for cloture on the motion to proceed. So it is my hope we will have an opportunity to debate this very important subject and that there will be procedural steps taken so amendments can be offered. The tradition of the Senate in the past has been to have legislation  offered, to debate, and if people are opposed, to filibuster, and to have the issues considered. But we have found in modern days that bills involving very important matters, such as the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Senate bill 1843, got very short shrift indeed. So it is my hope we will change the procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I filed a resolution with the Rules Committee in February of 2007 to have a change in the rules, but in the interim I hope we can alter our procedures to take up these very important amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there a sufficient second?</chair>
  <chair>There appears to be.</chair>
  <chair>The yeas and nays are ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Mr. LEAHY.</chair>
  <chair>Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm three more nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.</chair>
  <chair>The first nomination we consider is that of MARK DAVIS of Virginia to fill a vacancy in the Eastern District of Virginia, and I commend the Virginia Senators on this nomination. After years of controversial nominations, Senators WARNER and WEBB have worked successfully with the White House on a series of recent nominations for district and circuit court seats, including that of Judge G. Steven Agee of Virginia, who was confirmed to a seat on the Fourth Circuit last month.</chair>
  <chair>I was pleased to accommodate Senator Bond's request that we proceed promptly in committee to consider the nominations of David Kays and Stephen Limbaugh to vacancies in the Western and Eastern Districts of Missouri. Both nominees have the support of Senator McCaskill. I wish Justice Ronnie White, who went on to become Missouri's first African-American chief justice, had received similar consideration when President Clinton nominated him to the Eastern District of Missouri. Instead,  more than 2 years after he was nominated, and 2 1/2  months after he was reported out of the Judiciary Committee for a second time, his nomination was voted down on a party line vote, not a single Republican Senator voting to confirm him. I also recall many of President Clinton's judicial nominees who were stalled because of anonymous Republican objections to their politics or</chair>
  <chair>I noted last week the sudden concern of the minority leader for district court nominations. Perhaps he did not have a chance to see my statement from earlier in the week in which I noted that with Republican cooperation, we have the opportunity this work period confirm five nominees already reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee? Of course, today we would have more than those five nominations on the Senate's Executive Calendar had Republicans not stalled this President's nominations of  Judge Helene White and Ray Kethledge to the Sixth Circuit, and the nomination of Stephen Murphy to the Eastern District of Michigan. As I said last week, with cooperation from across the aisle, the Senate is poised to have confirmed four circuit court judges and 11 district court judges before the Fourth of July recess, confirming a total of 15 lifetime appointments.</chair>
  <chair>I recall Senator Specter's frustration when he was chairman with a Republican majority at the end of the last Congress, and Republican holds prevented the confirmation of 14 district court nominations. Democrats on the Judiciary Committee had worked hard to expedite the nominations at the end of the last Congress. Many of them were for vacancies deemed judicial emergencies, including three in one Federal district in Michigan where several judges of senior status--one over 90 years old--continued  to carry heavy caseloads to ensure that justice was administered in that district. Now, after the successful efforts of the Senators from Michigan in conjunction with the White House, I hope Republicans will not object to filling three more judicial emergency vacancies in Michigan.</chair>
  <chair>The complaints by the minority leader and his party about district court nominations ring as hollow as their complaints that Senate Democrats did not make best efforts to meet the goal he and the majority leader set of moving three circuit court nominations by Memorial Day. As at the end of the last Congress with those 14 district court nominations, Republicans resisted expediting the committee's consideration of the Michigan nominations before Memorial Day. They badgered the nominees, and sent  scores of written follow up questions. At the May 7 hearing, the Republicans chose to complain that the committee was moving too fast, before the committee had received updated ABA ratings on the nominations. They pressed Judge White with scores of questions, failing to pose those same questions to Mr. Kethledge, a candidate for the same circuit. They demanded</chair>
  <chair>We have now received the updated ABA rating for Judge White's nomination. She received a well qualified rating. That did not come as any surprise. She has served ably on the Michigan state appellate courts and acquired additional experience in the decade since she was nominated by President Clinton and the Republican Senate majority refused to consider her nomination.</chair>
  <chair>Ultimately, the Republican-led Senate left open five vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and four on the Sixth Circuit. With the Agee confirmation last month, we have already reduced vacancies on the Fourth Circuit to less than there were at the end of the Clinton administration, when a Republican-controlled Senate had refused to consider any nominees to that circuit during the last 2 years of the Clinton Presidency. If Republicans cooperate in considering the Michigan nominees, we will have filled  every vacancy in the Sixth Circuit. Overall, when Republicans ran the Senate and were stalling consideration of President Clinton's nominees, circuit vacancies rose from 11 to 26, and it reached 32 during the transition to President Bush. We are in position to reduce circuit vacancies by three-quarters, to an historic low.</chair>
  <chair>In contrast to the Republican Senate majority that used the Clinton years to more than double circuit court vacancies around the country, the Senate has already reduced circuit court vacancies by almost two-thirds, We are poised to complete Senate consideration of the two Sixth Circuit nominations. If the Republican minority allows that progress, yet another circuit will be without any vacancies. In fact, we would reduce the total number of circuit court vacancies across the Nation to single  digits for the first time in decades.</chair>
  <chair>If instead we focus on the controversial nominations as the Republicans want, we run the risk of embroiling the committee and the Senate in months of debate, foreclosing the opportunity to make progress where we can. We saw what happened with our last contentious nomination--that of Leslie Southwick. It took 5 1/2  months from the time of the hearing to his confirmation.</chair>
  <chair>The minority leader and the Wall Street Journal continue to point to the confirmation of 15 circuit judges in 1999 and 2000. Sometimes, the number is 17. Of course, their mythical "statistical average" of selected years ignores the crises the Republicans had created by not considering circuit nominees in 1996, 1997 and 1998, the fact that they refused to confirm a single circuit nominee during the entire 1996 session, the fact that they returned 17 circuit court nominees without action to the  White House in 2000, the public criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist that helped moderate their stalling and the fact that they more than doubled circuit court vacancies while pocket filibustering Clinton nominees.</chair>
  <chair>The minority leader only reaches this mythical statistical by taking advantage of the high confirmation numbers of Democratic-led Senates confirming the nominees of President Reagan and the first President Bush. They ignore their own record of doubling vacancies during the Clinton administration. They do not like to recall that during the 1996 session, when a Republican majority controlled the Senate during a Presidential election year, they refused to confirm any circuit court judges at all--not  one. Their practice of pocket filibustering President Clinton's judicial nominees led Chief Justice Rehnquist, hardly a Democratic partisan, to criticize them publicly. Even he was appalled by the actions of the Republican Senate majority. In his 1996 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, he wrote:</chair>
  <chair>Because the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the vacancy rate is beginning to climb. When the 104th Congress adjourned in 1996, 17 new judges had been appointed and 28 nominations had not been acted upon. Fortunately, a dependable corps of senior judges contributes significantly to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships. It is hoped that the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies  is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.</chair>
  <chair>When that shot across the bow did not lead the Republican Senate majority to reverse course, Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke up, again, in his 1997 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary. It was a salvo from a Republican Chief Justice critical of the Republican Senate leadership:</chair>
  <chair>Currently, 82 of the 846 Article III judicial offices in the Federal Judiciary--almost one out of every ten--are vacant. Twenty-six of the vacancies have been in existence for 18 months or longer and on that basis constitute what are called "judicial emergencies." In the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the percentage of vacancies is particularly troubling, with over one-third of its seats empty.</chair>
  <chair>Judicial vacancies can contribute to a backlog of cases, undue delays in civil cases, and stopgap measures to shift judicial personnel where they are most needed. Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the Federal Judiciary. Fortunately for the Judiciary, a dependable corps of senior judges has contributed significantly to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships.</chair>
  <chair>It was only after the scorching criticism by a Republican Chief Justice that the Republican Senate majority modified its approach in order to allow some of the nominations that had been held back for years to finally proceed. Having built up scores of vacancies, some were allowed to be filled while the Republican Senate majority carefully kept vacant circuit court positions to be filled by President Clinton's successor. It is in that context that Republican claims of magnanimity must be seen  for what it was. It is in that context that the eight circuit confirmations in 2000 must be evaluated while the Republican Senate majority returned 17 circuit nominations to President Clinton at the end of that session without action.</chair>
  <chair>In stark contrast, the Democratic Senate majority has worked steadily and steadfastly to lower vacancies and make progress, and we have.</chair>
  <chair>I have placed the two Michigan Sixth Circuit nominations on the agenda for the committee's business meeting this week. With cooperation from the Republicans, we can consider and vote on these nominations at that time. That should provide the Senate with the opportunity to consider them before the Fourth of July recess, bringing to four the number of circuit court nominees confirmed this year. Four would meet the Republican average for 1996 and 2000, and beat their total in the 1996 session by  four.</chair>
  <chair>The history is clear. On June 1, 2000, when a Republican Senate majority was considering the judicial nominees of a Democratic President in a Presidential election year, there were 66 judicial vacancies. Twenty were circuit court vacancies, and 46 were district court vacancies. Those vacancies were the result of years of Republican pocket filibusters of judicial nominations. This year, by comparison there are just 47 total vacancies with only 11 circuit vacancies and 36 district court vacancies.  After today, there will be just 44 total vacancies. If we can continue to make progress this month, the current vacancies could be reduced to fewer than 40, with only 9 circuit court vacancies and 30 district court vacancies.</chair>
  <chair>When Republicans were busy pocket filibustering Clinton nominees, Federal judicial vacancies grew to more than 100, with more than 30 circuit vacancies.</chair>
  <chair>When I became Chairman in the summer of 2001, we quickly--and dramatically--lowered vacancies. The 100 nominations we confirmed in only 17 months, while working with a most uncooperative White House, reduced vacancies by 45 percent.</chair>
  <chair>After the four intervening years of a Republican Senate majority, vacancies remained about level.</chair>
  <chair>It is the Democratic Senate majority that has again worked hard to lower them in this Congress. We have gone from more than 110 vacancies to less than 50 and are heading to less than 40. With respect to Federal circuit court vacancies, we have reversed course from the days during which the Republican Senate majority more than doubled circuit vacancies. It bears repeating--circuit vacancies have been reduced by almost two-thirds and have not been this low since 1996, when the Republican tactics  to slow judicial confirmations began in earnest.</chair>
  <chair>Consider for a moment the numbers: After another productive month, just 9 of the 178 authorized circuit court judgeships will remain vacant--just 9--a vacancy rate down from 18 percent to just 5 percent. With 168 active appellate judges and 104 senior status judges serving on the Federal Courts of Appeals, there are 272 circuit court judges. I expect that is the most in our history.</chair>
  <chair>The President has not nominated anyone to 16 of the current judicial vacancies. He has refused since 2004 to work with the California Senators on a successor to Judge Trott on the Ninth Circuit. The district court vacancies without nominees span from those that arose in Mississippi and Michigan in 2006, to several from 2007 in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana and the District of Columbia, to others that arose earlier this year in Kansas, Virginia, Washington, and several in Colorado and Pennsylvania.</chair>
  <chair>Disputes over a handful of controversial judicial nominations have wasted valuable time that could be spent on the real priorities of every American. I have sought, instead, to make progress where we can. The result is the significant reduction in judicial vacancies.</chair>
  <chair>In fact, our work has led to a reduction in vacancies in nearly ever circuit. Both the Second and Fifth Circuits had circuit-wide emergencies due to the multiple simultaneous vacancies during the Clinton years with Republicans in control of the Senate. Both the Second Circuit and the Fifth Circuit now are without a single vacancy. We have already succeeded in lowering vacancies in the Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit,  the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the DC Circuit, and the Federal Circuit. Circuits with no current vacancies include the Seventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit and the Federal Circuit. When we are allowed to proceed with President Bush's nominations of Judge White and Ray Kethledge to the Sixth Circuit, it will join that list of Federal circuits without a single vacancy.</chair>
  <chair>My approach has been consistent throughout my chairmanships during the Bush Presidency. The results have been positive. Last year, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported 40 judicial nominations to the Senate and all 40 were confirmed. That was more than had been confirmed in any of the three preceding years when a Republican chairman and Republican Senate majority managed the process.</chair>
  <chair>Despite this progress, of course, some partisans seem determined to provoke an election year fight over nominations. The press accounts are filled with threats of Republican reprisals. The May 14 issue of Roll Call boasted the following headline: "GOP Itching for Fight Over Judges; Reid's Pledge to Move Three Before Recess Fails to Appease Minority." Then in a recent article in The Washington Times, we read that the Republican fixation on judges is part of an effort to bolster Senator McCain's  standing among conservatives. There seem to be no steps we could take to satisfy Senate Republicans on nominations, because they are using it as a partisan issue to rev up their partisan political base.</chair>
  <chair>The Republican effort to create an issue over judicial confirmations is sorely misplaced. Last month we experienced the greatest rise in unemployment in a single month in over two decades, bringing the total job losses for the first 5 consecutive months of this year to over 325,000. Americans are now facing increasing burdens from the soaring price of gas, high food prices, rising unemployment and a home mortgage foreclosure and credit crisis.</chair>
  <chair>This year we have seen the worst plunge in new homes sales in two decades. The press reported that new home sales fell 8.5 percent in March, the slowest sales pace since October 1991, and the median price of a home sold dropped 13.3 percent compared to the previous year. That was the biggest year-over-year price decline in four decades. You would have to go back to July 1970 to find a larger decline.</chair>
  <chair>Unfortunately, this bad economic news for hard-working Americans is nothing new under the Bush administration. During the Bush administration, unemployment is up more than 20 percent and trillions of dollars in budget surplus have been turned into trillions of dollars of debt, with an annual budget deficit of hundreds of millions of dollars. Last week, the price of oil soared to nearly $139 a barrel, nearly twice what it was at this time last year. When President Bush took office, the price of  gas was $1.42 a gallon. Today, it is at an all-time high of over $4.00 a gallon.</chair>
  <chair>According to a recent poll, 81 percent of Americans today believe that our country is headed in the wrong direction. It costs more than $1 billion a day--$1 billion a day--just to pay down the interest on the national debt and the massive costs generated by the disastrous war in Iraq. That's $365 billion this year that would be better spent on priorities like health care for all Americans, better schools, fighting crime, and treating diseases at home and abroad.</chair>
  <chair>In contrast, one of the few numbers actually going down as the President winds down his tenure is that of judicial vacancies. Senate Democrats have worked hard to make progress on judicial nominations, lowering circuit court vacancies by almost two-thirds from the level to which the Republican Senate majority had built them. Any effort to turn attention from the real issues facing Americans to win political points with judicial nominations is neither prudent, nor productive.</chair>
  <chair>Today we confirm three nominations for lifetime appointments. The first, Mark S. Davis, currently serves as Chief Judge of the Portsmouth Circuit Court, Third Judicial Circuit of Virginia. Prior to his appointment to the bench in 2003, Judge Davis worked in private practice at several Virginia law firms.</chair>
  <chair>David Gregory Kays currently serves as the presiding circuit court judge for the Twenty-Sixth Judicial Circuit for the State of Missouri, where he has served since his first election in 2005. Previously, Judge Kays served as an associate circuit judge for Laclede County Circuit Court in Missouri and as chief assistant prosecuting attorney in Laclede County.</chair>
  <chair>Stephen N. Limbaugh is a supreme court judge and former chief justice on the Supreme Court of Missouri. Previously, Judge Limbaugh was appointed and then elected Circuit Judge for the 32nd Judicial Circuit of Missouri. Before his career on the State bench, Judge Limbaugh was an elected prosecuting attorney and also worked in private practice.</chair>
  <chair>So today we make progress, and the Senate is likely to confirm three additional lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmation today.</chair>
  <chair>Mr. President, how much time remains on either side?</chair>
  <chair> Two minutes twenty seconds for the Senator from Virginia, and 33 seconds to the Senator from Pennsylvania.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Pennsylvania.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield 1 minute to the Senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was very privileged to submit the name of Mr. Davis to the President of the United States, and I am greatly appreciative to the Senate to now come to the question of his confirmation. But I think it would be interesting if I were to point out to all those following it that this individual was a former member of my staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it shows the incentive of those many staff persons all throughout our system who contribute so much to the work of our individual Senators that they too can, through their service, lay the foundation to someday achieve this recognition by the Senate in which they worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I very quickly wish to associate myself with the remarks of the senior Senator from Virginia and to emphasize that we jointly examined a whole array of nominees for this position. This individual, perhaps because of and perhaps in spite of the fact he worked for the senior Senator from Virginia, is considered highly qualified by Members on this side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Vermont.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would commend one more time the two Senators from Virginia, both dear friends of mine, for the fact we worked as one  Democrat, one Republican with the White House to get us past this impasse. And I commend President Bush for withdrawing controversial nominees and working toward consensus nominees. That is why this nominee will go through, I suspect unanimously, in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend the two Senators from Missouri, Senators BOND and MCCASKILL, for working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has all time been yielded back?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Yes, it has.</chair>
  <chair>The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Mark Steven Davis, of Virginia, to be a United States district judge for the Eastern District of Virginia?</chair>
  <narrative>The clerk will call the roll.</narrative>
