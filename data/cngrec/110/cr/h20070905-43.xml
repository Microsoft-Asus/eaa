  <narrative>IN MEMORY OF THE LATE HONORABLE CHARLES VANIK -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10112]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to inform the House that in addition to the loss of Ohio's beloved colleague PAUL GILLMOR today and former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn, we have lost a beloved friend and indefatigable colleague when Ohio Congressman Charles Vanik passed away last week at the age of 94.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that Congressman Regula and I, along with all of our delegation, feel this loss as deeply as we feel the others. I wanted to just mention to our colleagues that Congressman Vanik served from 1955 until 1981 and was affectionately known as Ohio's third Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is probably most remembered for his landmark legislation, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, that continues to connect U.S. trade policy to human rights. We in Ohio will always remember him as a true champion and leader on Medicare, Social Security and the plight of the poorest Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to yield to my colleague, my beloved friend, Ralph Regula, now for some words.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I also would like to mention the loss of Charlie Vanik. I think for the people of Ohio, his greatest legacy is he joined John Seiberling and myself in creating the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and it was his leadership that was vital in getting that legislation passed. Millions of Ohioans and others enjoy the great outdoors in this 33,000-acre park that serves our State so well, and that was a wonderful legacy that Charlie Vanik left as part  of his service in this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. We will never forget his good humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just ask for 10 seconds to say to my colleagues in terms of my neighbor, PAUL GILLMOR, with whom I served over 20 years in this body, we just happened to be flying over Ohio this past week to assess the flood damage in his district. My last memory of him is actually climbing out of the Apache helicopter we were both in. There were just the two of us with the Ohio National Guard, and he extended his hand to me to help me get out of the helicopter after a very long day in many communities,  including Bucyrus and Findlay. I have many memories, but I shall never forget that. He was a gentleman of this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues very much.</paragraph>
