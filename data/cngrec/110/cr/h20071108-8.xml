  <narrative>WAR DESTRUCTIVE OF NATIONAL AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13301]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Defense bill contained a request for millions of dollars to retrofit B-2 Stealth bombers so they can carry 30,000-pound bombs, bunker busters, which would be germane to the administration's intention of attacking Iran. Imagine for a moment 30,000-pound bombs dropped on nuclear research labs in Natanz and in Bushehr, and you have a humanitarian and ecological disaster on your hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the case for war against Iran is being built on lies, just as the case for war against Iraq was built on lies. Nearly 4,000 troops dead; nearly a million innocent Iraqis perished in the conflict; borrowing money from China to fight a war against Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to impeach this Vice President for leading this country into a war that is so destructive of our national agenda. It is time for us to reclaim our Constitution and to reclaim the troops.</paragraph>
