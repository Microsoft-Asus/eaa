    <paragraph>Mr. President, I express my gratitude and thanks to Richard M. Shapiro for his many years of service to the Members and staff of the Congress. I and other Members honor him for his dedication to this great institution, his tireless work on its behalf, and the countless ways in which he has helped us serve the public over nearly three decades, including almost two decades as executive director of the Congressional Management Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shapiro began his impressive career in 1978 here in the Senate, when he was a staff investigator at the former Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. After receiving a master's degree in public policy from Princeton University, Mr. Shapiro returned to Congress as the staff director for the former House Post Office and Civil Service Subcommittee on Investigations and later became staff director at the House Small Business Subcommittee on Regulations and Business Opportunities. In those  positions, he continued to learn Congress inside and out, especially the importance of good management in the formation of effective teams and the unique challenges facing managers in Congress. This experience led him to become deputy executive director of the Congressional Management Foundation in 1988, and just 1 year later he became executive director.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his years at CMF, Rick has undertaken numerous strategies with just one goal--helping Congress do the public's business more efficiently and effectively. His efforts as a management consultant have involved countless office retreats, staff surveys, individual assessments, and strategic planning sessions. Rick has also delivered dozens of training programs to address the needs of legislative and support staff. He has also authored and coauthored several books including the biannual "House  and Senate Staff Salary Survey, Frontline Management, and Setting Course; A Congressional Management Guide" which has proved to be an invaluable guide for hundreds of new Members as they arrive in Congress. Rick has also undertaken a wide  range of activities to help Congress effectively move into the Digital Age, including recommendations on Web site design and managing Internet communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can speak directly to the terrific work that Rick has done over the years because for more than a decade he has played a critical role in helping me and my staff manage the challenges and take advantage of opportunities we have in representing the people of Wisconsin here in the Senate. That assistance has taken a wide variety of forms, ranging from multiday all-staff retreats, to staff surveys and analysis, to individual staff assessment and advice. He has helped us design annual evaluations,  improve our salary and bonus structure, design our Web site, improve our mail system, and--perhaps most importantly--step back and assess our environment regularly to be sure we are doing our best for the people of Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick's efforts on behalf of our office reflect the amazing dedication and commitment that he has brought to every task over the years. There is never any question too small--or any hour too late--for him to make himself available to offer advice. His thoughtful analysis has been critical to many decisions I have made over the years, and I am grateful for his assistance at many key junctures in my career. I know that my office operates much more efficiently and effectively today thanks to his  advice over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his work with my office, I would also like to honor Rick for his dedication in continuing and dramatically expanding the work of CMF. Nonprofit organizations are a bit like restaurants--many of them open every year, but few of them last. Ultimately, those that survive do so as a result of the tireless dedication of a very small group of people, and in the case of CMF, Rick has helped them not only survive but to thrive and grow. During his tenure, the budget for CMF has more than quadrulpled,  while the staff has doubled and the work done for Congress has grown exponentially. As I mentioned earlier, Rick and CMF have undertaken a wide range of activities on behalf of Congress. Ultimately, Rick and CMF have a "whatever it takes" attitude, and we in Congress have been the beneficiaries of that intensity, creativity, and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I would like to honor Rick for his tireless dedication to assisting Senators, Congressmen, staff, and the entire institution of the Congress in our efforts to better serve the American people. We are grateful for all of his hard work over the years, and we look forward to working with him again in the future.</paragraph>
