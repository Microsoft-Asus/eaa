    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this evening I will continue my discussion on a growing and often deadly plague on our society, witness intimidation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each day, there is a story reported about civic-minded citizens being threatened with violence or becoming victims of fire bombings or shootings, all of which are designed to prevent them from testifying to crimes that they have witnessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, these tactics are working to form what has become commonly known as a "conspiracy of silence." Witnesses are literally afraid for their lives. If you do not believe me, listen to these recent reports: in Newark, New Jersey, for 2 years Reginald Roe was the star and sole witness that prosecutors were relying on in a case involving an ambush gang killing in a parking lot there. Having picked two men's pictures out of a photo array and sworn before a grand jury, he said: "I saw  everything, I was there."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when the case came to trial, with a group of gang members glaring at him in open court, Roe changed his story, testifying that he had heard the shots, but never saw who fired them. The two suspects were acquitted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Philadelphia, as the culture of fear continues to deter witnesses from coming forward, a Federal grand jury accused a drug dealer and his girlfriend of conspiring to intimidate a government witness by having the witness's neighborhood plastered with flyers labeling him "a rat and a snitch."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Parachute, Colorado, Garfield County deputies arrested five teenagers they believed threatened to beat someone with a baseball bat who planned to testify against them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my hometown of Baltimore, a 16-year-old witness in the case of the murder of 15-year-old Christine Richardson was moved from the city by relatives due to mounting threats. Indeed, the teenager was beaten the day after the murder occurred and was threatened by three girls, one of whom brandished a gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the current situation is simply unacceptable. We should be making it easier for witnesses of crime to come forward. It should be the norm, rather than an odd occurrence, for criminals to be prosecuted. This issue must be addressed because without witnesses, there can be no justice in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some success stories do exist. On August 31, Baltimore City State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy was able to get a witness to testify, which helped secure the conviction of 39-year-old Joseph Brinkley on two counts of attempted first-degree murder and handgun charges. In November of 2005, Brinkley approached two men as they hailed a cab and shot them in the back multiple times with a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The victim originally told detectives that he did not see the shooter, but recanted  his statement after Brinkley approach him and his 9-year-old son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, such bravery is rare. Our constituents must know that taking an interest in their community and reporting crime is the right thing to do and that the government will do everything possible to ensure their safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I urge my colleagues to become a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="933">H.R. 933</bill>, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007, and to support its passage when it comes to the House floor. Upon enactment, this legislation authorizes $90 million a year over the next 3 years to assist State and local law enforcement for witness protection while fostering Federal, State, and local partnerships. Priority will be given to prosecuting offices in States with an average of at least 100 murders during the immediate  past 5 years; however, smaller entities also have a chance to receive funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State and local prosecutors will also be able to use these funds to provide witness protection on their own or to pay the cost of enrolling their witnesses in the short-term State witness protection program to be created within the U.S. Marshal Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, finally, improving protection for State and local witnesses will move us one step closer toward alleviating the fears of and threats to prospective witnesses and help to safe guard our communities from violence</paragraph>
