  <chair> The clerk will report the bill by title.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="s" number="2271">S. 2271</bill>) to authorize State and local governments to divest access in companies that conduct business operations in Sudan, to prohibit United States Government contracts with such companies, and for other purposes.</chair>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.</narrative>
  <narrative>(At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to speak about the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007. This bill was approved unanimously by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and I am pleased to report that, in the same bipartisan spirit, it will soon be approved by the full Senate. I am indebted to Ranking Member Shelby for his tremendous collaboration on this important measure. And I want to recognize Senator Durbin, as well--few have been stronger leaders  of the divestment effort, or fiercer advocates for the people of Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is aimed at ending the Darfur genocide. I strongly believe that it is our responsibility to help bring that end about--not simply because genocide, everywhere and always, imposes a grave moral obligation on those with the power to stop it, but because many of us share responsibility for this genocide in a much more concrete way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider this hypothetical: One of our 50 States invests its employees' pension funds in a wide range of stocks. Some of those dollars end up supplying capital to a multinational corporation, one of whose subsidiaries operates in Sudan--mining, say, for copper or gold. That firm pays the Sudanese government for mining rights, and in the fullness of time, money that began in America finds its way into the blood-stained coffers of Omar al-Bashir. What could those dollars become at last? A plane  dropping fire on a Darfuri village; a knife held to a woman's throat; weapons of murder and rape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a chain of cause and effect in which American money may finally objectively fund genocide--in which Americans may come to pay, through no fault or intention of their own, for crimes they abhor. If responsibility means anything, it exists at every step of that chain. To be sure, it grows heavier at each step; but just as it is certain at the last step, it is present at the first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why those who have recognized their place in that chain and who have resolved to break it deserve our blessing and our support. Twenty-one states have begun to divest from Sudan, and similar work is underway in about 20 more. At least 55 colleges and universities have divested, and efforts are underway at about 50 more. Many large cities, non-profits, and pension and mutual funds have joined this campaign--a campaign that recognizes that our responsibility for Darfur can go beyond speaking  out, to actively depriving the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militia of some of their means of murder. Along with sanctions, Security Council resolutions, and a combined UN/African Union force, divestment is part of a global movement to cut off funding and end, at long last, the Darfur genocide. Even if it succeeds, it will have come more than 450,000 lives too late; but lost time and lost lives should only fire our urgency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Accountability and Divestment Act is Congress's latest step to aid this global movement. It helps Americans  to divest from firms whose business props up the Sudanese regime, it gives them the tools to make socially responsible investment decisions, and it ensures that investors who choose to divest will be held harmless for those decisions. The bill has five key provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it explicitly authorizes states and localities to divest from companies involved in those economic sectors that, by its own admission, are Khartoum's main sources of foreign investment--petroleum, mining, and power production--along with military production. Investment in these sectors, more than any others, is propping up the Bashir regime and enabling its intransigence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The divestment standards set by this bill are universal. It allows divestment to take place in a unitary, federally sanctioned manner. That alone should contradict the claim that this bill somehow violates the Constitution's Supremacy Clause by establishing "50 different foreign policies." Moreover, state divestment could hardly be considered unconstitutional when it is explicitly authorized on the federal level. Paul H. Schwartz, legal counsel to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, and former  clerk to two Supreme Court Justices, made the case convincingly:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only logical that when a bill authorizing state measures touching on foreign affairs becomes federal law, the federal government has expressed a judgment that the measures do not "intrude" into or "interfere" with federal foreign policy, but rather complement that policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is exactly what this legislation does. It outlines a targeted, federal divestment policy and authorizes states and investors to act consistently with that policy if they so choose. In doing so, the bill protects the investors' right to be guided by conscience; it also allows investors to protect themselves from the financial and reputational risks posed by an affiliation with Khartoum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this bill allows mutual fund and corporate pension fund managers to cut ties, at their discretion, with companies involved in the 4 key sectors. It also offers limited protection from lawsuits for those choosing to divest, while preserving their normal fiduciary duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it establishes the sense of Congress that private pension managers are already authorized to divest their public pension funds from businesses in the 4 sectors, in accordance with existing Department of Labor regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, it requires federal contractors to certify that they do not do business with firms involved in the 4 sectors, and it provides several punitive options, including debarment, if those contractors are found to be lying. The bill does, however, authorize the President to grant contractors a waiver if their operations in Sudan are found to be in the national interest; and it adds an extra level of accountability by mandating that the President report these exceptions to Congress on a case-by-case  basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am aware that some have argued for an additional waiver on the basis of "substantial humanitarian work" in Sudan, but I believe that that criterion would fit within any conception of the national interest, properly understood. In the end, the exposure  mandated by the president's case-by-case reports to Congress will be the best deterrent to firms that seek waivers on spurious grounds: They will be exposed to the whole nation and forced to justify their actions to a highly skeptical public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, the bill's authorities terminate when the government of Sudan ends its murderous policies and returns to the community of law-abiding nations. The divestment campaign will end when, and only when, Sudan fully accepts the presence of the joint UN/AU peacekeeping force, ceases attacks on civilians, demilitarizes the Janjaweed militia, allows the unfettered delivery of humanitarian relief, and grants the right of return to refugees. Anything short of those targets, divestment must and will  continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The international divestment campaign exists precisely to pressure Khartoum to meet those goals. It is stunning, Mr. President, that pressure should even be needed to force a sovereign nation to end targeted attacks on civilians. Yet that is the case; that is the radical evil we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even still, some in this administration are urging us to treat Khartoum with kid gloves at this delicate time for peace negotiations, as the Justice Department put it in a letter 2 months ago. That would be the same administration whose Special Envoy to Sudan declared American action on the genocide imminent 11 months ago. That would be the same administration whose president declared the crimes in Darfur "genocide" more than two years ago, and has done next to nothing of substance since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, one of those few substantive actions has been to endorse a bill that originated in the Senate, the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act, which strengthened penalties on companies violating U.S. sanctions. That bill was approved unanimously by the Senate Banking Committee and adopted unanimously by this Congress. That bill, like this one, targets the Khartoum regime's financial supports; that bill, like this one, comes at a "delicate time" for negotiations. As  my colleague Senator Menendez asked an official of the State Department at a recent hearing of the Senate Banking Committee:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the difference? You have a sanctions regime that you are all enthusiastically pursuing before the peace conference in Tripoli, and yet you are back-pedaling on this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Honestly, I can't see my way through the contradiction. If the administration endorsed tough measures then, it should do the same now, and if it wants to shirk our responsibility altogether, it should tell us why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, as the Administration has stalled and insisted that we refrain from approving this critical legislation, talks have broken down. The Tripoli conference that the State Department had been heralding as a great breakthrough at the Banking Committee's October 3rd hearing ended up being canceled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is that economic pressure has seemed to be the only tool that's proven successful in bringing Khartoum back to the table in the first place. That truth is in keeping with everything the regime has shown us in its 18 years of existence. As John Prendergast, Co-Chair of the ENOUGH Project and former National Security Council and State Department Official, told the Banking Committee during our hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four times in 18 years, we have been able to change the policies of the Government of Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the mid-1990s, Khartoum renounced its support for international terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda. Why? International pressure and multilateral sanctions from the United States, its allies, and the Security Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the same decade, Sudan ended its support of the slave trade. Why? Again, multilateral sanctions led by the Security Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the government signed a peace deal with rebels, ending a civil war that had taken 2 million lives. Why? In large part, because of a coordinated divestment campaign and Congress's passage of the Sudan Peace Act, which condemned the government's human rights record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this year, the government acquiesced in the UN/AU peacekeeping force. Why? Largely because of economic pressure from China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four times, the international community has brought some measure of control to Khartoum's criminal behavior, and there is one common thread: sustained pressure. As Prendergast put it, the only way to end the genocide is if "multilateral, targeted pressures are increased." Conversely, "the deadly mistake that has been made for Darfur repeatedly during the last 4 1/2  years is to do precisely as the administration proposes now to reduce pressure, to let up."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After all, it makes perfect sense. What do we expect from those capable of presiding over all this blood? What do we expect from killers who, in the words of one survivor, "are happy when they rape they sing when they rape"?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do we expect them to listen politely to our objections? Do we expect to change their minds?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. All of our prayers, no matter how fervent, and all of our words, no matter how eloquent, are only noise to them. They do not speak the language of should or ought. They speak the language of must. To the genocidal killers and their sponsors, this bill is one more word in the only language they know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And given everything we have learned from history and from simple common sense, all the talk of kid gloves would be hysterical--if it weren't infuriating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if some in this administration haven't learned the lesson, I have learned it in my bones. In 1945, my father, Tom Dodd, was called to Nuremberg, Germany, to help lead the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. He wrote my mother that few things were more painful than being away from his family. I learned to walk and talk in his absence. But he also wrote home: "I will never do anything as worthwhile."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What, today, could be more worthwhile? What could be clearer than the duty we owe to the 2.5 million displaced, the orphaned, the raped, the dead themselves? Even if they cannot fathom the chain linking us to the fire falling on their villages, or the knives against their throats, we can; we can see it and choose to break it. Even if we bear only the smallest fraction of responsibility, we can choose to act as if we bore all of it. Measure by measure and step by step and inch by inch, we can  choose to push with all our strength against death's machinery until it cracks at last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another step. I ask my colleagues to take it with me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have regularly come to the Senate floor to speak about the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 4 long years, the world has watched this tragedy the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, the torching of entire villages, rape, torture, and untold human suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 3 years have passed since the UN Commission of Inquiry concluded that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed in Darfur and may be no less serious and heinous than genocide. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us on both sides of the aisle and in the international community have repeatedly called for greater U.S. and global action to stem the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon have all called for greater action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this week, a group calling itself the Elders including several Nobel Peace Prize Winners and former heads of state spoke forcefully for action in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these efforts, the Sudanese government has continued to show its contempt for its own people and the demands of the global community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message was loud and clear earlier this year when the UN Security Council voted to deploy a 26,000 member peacekeeping force to Darfur. This hybrid UN-African Union force will help stem the violence and create an atmosphere in which peace talks can move toward a long-term political agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the peacekeepers set to begin deployment on January 1, we are once again witnessing the same old pattern from Khartoum. The Sudanese government is now denying deployment of non-African peacekeepers, despite their acceptance of this new force only a few months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have waited long enough for this murderous government to take action, to stop slaughtering its own people, to stop thumbing its nose at the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I commend the Senate for its action today to encourage cooperation by the Sudanese government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I introduced 2 bills that would have increased economic pressure on the Sudanese regime. Each bill supported state and local divestment efforts, allowing each of us to do our part to end the madness in Darfur by selling investments that help prop up the Sudanese regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that Senator Dodd, as chairman of the Banking Committee, has adopted ideas from these bills into the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007. I thank him, as well as Ranking Member Shelby and others who have worked on this bill especially Senators CORNYN and BROWNBACK, who joined me as lead sponsors of the legislation I had introduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this critically-important legislation, and I look forward to working with the House to send it to the President for his signature as soon as possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud that the Senate will have taken strong action tonight to help stop the genocide in Darfur. I would like to commend Senator DODD for his hard work to get the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 passed. I would also like to congratulate Senator DURBIN who was the lead cosponsor of the first legislation on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill, the Senate is saying clearly to the government of Sudan that the American people do not want to fund genocide. We already have a wide range of sanctions against Sudan, but this bill closed an important loophole by targeting pension plans. The legislation would make sure that the money we put away each month for our retirement does not go to fund companies which support the genocidal regime in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has already passed similar legislation with an overwhelming, and bipartisan, vote of 418-1. With Senate passage, we will hopefully be able to move quickly to turn this bill into the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we pass this legislation the crisis in Darfur continues, with nearly 2 million people displaced and an estimated 450,000 people killed. The real hope for the people of Darfur is a strong UN-AU peacekeeping force. But President Bashir is once again keeping that force from moving forward, putting a man indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes on the committee overseeing these peacekeepers. He also continues to put other roadblocks in front of the peacekeepers, who should be  in place and operating by January 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation sends a loud and a clear message to the Sudanese regime that they must stop standing in the way of full implementation of the AU-UN peacekeepers. I hope that President Bashir is listening and that we will see that AU-UN force operational by January 1 of next year. The U.S. Senate will be watching, the United Nations will be watching, and the eyes of the world are on President Bashir. We all have a moral obligation to end the genocide, stop the violence, and relieve the suffering  of the people of Darfur.</paragraph>
