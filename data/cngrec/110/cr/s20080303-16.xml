    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today because it is the 172nd anniversary of Texas Independence Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to take a moment to read a letter that is such an important part of the history of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the letter of William Barrett Travis from the Alamo. This is a tradition I have continued that was started by my colleague and friend, Senator John Tower, to commemorate Texas Independence Day every year, which is March 2. Now, of course, March 2 was yesterday, which is Sunday, so I always try to do it as close to March 2 as I can, as Senator Tower did when he was serving in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Texas Declaration of Independence was a document that was signed by, among others, my own great, great grandfather, Charles S. Taylor, as well as his great friend, Thomas Rusk, who became one of the first two Senators from Texas and whose seat I hold today. They both hailed from Nacogdoches, which is the oldest town in Texas. It is the town where my mother grew up and where my great, great grandfather was a delegate to the convention that declared independence from Mexico for the territory  that was Texas. It is a historic time for Texas. We celebrate Texas Independence Day every single year because we know fighting for freedom has made a difference in what Texas is. We love our history. We fought for freedom and we were a republic, an independent nation for 10 years. Then, we came into the United States under a treaty as a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The defense of the Alamo by 189 courageous men, who were outnumbered 10 to 1, was a key battle in the Texas revolution. The sacrifice of COL William Barrett Travis and his men made possible GEN Sam Houston's ultimate victory at San Jacinto, which secured independence for Texas. That is where Santa Anna, the general in charge of the Mexican Army, formally surrendered and that was end of the fight for Texas independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Travis wrote to his countrymen a letter asking for reinforcements:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion; otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the sword if the fort is taken. I have answered the demands with a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly from the wall. I shall never surrender or retreat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism and of everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to 3,000 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country--victory or death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William Barrett Travis, LT. COL. Commander.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the letter he wrote from the Alamo. He did not get reinforcements. Those brave 189 men did, in fact, fight against what is estimated to be 4,000 or 5,000 Mexican soldiers, but they held long enough for GEN Sam Houston to muster his strength and add to his Army. Then, about a month later, in April, the San Jacinto battle did take place against the Mexican Army and Santa Anna surrendered. So it was an important part in Texas history which we value and celebrate very thoroughly every March  2nd. I will continue the tradition of Senator Tower as long as I am in the Senate, and I hope it can continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
