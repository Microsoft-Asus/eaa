  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while we are in this morning business period and in anticipation of going to the next legislation, I wish to make some opening comments about what happened here and make a plea to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but particularly my own side of the aisle, that we not object to going to consideration of Amtrak legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working on this issue for several years now. I think it is an important issue. It is an important part of our transportation system in America. I believe that for the future development of our country, for the mobility of our country, for the creation of jobs, the maintaining of jobs, for safety, security, and access, we should pay attention to infrastructure in America, and lanes, planes, trains, ports, and harbors. This is critical to our future economic development and to our American  lifestyle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working for years to upgrade and improve the Federal Aviation Administration, the air traffic control system so we can have less congestion in the airways and fewer delays, and modernization. We are still working on that. We did get FAA reauthorization a few years ago. Now it is back up but, unfortunately, stalled right now. We did pass a highway bill a few years ago that had many good things in it. But here is my point: You can only build so many lanes until you can't build any more.  You can only have so many planes in the sky until you can't have any more. So what is the other alternative? Trains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am not from a State that is hugely dependent on the rail passenger system. We get some of the benefits of it. But part of the problem is we don't have enough access, enough opportunities in that area, or we have delays and problems such as that. Why do we have delays? Because we haven't modernized the Amtrak system. Because we have not worked through the Transportation Department to put in some reforms, decide what is needed in terms of money, and how to get more capitalization. We haven't  done the reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to be involved the last time we did some Amtrak legislation. That was several years ago. I stood right in this very spot and told my friend JOHN MCCAIN from Arizona if it didn't work and if Amtrak didn't do a better job, I would eat it without salt. Well, I guess I should have probably eaten it without salt later on. It didn't do everything I hoped it would. But what is the alternative? Do we want a national rail passenger system or not? I think we do. I don't mean only on  the Northeast corridor, although I love the Northeast corridor. I have been delighted to work with my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, on this legislation, because I want good Amtrak service between Washington and New York City. Frankly, I would rather ride the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize Acela is one of the best in the country, but we need to do more. In fact, putting money in it--and by the way, not enough--year after year we are starving it to death and then we are saying, Why didn't it do better? It is because we haven't given them more opportunities, we haven't had more requirements, we haven't had reforms. I tried for the past 2 years to get this legislation up. We had some objections. We had some Senators who wanted to offer amendments. My attitude is: Fine. If  you have amendments, let's go with them. Administration: If you have some reforms, fine, let's do it. But we need to get this thing done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now here we are, we have a different majority. Senator Lautenberg is the chairman of the committee. But basically, this is the bill he and I put together 3 years ago. It is time to do it. It is not perfect. It has some reforms in it. It has some requirements in it. By the way, more people are riding Amtrak, and they have more income. They are doing better. If we give them more incentives, if we get them to close some of the routes that are never going to be profitable, they are not going  to work, it would be even better than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to give my full opening speech now, even though I sound like it. I am saying to my colleagues, we should not object to the motion to proceed on every bill, and filibuster the motion to proceed. That is bad business. Do it judiciously? Yes. If you want to slow this place down time after time after time after time, yes, we can do that. But I stood here on the floor earlier today and last night and said: If the Senate will do the right thing on this judicial nomination, Leslie Southwick,  that will be a step forward to show that this place can work together. We can be civil. We can be less partisan, and there will be some benefits. I am standing right here right now saying this is the next step. Let's not tangle this bill up because we are not ready, or because we may not like it. You don't like it? Vote against it. You want more? Bring</paragraph>
    <paragraph>your amendments. Let's get this done. I hope my colleagues will not try to block the motion to proceed. Senator Reid is going to ask unanimous consent that we go to the bill, and I hope and pray that if it is objected to, he is going to file cloture and he is going to make us eat it, because we ought to take this up and deal with it. If we want to kill it, shoot it down, but doing nothing is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has become very proficient at doing nothing; not just this year, but last year and the year before. We paid a price, because we didn't get anything done in the previous 2 years. Are we going to do it again or can we do something for the American people? This is one way we can do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I make that plea and I hope we can get something worked out when we get on this bill. I will not be a party to try to ram it through so quickly people can't get their amendments ready.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the Senator yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be glad to yield to my distinguished colleague and leader on this effort now, and to my friend from New Jersey, and I look forward to working with him on this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the obvious obstinacy at getting this on the floor seems to ignore the fact that you almost can't get anyplace from here or there without enormous delays, without enormous congestion, and with pollution problems, et cetera. Is it understood, I ask the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, how difficult it is for the country right now? You can't get an airplane that will leave on time or arrive on time with any degree of certainty. I, for instance, travel from  here up to Newark or to LaGuardia Airport, both of which are convenient to my home in New Jersey, and a flight that takes 36 minutes of air time takes 2 1/2  hours to get there, more often than not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So do the Senator's friends understand that this is a crisis moment for this country of ours? We have seen incidents so many times where the absence of a rail system--for instance, we threw away billions of dollars some years ago because nuclear powerplants that were built, ready to operate, couldn't get a license to go because there weren't satisfactory evacuation routes and it had to be by rail because the highways were unable to provide for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look at Katrina and we see how much better we could have done if rail was sufficiently employed down there, and we didn't get it, and people were jammed and stuck in there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no difference in what--when you cross the aisle, when you ask the question: Do we want to get things operating better? Do we want to facilitate our corporations to operate efficiently? Do we want to provide the jobs that go along when you have facilities for travel in place? Would people do better if they could travel by rail rather than have to get in a car and pay who knows what for gasoline? It is predicted that oil is going to go up to $200 a barrel one of these days. Well, Heaven  forbid that does come. We are not going to close shop and say we will go home and rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do the Senator's colleagues recognize that those who don't want to let us get this train of theirs started, do they realize that these problems are in front of us, I ask?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, I am sorry I went ahead and spoke first, because you are chairman of the committee and you have been providing real leadership in trying to get this legislation brought up. I did it because I wanted to make a plea to my colleagues on this side of the aisle to let this move forward. Let me emphasize that I have no indication there will be objection. They want to take a look at it. They want to make sure they will  have a chance to offer amendments or substitutes. I have assured them we will work with them. I believe we are going to be able to clear the hurdles, but I wanted to make a public plea so we could get on this legislation and guarantee the Members that their amendments will be considered and, in fact, in the past, when we worked together, we have accepted amendments and fought some of them, and we had votes. It is a novel idea in the Senate, to have a debate and have a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to say again I have enjoyed working with Senator Lautenberg. This is a lot bigger issue in New Jersey and along the eastern seaboard, I guess, but more and more it is important on the west coast, it is important to the Chicago area, it is important all over America. This is not about one region or the other region, or trying to accommodate business or labor; this is about American people. So I think my colleagues, hopefully, are going to realize that we ought to do something  about Amtrak, and this is the way to get it done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for his question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to respond to what my friend from Mississippi has said. We have worked together in the past and we have gotten things done in the past. We know that Amtrak finally has come into its place. We have a lot of work yet to do when you think about what travel is like these days in all forms. The highways are too congested. The airways are getting even more congested. The expectation is that delays are going to become even longer. So I hope those who want to discuss  it and those who want to amend it--the Senator is right, we should consider amendments. As a matter of fact, I think it is good if we do hear from people and see what problems they foresee. But we can't get it done unless we talk about it, unless we prepare for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are we about to say to the American people: No, continue to suffer? Stay stuck in traffic? Stay stuck at the airports? Time will take care of it? All you have to do is spend more time away from home, away from your job and away from things you might enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American people, get used to spending more time away from home in useless activities, such as listening to an idling engine or listening to the car radio or something like that. We cannot function this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the time is upon us where we have to do something about this. I believe this is an opportune time. I know a lot of colleagues on that side of the aisle want to see this happen. After all, we touch 40 States across the country. Wherever you look and see where there has been new or upgraded rail service, people are responding to it: On the west coast, and some of the routes out of Chicago--people are responding to it, and they are getting on trains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I use the trains frequently. The other day I got on an Amtrak train here, and it was a full train with barely a seat left. So people are demanding it. If we look at the example that exists, let's say in Europe or in Japan, and see what happens. When I wanted to take a plane one time from Brussels, where a NATO meeting was ongoing, to go to Paris, I tried to get a flight. They said: You cannot get an airplane from here because we go by train--200 miles in 1 hour and 20 minutes. Imagine what it  would do for travel in this country and business progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am ready whenever my colleague and our friends on that side of the aisle are ready. I am told we are all set here and ready to go.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield, since I have worked with the Senator on this issue, some of my colleagues have taken to calling me Senator "Lott-enberg." I know there is a bit of a regional difference. It is not quite as crowded in our neck of the woods, so you might come on down South and it would be a lot less crowded. However, I would like for them to be able to get there on Amtrak, to be able to catch that train in Washington or in Newark and run on down and come through Atlanta down  to Jackson, MS. I think they would enjoy it once they got there. I invite the Senator from New Jersey to take the ride to Jackson, and we will show him around down there.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>In response, A, I would like to do it; and, B, I wonder if people realize how many new lines are being dreamt up--I say "dreamt" up because unless we get the base going, nothing else is going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hear from colleagues in other States besides mine who say, you know, we could use train service here or there. We have seen something in New Jersey that exemplifies the value of rail service. We had a line open from the southernmost tip of our State to Trenton, our State capital. The ridership, at first, was very low. Before you knew it, we began to see buildings, factories, warehouses, et cetera, being built along the transit way. And now the area is beginning to prosper where it was just  dead and nothing was going on. That is what we have seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of talk about something called transit villages. In New Jersey, the most crowded State in the country, we don't think about villages really, but we have transit villages centered around a rail hub. People know they can get back and forth, and companies know employees can get back and forth to work and they can run an efficient operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a point in time when opportunity presents itself, and we ought not to miss it. If we cannot see it, we ought to let the public see that. Certainly, at this point in time, we ought to be able to discuss it. We should not have any obstruction to bringing the issue to the floor of the Senate. Let's get out in this public forum and have a discussion and see what we can do or whether there are problems that can be dealt with or maybe we can go to some other kinds of travel--I don't know  what kind, but we at least ought to take the one nearest to us that is the best option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are working on when we are going to be  able to get this up. I have a couple of points. One, we have a catch-22. Our Members want to make sure they have a chance to offer amendments, and we want to do that. At the same time, our leadership on both sides has to pay attention to when and how we get it to a conclusion. I think it is incumbent upon our leadership from the committee to work with Members to get amendments but also  not to let this become a punching bag and have Members throwing everything out but the kitchen sink.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we can move this through in a reasonable time. My attitude is, when Senators have amendments, come over and offer them. We will debate them and then have a vote. We will not shove it over until 9 or 10 o'clock tomorrow night. I think there is hesitation on both sides of the aisle, and we have to work through that. But we have done this before. We did this bill 2 years ago, or so, and we got 90-something votes. So we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one other observation: As I have worked on this, another part of the equation of having a good national rail passage system is encouraging our States to be able to do more on their own and build lines like we have in San Francisco to the L.A. area--there is incentive to do more--and at the same time, not telling poorer States that they have to do way more than they are capable of doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, a couple of weeks ago, I thought about this bill. I was at Big D's Barbeque at Pocahontas, MS. The City of New Orleans, a sleeper Amtrak train, came whizzing by Big D's Tee Pee. They were ballin' the jack headed to New Orleans. It had about six or eight cars, which is  relatively short. But the important thing was that they were going lickity-split.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are going to be able to get these trains, in a reasonable way, where they want to go, part of the problem is a problem the freight lines have. If they are going to get off on a side track and let the Amtrak go through, they have to build side tracks. We need more lines all across America. Union Pacific, Burlington Northern, Santa Fe--they need to build more lines across this country. We need to encourage the freight lines to build more capacity, more lines, and more side tracks, so they  can work with Amtrak, so that Amtrak is not adding to the cost of doing business of the freight lines. So I am looking at that equation too. We don't want a conflict between Amtrak and freight lines. We want them both to be able to make a profit and deliver the goods and services to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are working on that side of the equation too, to make sure that Amtrak has a way to be on time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator from Mississippi remembers that yesterday we had a hearing on freight railroads, and that traffic is going to be up some 44 percent by 2020. They are concerned about how to get it done. At the same time, we have to provide for passenger rail service. This is a good time for all sides to get together and start moving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the Senator remember this bill was processed on the Senate floor last year? We had a vote that was 93 to 6. I lost a year. It was actually in 2005.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, I think that is right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>The vote was 93 to 6, I remind everybody. This was popularly supported, totally understood. We were on our way to the next station, and it just didn't work out. Things were a little tumultuous, to put it mildly. Now there is a cooler moment to think about it and present it. We have time available on the floor, and I think to waste it would be a terrible loss when we can discuss this important problem with a solution for the country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague. The occupant of the chair, the Senator from Maryland, I suspect, supports this too. I am ready to do business when we get the go-ahead to take up this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
