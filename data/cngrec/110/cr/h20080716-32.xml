    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, intelligence is critical to every decision affecting America's national security. Whether the challenge is learning the intentions of our Nation's adversaries or detecting the location of the next roadside IED in Iraq, America needs a well-resourced and well-managed intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This committee's primary responsibilities are to authorize funds for the intelligence agencies, to conduct vigorous oversight over their operations and to ensure that those operations are effective, legal and an appropriate use of taxpayer money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hoekstra, the gentleman from Michigan, for working with me in a bipartisan fashion to bring this bill to the floor. I also want to thank the staffs on both sides of the aisle for the great work that they have done to bring this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, as in years past, I have gone to the front lines to see our courageous intelligence professionals perform their jobs. They do this quietly, often without recognition or praise. Many spend time away from their families, often in very dangerous situations and under very dangerous conditions. This bill is the tangible sign of our support for the women and men of our America's intelligence agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're providing robust funding for our most important priorities including HUMINT, language capabilities and technical capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our principal concern continues to be that al Qaeda is stronger today than at any time since September 11, 2001. Osama bin Laden and his key deputies remain at large. But al Qaeda is not the only terrorist group that has gained strength. Over the past 7 years, Hezbollah and Hamas have become more capable and even more determined. Dangerous states, including Syria, are pursuing nuclear capabilities. There is the possibility that one of these states, or even a rogue scientist, could transfer fissile  material to a terrorist group. This must remain our foremost priority and our top concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill invests in people, our most precious resource. It adds funding to enhance human intelligence collection, not only for counterterrorism, but also for enduring and emerging global security issues, such as challenges that we face in Asia, Africa and Latin America, to name a few. This bill also contains a number of provisions that promote greater accountability, including the creation of a new Inspector General for the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will improve language capabilities in the intelligence community by adding funding for speakers of critical languages and requiring reports to  Congress to evaluate progress in this perennial problem area. The bill also mandates implementation of security clearance reform to make it easier for first and second generation Americans, many of whom have critical language skills, to serve in the intelligence community with proper clearances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned earlier that one of the responsibilities of this committee is oversight. Yet this administration has repeatedly failed to comply with the National Security Act of 1947, which mandates that our committee be "fully and currently informed" of all the intelligence activities from the administration. This bill enhances congressional oversight by ensuring that the committee receives the information that it needs to perform its inherent oversight function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working on a bipartisan basis, our committee adopted two provisions to enhance reporting on intelligence activities to the full membership of the congressional intelligence committees. One provision would restrict 75 percent of all covert action funds until the full membership of the intelligence committees is briefed on all covert actions in effect as of April 24, 2008. A second provision would restrict the administration's attempts to brief only the chairman and ranking member and clarifies  which information must be reported to our full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also authorizes much of the requests for the foundational activities of the cybersecurity initiative, but it also expresses the committee's serious concerns about potential policy, implementation and governance issues. Our committee is also concerned that Congress does not have a comprehensive understanding of the magnitude of human and fiscal intelligence resources that have been devoted to Iraq, possibly at the expense of fighting the war on terror. <bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill> requires a detailed  report to our committee on this very topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also addresses a number of long-term technical challenges in the intelligence community. It does so by adding significant resources to modernize signals intelligence capabilities and integrate them into the global enterprise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Chairman, despite the size of the budget request, the administration did not include funds adequate to keep the U.S. intelligence community competitive in advanced technologies. Research and development funding is our Nation's investment in maintaining our edge in state of the art technologies. Our bill adds funds to four agencies specifically for that purpose. And the committee urges the executive branch to sustain, if not increase, this level of funding in future budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our markup, Mr. Chairman, the committee adopted a number of amendments offered by both the majority and minority members. One of those important amendments, crafted with bipartisan cooperation, will prevent CIA contractors from engaging in interrogations unless the Director of National Intelligence provides a waiver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our goal is to put this committee back in the authorization business by getting a bill to the President's desk that he can sign. To do that, we can't tackle every single important issue in this one bill. But if we fail to pass this bill, we risk eroding Congress' ability to strengthen and oversee intelligence operations that are vital to American national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield myself as much time as I shall consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the annual Intelligence Authorization Act is one of the most important bills that the House passes each year. It provides and allocates resources critical to national security programs that are the front lines of America's defense and foreign policies and, most critically, work to detect, prevent and disrupt potential terrorist attacks against the American people. The bill is also essential to ensure close and effective congressional oversight of the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are issues that remain to be worked out as the legislative process continues. But I appreciate the work that Chairman Reyes has done to avoid many of the contentious items that have recently prevented the enactment of an intelligence authorization bill. And I appreciate that the bill reflects areas of consensus on critical national security issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this bill is strong in two areas. First, it was significantly improved by seven Republican amendments that were adopted on a bipartisan basis to address what I believe are important issues in priorities facing the intelligence community. Among these, the committee adopted my amendment to remove all earmarks from the bill, a significant step forward. Our intelligence program should be based on only one primary consideration, what best ensures that the intelligence community is able  to do its job in the interest of the national security of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee adopted an amendment offered by my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers) to limit the size and unintended bureaucratic growth of the Office of the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence. The bill also includes another amendment by Congressman Rogers to require a high-level strategic evaluation of the FBI's progress in transforming its FBI's intelligence capabilities. This process may not be moving forward fast enough to accomplish the needed changes and needs  close attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is also strengthened by significant provisions to improve congressional oversight of the intelligence community and the executive branch which addressed issues I have repeatedly raised since serving as chairman of the committee. These include provisions to clarify that each member of the Intelligence Committee must be fully and currently briefed on current activities. Again, I'm pleased that we're able to take and improve this oversight on a bipartisan basis. Republicans and Democrats  on the committee both believe that we need this information to be able to effectively do our job. Some work remains to be done to smooth this out. But we have taken the right steps to move this forward. I appreciate the chairman's work to develop this framework for this important reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand and he understands that the executive branch may not like enhanced oversight and that they have expressed their concern about the provisions of the bill that strengthen the oversight process, including congressional notification, increased reporting and auditing. But there is no single current issue on which there is stronger bipartisan consensus on the committee than our concern that the administration is not fulfilling its statutory duty to keep each member of the committee fully  and currently informed with respect to certain intelligence matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past year alone, I joined with Chairman Reyes to call on the President to brief the members of the committee with respect to intelligence regarding the al Kibar facility in Syria. The full committee was not briefed until the day the information was subsequently disclosed to the public. The committee was briefed months too late, and we received the information after the media did. On another matter, the administration has refused to brief all members of the committee even though  it has briefed five members of the committee staff. It is clear that reforms are necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these legislative provisions, I believe that the classified annex adequately supports our needs in important areas such as human intelligence collection and contains additional provisions to enhance oversight. While I may not agree with each of the specific authorizations, on balance the classified portion of the bill generally reflects consensus on the programmatic requirements needed to protect our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these areas of consensus, I must point out that I have concerns with parts of the bill and the action of the Rules Committee not to make certain important amendments in order. I'm disappointed with certain provisions relating to national intelligence space systems. Certain levels of funding fall short, and the bill fails to stimulate a sense of urgency in overhead architecture and shortfalls. In certain areas, it mandates technical solutions without a complete analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have concern with what I believe is an unnecessarily complex and unwieldy provision to create a new Inspector General of the intelligence  community. While I support the enhancement of oversight for community-wide issues, this provision would significantly duplicate existing efforts and further grow the size of the DNI bureaucracy. I hope that we can continue to improve the bill as it moves through the process. I also hope that we can work to address  concerns that have been raised by the intelligence community with respect to section 425 of the bill concerning the use of contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I need to express my strong concern that the Rules Committee did not make in order an amendment I submitted that would prevent funds authorizing the bill from being used to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States. This provision should not be necessary. I believe that the public consensus that trained terrorists should not be brought into the American cities should be clear and overwhelming. However, there is a significant possibility that lawyers may try to argue that trained  terrorist detainees should be released on American streets. This would be judicial activism at its worst, unsupported by either clear legal precedent or statutory authority. Congress must send a clear message immediately on this critical issue. We may have the opportunity to do that later today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On balance, this bill is a workable bill. It needs to be improved. And I look forward to seeing exactly how the amendments process moves forward through the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer) who serves as chairman of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. May I add, Mr. Chairman, that on a personal note, I'm privileged and proud to have served with Mr. Cramer on the Intelligence Committee for about 8 years. This is his last authorization bill. He will be retiring at the end of this Congress. So I just wanted to thank the gentleman for his service  and for his work. He has never stopped working up to the very end here in his last term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Cramer, for your great work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400084" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, thank you for those kind words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, have enjoyed almost every minute of service on this Intelligence Committee. I say to Mr. Hoekstra, as well, the years that we put in together trying to steer through post 9/11, the struggles of holding the agencies' feet to the fire but at the same time forcing them to change, to do things differently to protect this country in a more unified way, it has been extremely rewarding to see both sides come together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I wanted to use my time today to say that I stand in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill> because I think this edition of the intelligence authorization bill does the same thing, and that is it forces the agencies to be more efficient, it forces them to work together, and at the same time it is providing our men and women around this world the resources that they need to do an even better job of protecting us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned about our access to space. It is in the national interest of the United States to have domestic capability for assured access to space. So as this bill proceeds forward, I hope we will make sure that while we are performing oversight and we are forcing the agencies to become more efficient, to consolidate what they do, that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleague from Alabama, Terry Everett, who is going to speak in a few minutes as well, has been particularly concerned about the access to space issue. My colleague, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett) is leaving the committee as well, so Alabama loses one on each side after this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Everett, I want to say that the people of Alabama and the people of this country are proud of your career here in the United States Congress. We are proud in north Alabama of our partnership with you. And as I have watched you through the committee process bring the access to space issues to the forefront, this country is a better place because of your service here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my colleagues. We work hard in cramped, windowless rooms to make sure that the agencies answer the questions that we want our constituents to have answered. They come sometimes to the committee kicking and screaming, but I am proud of the work you do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to extend my congratulations to Mr. Cramer on his retirement. We are going to miss you in the committee, Mr. Cramer. Alabama is going to lose two great Members of Congress, two members who have helped make the Intelligence Committee a better committee, who have studied the issues. We will miss you and wish you well, but I am sure we will see you again. Thank you for the work and effort you have put on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett) is also going to be leaving. I am not sure what the folks in Alabama have put in the water this year, but they are drinking the same thing and have decided to retire. Again, Mr. Everett has also contributed a tremendous amount of time, energy and effort in learning the issues of the Intelligence Committee and making sure that the work we do on the committee is a bipartisan effort, coordinated with the efforts in the Armed  Services Committee to make sure that the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee are moving in the same direction and doing the things that are necessary to keep America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400127" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Cramer. I can assure the American people that knowing the members on both sides of the aisle who serve on the Intelligence Committee and the staff who supports them, even though two Alabamians are leaving, the Nation will still be safe and in good hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2009 Intelligence Authorization Act. The process for this year's bill was much improved over last year; so for that, I thank my friend and chairman, Silvestre Reyes, and our ranking member, Mr. Hoekstra. It has been 3 years since we have had an intelligence authorization bill, and that has created a void in many important policy areas and in programmatic guidance for the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical that we get a bill passed through the House and Senate that can be signed by the President, and I hope that can be accomplished before we adjourn this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a number of concerns about the bill, some of which have been detailed in the minority views of the committee report, but I would like to focus on a few of the joint programs that have military application as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the national security space systems, the bill falls short of fully addressing problems in our overhead architecture. As the report notes, "National security space systems have been and will continue to be a cornerstone of the Nation's intelligence collection capability."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Hoekstra pointed out, critical national security space systems are not properly funded in conjunction with a complete programmatic analysis that shows a way forward. This can be addressed and hopefully will be addressed in conference with the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I wind down my career in Congress, this will be my last intelligence authorization work. The work we do here is fascinating and important to our national security, and I am pleased to have been a part of this for the past 6 years. As one of the crossover members from the House Armed Services Committee, I want to reiterate----</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield my colleague an additional minute.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400127" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to reiterate the importance of having members serve simultaneously on both committees. It is especially important to have a member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee serve on HPSCI in order to maintain a clear understanding of how the shared military and intelligence overhead programs operate so that the right hand, Mr. Chairman, knows what the left hand is doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say again I appreciate having served over the years with the members of the committee. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is not  perfect, but it is a very good bill and it needs passing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, before recognizing a very senior and valued member of our committee, I wanted to wish my good friend and former chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee on Armed Forces well on his retirement. I have had the privilege of working with Mr. Everett since I have been in Congress on Armed Services and also on Intelligence. I know how much he cares about the issues that affect our national security, and so I want to wish him well in his retirement as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good luck, Terry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), a senior member of our committee, who serves as the chairwoman of our Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to salute the chairman of our committee for his superb leadership and caring so much about not only the issues of intelligence but everyone that is a part of the intelligence community. I want to thank all of the marvelous staff on the majority and minority side, and I salute the ranking member of the committee as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a tough committee to serve on. People don't know what we are talking about. We do it in secret. We really can't talk to our colleagues very much about it. And yet we make some of the weightiest decisions that any Members of Congress would make because we deal with what is the most important issue, and that is our national security, the protection of the American people and giving the intelligence community, making the choices to give the intelligence community all the tools it needs in  order to function and protect the American people and that we weigh and balance and always know that we are working under the Constitution of the United States of America. So this is really where the rubber meets the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bill. Just like all of the other bills we deal with, there are pluses and minuses. I am very pleased that there are no earmarks in this bill. That is the first time since I came onto the committee that that is the case. I am very glad that 75 percent of the dollars for covert action have been fenced. In other words, no notification from the administration and from the intelligence community, no money. And that's the way it should be because the American people expect us to verify.  They expect us to know and then we can take action. We have to do oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time in the history of our country, we have brought together a National Intelligence Assessment on global climate change and the effect it will have on national security. I am very proud of the work we have been able to do on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time there will be an inspector general in the intelligence community; and the administration, believe it or not, is still fighting that. Imagine having an inspector general, independent oversight of the intelligence community. I think that's a darn good idea and I hope it will prevail and that the President changes his mind on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still have a lot of work to do to have more human intelligence in countries where we need them. We have a lot of work to do on black prison sites, the operation of them by the CIA and renditions. But with that, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend especially Congressman Bud Cramer for the magnificent, honest work he has done on the Intelligence Committee and here in the Congress and wish him well, and Mr. Everett, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support the bill. It has good things and it has some other things that are missing. But overall, I think it is a bill worth supporting.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), a member of the committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400404" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is not the intelligence authorization bill that I would have written exactly, but I think it is important to start out by thanking the chairman and the ranking member for taking some risk to have a bipartisan bill that can have support from both sides of the aisle. That is unfortunately fairly rare in this Chamber to be able to work together on something that is important, especially in national security, and yet that has happened here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intelligence is very important for our country's security. In many ways it is the first line of defense. Certainly all our other national security efforts depend upon intelligence. And so working together in a bipartisan way, even being willing to take some risks to have a bill with bipartisan support, means we can't have everything we want, but we will work together in order to move this bill forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I think it is important to acknowledge the enormous influence of three retiring Members, three Members retiring from Congress after this Congress: the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) whose personal military background, intelligence, and nature of her district has made her a leader on many issues, especially in the area of technical collection; the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Everett) with whom I serve on the Armed Services Committee, and we have worked on  many issues, but no one is as knowledgeable and passionate about the issue of space and space policy as the gentleman from Alabama; and then the other gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer), he and I were partners in the last Congress when for the first time this Congress stood up an oversight subcommittee</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there are a number of commonsense reforms in this bill that may not make headlines. One of the issues Mr. Cramer and I have worked on, for example, in the past is how can we measure improvement in intelligence, for example, in foreign language capability. There are some specific provisions in this bill which do help us have specific measurements so we can tell whether we are increasing our capability, not just as far as numbers of people but in their fluency in specific  languages. That is absolutely critical for the purpose of intelligence. And yet even for something like that, it is hard for any of us to measure whether we are making the improvements that need to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making sure that any administration gives this committee the information we deserve to do our job is a challenge. This bill deserves support.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400349" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support <bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill>. I would first like to thank Chairman Reyes and Ranking Member Hoekstra for their leadership in helping us put together a good bipartisan bill. I also am going to miss Bud Cramer, Terry Everett, and Heather Wilson. We have all worked well together on this committee. You will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to vote for this bill because it supports the men and women who work within the intelligence community. The National Security Agency, the NSA, is headquartered in my district. I personally know that NSA's employees work very hard to ensure our Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We must continue to invest in the people and resources necessary to make our intelligence community effective. Intelligence is the best defense against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill advances the Cybersecurity Initiative to protect our computer networks, a very important issue that we will be dealing with in the future, cybersecurity attacks. We know now that certain countries are attacking the United States of America through the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, it increases research and development so that we can maintain our technical advantage; and, three, invests in both satellite and airborne collection and in the systems needed to  process, exploit and distribute this data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intelligence community faces enduring technical challenges, but this bill provides our people, who are our most important asset, with the tools they need to do their jobs well. In order to protect our country from threats from countries such as China and Russia, we must continue to invest heavily in science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill lays the foundation for the future and communicates areas of concern to current intelligence leaders and the next Presidential administration.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, thank you very, very much for working in such a bipartisan way. I often think after some of our most spirited meetings in the Intelligence Committee, where we have passionate, civil debates, how proud, really, America would be that all of us on both sides of the aisle give all of ourselves to the right outcome on these bills. I want to thank you for allowing that debate to happen in committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Mr. Thompson, I have enjoyed working with you on the committee, and I think we have done some great things in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is one of those bills that while I think both sides probably would have had a few things different, but because we committed ourselves to put the country first and bipartisanship as our final goal and what works for America, you have a package here that I think sends a great message to the most important group that this bill will impact, and that's the men and women who risk their lives every single day trying to make sure we have the best intelligence to our war fighters,  to our police officers, and to keep this country safe. For all of that, to the staffs on both sides, thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to bring your attention to two particular issues. There are a lot of great things in here to think about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is the FBI policy. Thank you again for working with us on what I think is a growing problem with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and this, I think, was the first signal we need to get a handle on it. The FBI implemented an "up or out" policy for its supervisors that was supposed to allow new people in and promote the supervisory special agents, people who had over years developed a Rolodex where they could call the local police chiefs, work with the local community, get to know and  understand and gain the trust of these local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have hustled them out after 5 years. They may be the best performing supervisory agents the Bureau has ever had, but when the clock runs out, you're done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that policy, we have lost half. Almost 290 supervisory special agents have left management in the FBI, retired, stepped down, quit, whatever they have decided to do that wasn't in their interest or their family's interest, because of this policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no policy that discriminates against half of your management that we would call successful at a time where we need experience to guide these new agents, which are about half of them, by the way, are fairly new, I think under 5 years or 7 years, something like that. We have tried to work with the Director and say this is the wrong approach, this is a punishment approach. You have great men and women committing themselves to these careers, dedicating themselves to these supervisory  positions. We need to reward them, not punish them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have tried to set up a housing policy to entice them. Three years, longer than 3 years, even after the agreement from the Director, we have been working on this to no avail. It has gone nowhere. Instead, they continue to say this is a policy that works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are separating themselves from the field, and it's dangerous. Over the last 2 weeks I bet I have talked to a dozen agents, some in supervisory roles, others who are not, who are impacted by their supervisors either leaving or new ones being hired, 12 agents, 100 percent unanimity. This is a bad and dangerous plan for the future of the FBI.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I think that this is an issue that we have to even pay more attention to. This is an important step to regain the confidence of the FBI and its leadership. It has to happen. Thanks for your leadership on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I just want to talk about the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence. I have worked with Mr. Thompson on this. We have spent a lot of time understanding this. Our concerns are real, and the intelligence community concerns are real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We created this new organization. Its job was to coordinate, not be operational. We have found that it goes well beyond mission creep, and it is in mission grasp. It is bloated, it's too big, and it became an agency not that supported the decision and calculations of the field, but became supported by the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a dangerous development in intelligence. I appreciate working with you. I know we have a lot more work to do. Congratulations to all on a bill that will, I think and believe, keep America safer.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400403" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to thank both Chairman Reyes and Ranking Member Hoekstra for their leadership and making sure we had a good bipartisan bill that benefits the people of this great country, the staff that worked so hard to make this happen on both sides of the aisle, and, in particular, the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Rogers, for working together to make this a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Human intelligence, or HUMINT, is one of the most difficult but effective means of understanding our adversaries' plans and intentions. This bill adds funds improve HUMINT collection on counterterrorism and other critical national security challenges. It also adds HUMINT resources for global challenges, such as the political and humanitarian crisis in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The events unfolding in those regions demonstrate that we must always have the resources to understand these  threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The information we collect, however, is only useful if analysts translate it into actionable intelligence for policymakers and law enforcement. For that reason, this bill provides resources to improve intelligence analysis across the entire intelligence community. It also authorizes additional personnel to support State and local law enforcement so they can better address the challenges of border security, counterterrorism and infrastructure protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the bill also calls for fiscal restraint. As Mr. Rogers mentioned, since its creation in 2004, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has grown into a bloated bureaucracy that hinders, rather than facilitates, intelligence complexes and analysis. This bill adds an amendment that Mr. Rogers and I introduced in committee that prevents further growth in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Chairman, this legislation provides critical intelligence resources for our troops and strengthens oversight of intelligence support to the military. Many of us have visited our troops in Iraq, and we have seen firsthand that good intelligence saves American lives on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will greatly improve our intelligence capabilities and enhance our national security. I urge all my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I too want to add my name to those who are very appreciative and thankful for our friends, Mr. Everett and Mr. Cramer, who did a great job on the committee. They were a pleasure to work for, they are fine Americans, and we are going to miss them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400264" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard, I would say to my colleagues repeatedly today, this is not a perfect bill. We also should hear that shouldn't be a surprise. Rarely on the House floor here have perfect bills been delivered. Rather, as I think the Founding Fathers would have intended, we see a work in progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill that started off at a certain place, that came through the committee process, and although I may be somewhat prejudiced, I firmly believe has been far improved from that starting point through that committee process. There have been some seven amendments that I think have upgraded it and have put us on the right path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say Mr. Chairman, I have enormous respect, enormous affection for both the distinguished chairman from the great State of Texas, my good friend, Silvestre Reyes, as well as the gentleman from Michigan, the distinguished ranking member, who have gone so far in working together to make such a difference. There are far, far fewer bills that reach this House floor that are more important in this day and age for the safety and for the security of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to tell you I share the distinguished ranking member's concerns about the failures of this administration to adequately inform, to adequately brief all the Members on both sides of the aisle, not just so-called leadership, but all the Members, as to the ongoing activities with respect to our intelligence systems throughout this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that the American people need to be assured that as we go forward in these very dangerous and uncertain times that there are certain individuals in this House that have, as the law intends, the opportunity to be fully informed and make sound judgments about what is appropriate and what is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, as a member of this committee, I am somewhat frustrated by the lack of total input, the lack of total briefing that has occurred from the administration side, and I look forward to a better day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think tomorrow can help us to further improve this bill. We have the opportunity now, through the conference process, to continue to improve upon it, to continue to make sure that the end product that we send to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, to the President, is a good bill, a bill that in these very challenging moments of our lives ensures the American people have the best possible, the most well-resourced, and the most responsible intelligence activities we can possibly have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very appropriate start. It deserves our support, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I rise in support of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The work in the Intelligence Committee is some of the most difficult work that goes on here in the House, behind closed doors, necessarily with little public input, but we are blessed with a good staff and a good chairman. We never forget that our work is about people, about the safety of the American people and about the hardworking, brave people of the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill> contains some useful provisions that are designed to strengthen congressional oversight. Among these is a fence of 75 percent of covert action funds, fenced until each member of the House and Senate intelligence committees has been fully briefed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it would be sufficient to say that this administration has taken a cavalier attitude toward its legal obligations to keep the committees fully and currently informed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would require the CIA Inspector General to conduct audits of all covert action programs regularly. It would increase critical research and development activities and improve foreign language capabilities. It would prohibit the use of contractors for CIA detainee interrogations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would clarify what "fully and currently informed" in the law means for briefing Congress so that all information necessary for Congress would be provided, and it explicitly requires that all committee members be notified in general, not just selected members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It requires guidelines for the implementation of a multilevel security clearance to increase linguistic and cultural expertise. It would require reports on the use of contractors, on workforce diversity, on foreign language proficiency, on the protection of intelligence officers' identities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of good features. This is a good bill that strengthens our oversight of the intelligence community. We do have a long way to go to provide the kind of oversight needed after many years when the intelligence community got almost every wish, billions of dollars with insufficient justification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do support the bill and urge that my colleagues do as well.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as you know, bringing accountability and transparency to contracting has been a priority of mine, and I have worked to ensure that companies that we award contracts to are held responsible for any abuses. I believe we must make certain that the intelligence community is not using U.S. taxpayer dollars to enter into or renew contracts with companies that may be engaging in serious abuses of law and violence toward civilians and whose actions go unpunished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Around the world our country is contracting with private companies that employ individuals who do not wear the badge of the United States but whose behavior has, on numerous occasions, severely damaged the credibility and security of our military and harmed our relationship with other governments. Perhaps the most egregious example came on September 16, 2007, when private security contractors employed by Blackwater Worldwide killed 17 civilians and wounded many more in downtown Baghdad. No one  has been held accountable for this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a minimum, we need a more transparent process to hold private contractors accountable and more information in order to understand their impact on our Intelligence Community, our armed forces and our larger objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for including language prohibiting the use of contractors for interrogation, as well as a provision requiring a comprehensive report on the use of contractors in the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I may ask the chairman in a brief colloquy if the chairman will work with me to include additional language in the conference report calling for a report that examines the extent of criminal activity among intelligence community contractors and assesses the effects of hiring contracting companies that are responsible for serious legal violations.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member on their hard work on this bill, particularly staff, who also has worked hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill>, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the bill contains a number of important provisions to strengthen our intelligence community and enhance national security that many of my colleagues have already been speaking about, I am particularly pleased that it represents a reasonable and measured response to the administration's cybersecurity initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this bill, the cybersecurity initiative, is the administration's response to the cybersecurity threats facing the Nation. And although the administration has been slow in recognizing this threat, I believe the cyber initiative is a move in the right direction, but requires careful scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this bill reduces funding in selected areas where it is not adequately justified. However, recognizing that cybersecurity is a real and growing threat that the Federal Government has been slow in addressing, the Intelligence Committee has authorized more than 90 percent of the administration's requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, the bill clearly demonstrates that the committee does not intend to write the administration a blank check for the cybersecurity initiative, which is a multi-year, multi-billion dollar project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we need a thorough assessment of the technical feasibility and scalability of the initiative and a careful balance between cybersecurity and privacy protections. Thus, the bill envisions an advisory panel of senior representatives of Congress, the Executive Branch and industry who can tackle these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was co-chair of the CSIS Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency, basically a commission that will present a blueprint on cybersecurity for the next President. I have been deeply involved in developing recommendations for a national cybersecurity plan that protects, among other things, our critical infrastructure assets and infrastructure itself, as well as Federal networks and also the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, and as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science Technology, I will continue to ensure and exercise rigorous congressional oversight over this issue as it evolves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure before us is an important first step in addressing our cybersecurity threats and closing that vulnerability and it is, obviously, a critical national security issue. And I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I commend Chairman Reyes for his leadership, and also thank staff for the great work they have done on this bill today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is now my privilege to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400361" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding, and rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate our chairman, Mr. Reyes and his staff for putting the bill together. In particular, I am proud that this bill authorizes the funding that our intelligence community needs to help prevent terrorists from attacking the United States with a nuclear device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A nuclear terrorist attack on the United States or on our troops in the field is the greatest national security threat facing our country. While part of this fight occurs at our borders, the intelligence community is the tip of the spear, at the forefront of our efforts to prevent a nuclear terror attack. The many analysts and officers of the intelligence community ensure that we know as much as possible, not only about the terrorists who would attack us with a nuclear device or a radiological  disease, but also about those who may sell fissile material that they seek. This bill supports our men and women in the intelligence community as they attempt to ensure that nuclear material stays out of the wrong hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is much easier to prevent terrorists from getting a hold of nuclear material than prevent them from getting nuclear material or a nuclear device into the country. Our country is large, our borders are porous, and we have to stop the access of people who mean us ill from gaining nuclear material.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill protects Americans against nuclear terrorism by funding the Nuclear Materials Information Program as well, a Department of Energy-led effort to understand how much nuclear material is stored worldwide, what the security is at these sites, the signatures of this material, also a key ingredient of our nuclear forensics efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is more that we still must do. <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, signed into law by the President almost a year ago created the position of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation and Terrorism. We must have an individual, a single person who can marshal all the resources and expertise to prevent the most horrific attack imaginable. However, no one has been appointed to this post. It remains vacant. I urge the President to fill this position as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nuclear terrorism is the preeminent threat of our time, and all efforts have to be made to mitigate that threat. What we need to do is imagine what a post-nuclear 9/11 Commission report would look like, what would its recommendations be? And we have to implement those recommendations now; not wait until there is a calamity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that this legislation addresses the threat by authorizing the resources our intelligence community needs to meet that threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, I want to thank you, Chairman Reyes, for your leadership, and urge all of the Members to support the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Obviously, we are going to go through a process of trying to improve this bill while we are here on the floor today. I can look forward to going through that process. I look forward to hopefully passing an improved bill out of the floor, and then look forward to going to conference and hope that we can continue this same kind of partnership in trying to get, not only a bill through the House, but getting it through a conference process and getting a bill to the President that the President will  sign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that the Intelligence Committees, that the House and the Senate, put their imprint on the intelligence community. We haven't been able to do that for 3 years. It is important that we do it and that we do it at this time. The intelligence community needs the kind of direction and the parameters that we have established in this bill, to ensure that Congress can do its work, but also that the intelligence community can do its work within a framework that has been established by the  Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I now yield myself the remainder of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again, I want to say how much I appreciate the cooperation and the work that the ranking member has done to bring this bill to the floor. I want to thank staffs on both sides in particular. I want to thank my Staff Director, Mike Delaney, my Deputy Staff Director and General Counsel, Wyndee Parker, and Chief Counsel, Jeremy Bash, for the great work that they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also want to thank our Vice Chair of the committee, Congressman Leonard Boswell, who, unfortunately, was unable to accompany us here today because he is recuperating in the hospital. All of us wish him well and we want to see him back as soon as possible. He is a hard worker and contributes a lot to our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also want to say that this is a good, solid bill. This is the kind of effort that our men and women in the intelligence community serving us proudly throughout the world deserve.  Each and every one of them gives their best effort, and they deserve the respect and the support of every Member of this body and everyone in this country. We thank them for the effort that they put forward, and we appreciate the commitment, the dedication and their professionalism,  as well as the sacrifices that their families provide for our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I want to say that it has been a privilege to lead this committee. We have great Members on both sides that care very much about our national security and work very hard on all the issues that are important to our country and our national security.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all of those who serve our country through the gathering of intelligence for the protection of the American people. I appreciate their dedication and their attention to the gathering facts for deliberations related to our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the current administration has destroyed the credibility of the Intelligence Community through the fabrication of intelligence. The Bush administration continues a relentless pursuit of a self-serving agenda rather than an agenda that serves the best interests of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No single example can more clearly illustrate this point than the administration's falsification and cherry-picking of intelligence to build a phony case for the war in Iraq. Through the manipulation of intelligence, the administration sold a war to the American public based on false statements that included a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda, Iraq and 9/11, as well as false claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and intentions to attack the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As long as President Bush remains in office the intelligence budget will continue to be at risk for being used to support subversive intelligence and provide license to the administration to engage in criminal activity by shaping intelligence to fit corrupt policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Bush administration there have emerged several high-profile classified leaks to the media that have reemphasized the need for reform within our intelligence agencies. From these media leaks, we not only became aware of the efforts to manipulate intelligence and to falsify a cause for war against Iraq but we also became aware of the illegal NSA domestic wiretapping program without a court order. We became aware of the rumored CIA detention centers in Eastern Europe, and the CIA's extraordinary  rendition program, used to transport suspects to other nations with less restrictive torture policies. It is regrettable that intelligence is often reshaped to fit doctrine instead of doctrine being reshaped in the face of the facts of intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this bill will not stop unilateral covert U.S. intelligence operations aimed at bringing about regime change in Iran. As reported in a recent article in The New Yorker, the Bush administration is already engaged in collecting covert intelligence on Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program instead of engaging Iran in high-level diplomatic negotiations without preconditions. The administration has made clear their thirst for a war with Iran. The opportunity for unscrupulous tactics by  this administration with respect to Iran clearly exists as long as this body stands idly by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly oppose this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400326" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill>, the Fiscal Year 2009 Intelligence Authorization Act, and the important measures to strengthen oversight and accountability of contractors that the bill includes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to first thank Intelligence Committee Chairman SILVESTRO REYES for his leadership in crafting this bill. Chairman REYES very graciously worked with me to include in this bill major portions of legislation I recently introduced along with Representative JAN SCHAKOWSKY, <bill type="h" number="5973">H.R. 5973</bill>, the Transparency and Accountability in Intelligence Contracting Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last several years, I have been working to correct a serious lack of attention to the management and oversight of contractors in the Intelligence Community. Press reports indicate that roughly half of the Intelligence Community's budget is now contracted out, yet there is little understanding of where the money goes, what kinds of activities contractors are performing, whether this contracting saves taxpayer money, and whether the contracted activities are appropriate for private corporations  to perform. Additionally, accountability for misconduct by contractors has been seriously deficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rush to outsource sensitive government functions has placed private contractors at the center of some of the most significant national controversies in recent years. Contractors have been accused of torturing or abusing foreign detainees, including the practice of waterboarding high-level suspects. Contractors have participated in warrantless electronic surveillance and data-mining programs targeting U.S. citizens. Contractors have been deeply involved in the analysis of critical intelligence  on Iraq and al Qaeda, including, reportedly, the preparation of the President's Daily Brief on intelligence matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contractors may very well have a place in the Intelligence Community, but their role must be carefully considered, thoroughly managed, and strenuously overseen. A national conversation about the appropriate use of contractors in our national security apparatus is long overdue. This is a conversation the Administration skipped over as it was implementing this major shift in the way we conduct intelligence operations, but for the sake of the integrity of our national defense, we must collectively  scrutinize this practice and set clear boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5959">H.R. 5959</bill> begins to put Intelligence Community contracting back on a rational and stable footing. It incorporates a number of provisions for which I have advocated. Let me highlight just a few examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the legislation would explicitly prohibit the use of contractors for the performance of interrogations. Interrogations should be carried out by individuals who are well-trained, fall within a clear chain of command, and have a sworn loyalty to the United States--not by corporate, for-profit contractors. Given how delicate such interrogations are, and how critical the intelligence they obtain might be, I believe that drawing this red line is a commonsense step with which all members should  agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House passed a similar restriction on Defense Department contractors as part of the Defense Authorization bill in May. This bill would appropriately extend that limit to intelligence contractors outside the DoD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill would require an assessment of the number and cost of contractors employed by the intelligence community, the types of activities being performed by contractors, an analysis of cost savings, and a description of mechanisms available for ensuring oversight and accountability. This assessment will give Congress the data we need to ascertain whether the use of contractors for certain activities is beneficial and what reforms may be needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill would require the Director of National Intelligence to assess the appropriateness of using contractors for especially sensitive activities, including intelligence collection, intelligence analysis, interrogation, detention, and rendition. It will also require information on how many contractors are currently employed in the performance of these activities. Giving the head of the intelligence community the chance to explain the reasoning behind this widespread contracting will  allow the Congress to carefully weigh the appropriate limits for intelligence outsourcing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions are not overly prescriptive or restrictive. We fully recognize that the intelligence community needs flexibility and agility to be able to obtain and deliver to decision-makers accurate and timely intelligence about matters involving extremely high stakes. Rather, this bill gives us the tools we need to initiate a conversation about how we can better organize, manage, and oversee contractors. It is a first step toward ending the abuses of the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Chairman REYES and his colleagues on the Intelligence Committee for recognizing the importance of addressing contractor issues in the intelligence community. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the Democratic majority has taken a thoughtful and bipartisan approach to this year's Intelligence Authorization bill. I have expressed my concerns about the health of our intelligence community and appreciate the work that has been done to strengthen the Inspector General, increase contractor oversight, and invest in the training of our operatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am deeply troubled that this bill does not contain a prohibition on torture, which I believe is absolutely critical. Torture violates not only the laws and values of our country, but all standards of decent human conduct. I have consistently spoken out against the stonewalling and equivocation surrounding this administration's "interrogation" of detainees. I find it appalling that it has fallen solely to the legislative and judicial branches to set interrogation and detention standards  worthy of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet I remain hopeful that the abuses of this administration will be checked by wise and thoughtful policy. I applauded the recent "Boumediene v. Bush" Supreme Court ruling that guarantees Guantanamo Bay detainees the right of habeas corpus. Further, I believe that extending the rules of the Army Field Manual to U.S. intelligence personnel sends a clear signal that we have broken with and are rolling back the abuses of this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support a great deal of what this bill includes, yet my greatest concern is with what this bill omits. It is my hope that Congress will  come together in conference to send a message to this administration and the world at large that Americans do not approve of, and will not stand for, torture.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the revised Reyes/Murphy manager's amendment does several things. First, it makes clear that the intelligence community may enter into a contract to purchase a generally available fuel that is not an alternative or synthetic fuel or produced from a non conventional petroleum source provided that certain criteria are met. Some members of our committee were interested in addressing this issue, and we, Mr. Chairman, have done our best to handle it within the jurisdiction  of our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we included an amendment offered by Mr. Welch to require an assessment of the feasibility of employing individuals who have worked for the Federal Government in Iraq or Afghanistan as translators or interpreters. It fits very well with the committee's other reporting requirements on foreign languages. I believe it will be helpful to know whether the intelligence community can benefit from those individuals who have already served our government in Iraq or Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment makes a technical correction to a report on intelligence resources devoted to Iraq and Afghanistan. This correction is designed to ensure that the report captures both collection and analysis resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment, and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment. It was originally going to be offered by my colleague, the distinguished Republican whip. He was called to the White House, and I consider it an honor to move this amendment forward on his behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment highlights not only the absolute success of the Colombian Government in its rescue of American and Colombian hostages that had been held for years by a narcoterrorist organization, but also the clear successes of the Colombian Government's efforts after years of close cooperation with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to commend President Uribe and the Armed Forces and the National Police of Colombia on their efforts on this rescue and their many successes in implementing Plan Colombia. The amendment emphasizes the strong need to continue our close cooperation to work towards finishing the job in Colombia. We will continue to follow these issues closely and carefully in the committee, and I appreciate the Whip's efforts to focus attention on this important issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This amendment expresses congressional support of Colombia in its most recent success against the FARC. I thank the minority leader for offering it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States should support democratic nations in their efforts against violent terrorist groups such as FARC. We are all proud of the recent rescue of U.S. and Colombian hostages held by the FARC. This operation shows the strength, resourcefulness, and valor of the Colombian military. These qualities were developed through cooperation between the U.S. and Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past years, Colombia has made great strides against the FARC and greatly has reduced their strength. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported assistance to Colombia for the past decade. We must continue to do so.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is an amendment that talks about the success of the programs that we have been working on in a bipartisan basis with the Colombian Government, highlighted, of course, by the recent rescue of the American and Colombian and other hostages that had been held for years; but more importantly, we have worked in a participative way, in a collaborative way, in a number of different areas, on the diplomatic front, political front, and also on an intelligence and military front and continue  to do that, not only to free the hostages but also to make a firm statement against narcotraffickers that the Colombian Government, the U.S. Government, and others are committed to stopping the narcotraffic which is kind of performing and acting as a cancer in both the United States and Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment by Mr. Blunt that I have the privilege of offering recognizes the participation and the work of the various governments, the various agencies, and the various individuals that have enabled this program to be successful.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you travel in Latin America and you ask someone in Latin America who is America's best friend, who is America's most reliable partner and ally, they would say President Uribe of the Republic of Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here today to stand in support of this amendment that thanks America's best friend, America's most reliable and partnered ally, particularly on the war on narcotics and counterterrorism, and to thank them for the successful rescue of three Americans. And it was done without a shot being fired, without loss of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an incredible operation, an operation based on good intelligence, on good work by the Colombian military and the resources that had been made available thanks to the work of many in this Congress. That's good news, and we want to say thank you to our friend and ally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, there's a reason that President Uribe today enjoys an approval rating of almost 90 percent. He's the most popular elected official in the entire Western Hemisphere. And that's because he's made tremendous progress in dealing with the FARC and the ELN and the paramilitaries, those who have threatened the peace and security of that great nation for the last four decades. He has made tremendous progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And his record is successful. You look at it. Poverty has decreased by 10 percent. Today, 40 percent of the national budget is spent on social needs, as they made progress in bringing down violence. The murder rate has been reduced by 40 percent. In fact, for labor unionists, trade activists, trade union activists, it's down about 85 percent. Tremendous.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We saw just a few weeks ago what happened in Colombia where the Colombian military and that democratically elected government freed a number of hostages, including Americans, that had been held hostage for over 5 years. If there's ever been a time when U.S. aid has been used effectively, we saw it just a few days ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time that this Congress stop criticizing the democratically elected government of Colombia. Stop criticizing the Colombian people and start putting the blame where the blame needs to be, and that is on those murderous FARC. The Colombian Government is doing an incredible job, a wonderful job fighting those narcoterrorist thug murderers, and they're doing it with our help. It's great that we're finally going to commend them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this is just the first step. I hope we pass a free trade deal with Colombia because they deserve it. The democracy in Colombia deserves it, and we cannot turn our back.

  <chair> Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall issue a memorandum to holders of the National Intelligence Estimate entitled "Iran: Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities" regarding any intelligence on the nuclear program of Iran that has been gathered or emerged since the publication of such National Intelligence Estimate in October, 2007.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I need not be long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a straightforward, simple amendment that I hope will be without controversy. My amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act would require the Director of National Intelligence to inform all recipients of the October 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program of any new intelligence on this subject that has emerged since the publication last fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The October 2007 NIE was prepared with new and, I would say, improved procedures and provided us with insights into the status of the Iranian nuclear program. As you know, Mr. Chairman, the intelligence process is not static. This amendment is designed to ensure that Congress and others in the executive branch get the very latest information on Iran's nuclear program in a timely fashion and developed with good intelligence procedures.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this amendment. In the committee, I offered a similar amendment that would have required a revised National Intelligence Estimate on Iran. The discovery of the al Kibar facility in Syria shortly after the original National Intelligence Estimate on Iran came out clearly suggested that prior assessments with respect to proliferation should be reviewed and reevaluated and the confidence level reassessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous NIE on Iran was so poorly drafted and so seriously undermined by subsequent developments in intelligence that I thought it was necessary for the DNI to go back to the drawing board and start over. While my amendment was not successful, I believe that this amendment helps to address the issues I was attempting to raise.</paragraph>

  <chair> At the end of subtitle A of title V, add the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 506. JIHADISTS.</chair>
  <chair> None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be used to prohibit or discourage the use of the words or phrases "jihadist", "jihad", "Islamo-fascism", "caliphate", "Islamist", or "Islamic terrorist" by or within the intelligence community or the Federal Government.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>At this time, I yield myself whatever time I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to prohibit the use of funds in this bill to discourage analysts from using the words "jihadist," "jihad," "caliphate," "Islamist" or "Islamic terrorist" by or within the intelligence community or the United States Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are dealing with an enemy that speaks in no uncertain terms about its desire to attack our homeland and kill innocent Americans. In a statement released in March, Osama bin Laden said the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"God, make the mujahedin in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Islamic Maghreb, the Arabian Peninsula, Somalia, Chechnya, and everywhere victorious. God, defeat our enemies of the Jews, the Christians, and their supporters."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, in May bin Laden said the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"O youths of the generation: Jihad is the only way to liberate Palestine and al-Aqsa Mosque and to regain the orthodox caliphate, God willing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda itself uses these terms to describe its fight against America, our allies, and moderate Muslims around the world. Why then would we prohibit our intelligence professionals from using the same words to accurately describe al Qaeda's stated goals?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet that is exactly what some in Washington are attempting to do. I was dismayed to learn that over the past few months, intelligence bureaucrats at the State Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Department of Homeland Security have issued memos imposing speech codes on how their employees can describe al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups. They won't even be able to use the words these groups use themselves to describe themselves. These agencies within the intelligence  community won't be able to use those words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, free speech should not be controversial, nor should candid, accurate, and fair discussion of the self-professed goals of the terrorists that attack our homeland and have sworn to kill more Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it more than ironic that some who have complained the loudest about politicization in the intelligence community would oppose this simple amendment to prevent the politically correct politicization of our Nation's intelligence community. We all know that political correctness can be the enemy of clarity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also know that radical jihadists have made repeated efforts to stifle free speech in the West, including the murder of Dutch film maker, Theo van Gogh, and frequent death threats against authors, cartoonists, and journalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not give the radical jihadists a victory here by imposing a speech code on America's intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I will reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, which incidentally was offered in our committee but which was not agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, Members have come to this floor to talk about the need to win the hearts and minds of moderate Muslims. This was one of the central recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department have issued careful guidance to their employees saying in effect, when you see the term "jihad" to describe a violent form of terrorism, you might be alienating those moderate Muslims who want to join us in the fight against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government must consider how its words will be interpreted by its audience. If Muslims around the world hear something other than what we want to say, we will simply not achieve our goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is sensible guidance, not political correctness. Language is a strategic weapon in the war of ideas. We should, therefore, use it wisely. The administration has obviously realized this and has provided appropriate guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should not try to undermine this effort by sending contradictory messages about the use of these terms.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is the one thing that just has me scratching my head. Every day, analysts in the IC community will hear those words, "caliphate," "jihadist," "Muslim extremism," because those are the words of our enemy. And what we're telling this whole community, whose job it is to keep us informed and keep people who are going to do these intelligence investigations informed, is who they are, what they are, and how they use words, including coming up and briefing members  of the State Department, ambassadors, and other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what you're saying is no more free speech; we're going to hurt somebody's feelings. We don't want to say that terrorists are using words like "caliphate," they're using words like "jihad."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the craziest thing I have ever heard. It is political correctness that is dangerous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you ask the average American, should we shut down these people's use of the words in describing it to public officials, they will scratch their head and laugh. But that's exactly what you do when you create these artificial systems of the speech police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you want them to walk around the halls and police those who may slip and use the word "jihadist" after quoting Osama bin Laden in trying to get somebody to understand the dangers that they pose to the United States of America?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just ask my colleagues, please, use a little common sense. This surpasses any, any commonsense test you can put together when it comes to free speech, number one, and accurately communicating between the powers that be, the intelligence community and policy-makers that need to have the same language that our enemy does to understand who they are and how dangerous they are.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding to me, and I commend him and the ranking member for crafting a very good bill. Many parts of this bill that reflect work we did together in  this committee in years past, and it's wonderful that we will act on it later this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to this amendment, I rise in reluctant opposition which I want to explain. I do understand the point that we should not be engaged in political correctness or censorship. I don't think my opposition is based on either of those things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld once wrote a snowflake which asked, Are we capturing and killing them faster than they are rising up against us? The answer was no, and it's still no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does matter that we try to win the argument, and not just with the next generation who could become suicide bombers or build the next lethal generation of IEDs, but we win the argument with moderate Muslims, many of whom live in the United States and want to help us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And their guidance has gone into this guidance, published by the Homeland Security Department, which is that we not use language that inflames.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the gentleman from Michigan, there is no prohibition in this to quoting the statements of Osama bin Laden and others who use these hateful words. Why would we want to sensor that? The prohibition is directed at ourselves, words that will inflame the very communities we're trying to convince.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just close with the observation that if we had thought a little longer about using the phrase "axis of evil" we might have, it seems to me, engendered more cooperation on the part of some countries that have, sadly, moved far away from us, and engendered more cooperation on the part of populations which now look at America with disapproval.</paragraph>

If we can't use the words that our enemies use to describe themselves and their activities, when they say jihad is the only way to liberate Palestine, and we go to local law enforcement, when we go to others in America and we describe the motivations and the intentions of those who wish to do us harm, I ask my colleagues, how do you expect the intelligence community to explain the behavior or the motivation of our enemies? Do we expect the intelligence  community to say these are kind of bad people that may want to do us harm? We can't really use the words that they use to describe themselves because we've restricted the access of those words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How will America understand the nature and the character of our enemy if we can't use the words that they use to describe themselves and we need to come up with a whole new language that is totally out of context with the enemy and the nature of the threat that we face today?</paragraph>
