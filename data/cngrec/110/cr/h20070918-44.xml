    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an important effort to honor our Nation's Vietnam veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Onslow County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation in Jacksonville, North Carolina, is a nonprofit organization that was established by veterans and supporters in 1998. It was created to raise funds for the construction of a memorial to honor the brave men and women from all branches of the Armed Forces who served their country in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 9 million veterans of the Armed Forces served on active duty from August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975. Of the 3 million men and women who served in the Vietnam theater, 300,000 were wounded and more than 58,000 were killed. The Veterans Administration estimates that nearly 200 of the surviving Vietnam veterans die each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, nearly 10 years after its formation, the goal of the Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation is on the verge of becoming a reality. On the grounds of Marine Corps base Camp Lejeune, land has been acquired adjacent to the Beirut memorial, and the first phase of construction is expected to begin later this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The design of the memorial consists of a gazebo over a reflecting pool and fountain encircled by a glass wall inscribed with the names of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. Hidden within a dark gray granite base, lights will gently illuminate the engraved names on the curved glass memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once completed, the memorial will enhance the Beirut memorial and any further memorials built within the Lejeune Memorial Garden. By creating an environment where relatives and the general public can come to remember and reflect on the men and women who gave their lives in Vietnam, this memorial will attract thousands of visitors to Onslow County each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation has raised and collected about $1.2 million toward the $5 million estimated cost of the memorial. In support of this worthy project, Mr. Kenji Horn and others who believe in this memorial have organized a fund-raising motorcycle run in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on Saturday, September 22 of this year. It is open to everyone, and all types of motorcycles are welcome. Registrations have come in from Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky,  and other States around the country; and more than 1,500 motorcycles are expected to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in today's world, we all are aware of the debt of this Nation, and we understand the reality that most worthwhile projects must be funded by the private sector. So it is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that people from around this Nation will be interested in learning more about the Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation. Our Vietnam veterans have earned this honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I close, Mr. Speaker, by saying, please God, continue to bless our men and women in uniform, and please, God, continue to bless America.</paragraph>
