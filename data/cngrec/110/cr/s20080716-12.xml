  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wished to address this issue which both the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, have talked about; that is, high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very real problem for Americans throughout the country. High gas prices today, the high price of home heating fuels as we approach the fall and winter, particularly natural gas prices which are expected to be much higher this winter; propane prices; and home heating oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as I am sure we are all aware, there has been a lot of politics mixed in with the debate about what we ought to be doing to try to deal with and help solve this problem. I hope we can put that behind us and get onto a substantive discussion of the concrete steps that would make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most agree there are three areas we might constructively address in the very near term in the Congress. I hope we are able to address all three. The first is the one Senator Reid was talking about earlier, and that is, the proper functioning of energy markets or the so-called problem of speculation in our markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second, of course, is how do we reduce our demand for oil. Everyone recognizes that part of the high price of gas is the increasing demand for oil, and the United States is a significant participant in increasing demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third item is the increasing of supply which needs to be part of the solution as well, in my view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of proper functioning of the markets, Senator Reid pointed out that as majority leader he has now put forward a piece of legislation which we hope can gain bipartisan support and we hope can be addressed in the Senate in the very near future. It takes some of the ideas that have come from the Republican side of the aisle, and some of the ideas that have come from the Democratic side of the aisle, and tries to meld these two into a piece of legislation that will do some real  good in taking speculation out of the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is a lot of dispute as to what extent there is speculation affecting the price of oil. But most experts say the increased speculation in commodity markets is one factor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of demand reduction, there are a lot of ideas also around the Congress as to things we might do. The President has not spoken about demand reduction, at least I have not heard him say anything about that. He has not spoken about the issue of speculation in the markets either or urged action there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think the Congress ought to try to address both to speculation issue and demand reduction. Third, we ought to try to do something on the issue of increasing supply. Now, the President has made this his sole issue that requires attention, as I understand his recent statements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He specifically has said the current ban on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf is what needs to be changed, that is the one thing standing between the American people and a lower price for gas at the pump. Now, 2 days ago, he took action to revoke the Presidential withdrawal of this Outer Continental Shelf land and challenged Congress to act similarly in the immediate future before the August recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me try to put some facts out for people to understand on this general issue. Before doing so, I ask unanimous consent that my total time allowed be 20 minutes as part of morning business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>This first map tries to make the point as to what we are talking about. We are all talking about the OCS, the Outer Continental Shelf. There are four areas that constitute the OCS. It is an area 200 miles going out from the U.S. coast all around the  country, on the east coast, the west coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and all around Alaska. Those are the four areas that contain Outer Continental Shelf lands. These are submerged lands owned by  the Federal Government. They have always been owned by the Federal Government. There is no dispute about that. States have rights going 3 miles out into the Outer Continental Shelf but after that, the Federal Government controls those lands. That is the OCS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we should be drilling more in the Outer Continental Shelf, where does that resource lie? The Minerals Management Service, which is part of our Department of the Interior in this administration, says their best calculation at this point is that 44.9 billion barrels of oil are in the Gulf of Mexico; that is 52 percent. Another 31 percent is not in the Gulf of Mexico, it is around the area of Alaska. On the east coast, there is 4 percent of what we believe exists in the way of oil in the OCS;  and on the west coast, 12 percent. That is their best estimate at the current time. On natural gas, it is even a larger amount in the Gulf; there is about the same amount in Alaska as there is oil percentage-wise, 31 percent; and you can see natural gas is 4 percent on the Pacific coast and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Atlantic coast is estimated to contain only 4 percent of the oil and 9 percent of the natural gas, and the Pacific coast is estimated to contain 12 percent of the oil and 4 percent of the natural gas. That is the basic information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the proposal that Senator McConnell and President Bush have put forward to try to deal with this problem? First, let's talk about what they have not proposed. They have not proposed any change in the Gulf of Mexico. They have said, leave the law as it is in the Gulf of Mexico. There is no proposed lifting of any ban there. Second, they have not proposed anything with regard to the area of second most promise, and that is around Alaska, because there is no moratorium to be lifted  up there. Third, they have said as to the two areas that have the least resource as far as we know, the east and west coasts, that we should give the Governors and the State legislatures of the coastal States the authority to decide whether there is to be any drilling off</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been characterized, both by the President and the media, as giving the States a say. That is not what the legislation calls for. This legislation calls for giving the legislatures and the Governors a veto over development off their coasts. That is an unprecedented action by this Congress to say, OK, this is Federal land. This is a Federal resource. We are trying to craft a national energy policy. The way we want to go about it is to give each State legislature and each Governor the ability  to veto development off their particular coast. I think that is a terrible idea. I have spoken many times about this. I hope the Congress will not agree to go along with the idea that we shift this responsibility and authority to the State level. That is a point people need to keep clearly in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe strongly that there are several categories of land that are not subject to the drilling ban, not subject to any moratoria, where we could be producing more oil and gas. I wish to go through that list and explain it a little bit. The first area is drilling leases that are not producing oil. We know for a fact that most of the area that has been leased is not producing oil. Here is a chart that says 83 percent of the leased area in the OCS is not producing energy. There may be good and  sufficient reasons why the companies that lease that land are not producing oil from it, but I believe we need to ensure that there is diligent development of existing leases. I don't know that that is the case. We wrote a letter to Secretary Kempthorne--30 Senators signed the letter--urging him to look into this and see if more can</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second area on this chart is leases offered but not taken by oil companies. Here again, the current 5-year plan includes a sale every year in the central and western Gulf of Mexico. We had a recent sale in this lease sale 181 area that Congress legislated on in 2006, near the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The fact is, for much of the land offered for leasing--two companies at the time--MMS received no bids. We need to get to the bottom of that and figure out why, when we offer this land for lease,  companies are not coming forward and actually</paragraph>
    <paragraph>bidding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also talk about this third area which is areas scheduled to be leased but not yet leased. The administration has done what previous administrations have done, and that is to have a 5-year schedule of leases. We have a 5-year schedule in place now. The lease sale I referred to in March was part of that 5-year schedule. I believe there are 16 additional lease sales scheduled in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. All of those are on this chart on the right, scheduled lease sales. We need to  look at that and ask: Is this an ambitious enough schedule of lease sales? Do we believe there is a greater appetite by the oil industry than this reflects? Do we believe that if we put up more land for leasing, we would get more production more quickly? If so, we should consider doing this. I don't see any reason why the Bush administration couldn't offer a more ambitious plan in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final category is areas that are not in the moratorium. They are subject to no moratorium for drilling, and also they are not in the 5-year plan. So they are not scheduled to be leased in the future either. We have a chart here on Alaska. Most of the area I am talking about is the Outer Continental Shelf that surrounds Alaska. You can see it is a very large area. Of course, we claim our right to drill and to ownership of the submerged lands way out around the Aleutian Islands. All of this  is part of the Outer Continental Shelf. What this chart shows is that there are 918 million acres in the Outer Continental Shelf around Alaska that are open for drilling but have not been included in the administration's 5-year plan. So of the area in the Outer Continental Shelf in Alaska that is not covered by moratoria, about 15 percent is included in the administration's 5-year plan. The other 85 percent is areas not covered. I would think the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these things I have on this list are ways to increase oil production that do not require any change with regard to who is going to control access to the Outer Continental Shelf. As I indicated, that would be a big mistake to grant that authority to State legislatures and Governors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me summarize by going back and asking, what should we do, what should we as the Congress do in the coming weeks? And I hope what we are able to do. First, we should deal with speculation. Senator Reid has a proposal in that regard. I hope it can get bipartisan support, and we can move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we should do all we can to encourage more reduction in demand. There are a lot of good ideas around, from Republicans, from Democrats, from experts on all sides on that subject. We are having a workshop tomorrow in our Energy and Natural Resources Committee where some of these ideas will undoubtedly be discussed, as well as ideas related to supply. We are also going to have a hearing next week on the subject of demand reduction and possible changes in policy that could help. Then we should</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, if companies have the ability and the desire to develop more leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, we should accelerate leasing in areas that are not covered by the moratoria, and there are a lot of them, as I think these charts have made clear. There are a lot of areas outside the moratoria that could be leased under current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, if the administration knows of particular areas they believe have great promise and would like us to go ahead and open to leasing and that currently are not covered, I would be anxious to have them present the evidence and tell us what those are. We put a provision in the 2005 Energy bill, which many of us worked on, calling for a comprehensive inventory of OCS oil and natural gas resources. It called on the Secretary to do that. The Secretary did do a report, an inventory. He gave it  to us in 2006. Unfortunately, what we said in the legislation was that the Secretary should use all available technology, any technology except drilling, including 3-D seismic technology, to obtain accurate resource estimates. The administration chose not to do that. They did not ask us for the funds to do that. So the report they gave us in 2006 does not have the benefit of any 3-D seismic</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of progress we can make on a bipartisan basis. We need to quit suggesting that the solution to high gas prices is taking what has always been a Federal decision--that is, who is going to have access to the Outer Continental Shelf and under what circumstances--and give it to the State legislatures and Governors. That would be a major mistake. I hope we do not go that route. There are things we can do on speculation. There are things we can do on demand reduction. There are things  we can do on increased supply which I hope will help alleviate this very real problem Americans are faced with.</paragraph>
