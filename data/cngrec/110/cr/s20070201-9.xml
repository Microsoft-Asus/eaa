  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the majority leader mentioned the baseball career of my colleague from Kentucky, JIM BUNNING, and we are immensely proud of him in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not only as a great U.S. Senator but also somebody who literally put our State on the map during his athletic career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say to these young pages here, Senator Bunning is not only a hall of famer in baseball, he is a hall of famer in life. He has 9 wonderful children, 35 grandchildren, maybe even some beyond that. So it is an extraordinary Kentucky family, and I wish to acknowledge with gratitude the observations the majority leader made of my colleague, Senator Bunning.</paragraph>
