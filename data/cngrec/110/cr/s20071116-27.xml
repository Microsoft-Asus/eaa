  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be coming in for pro forma sessions during the Thanksgiving holiday to prevent recess appointments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that this will prompt the President to see that it is in our mutual interests for the nominations process to get back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While an election year looms, significant progress can still be made on nominations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to making that progress if the President will meet me halfway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that progress can't be made if the President seeks controversial recess appointments and fails to make Democratic appointments to important commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Democratic leader, I recommend nominees to the President for many important commissions like the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These independent agencies are required by law to have Democratic representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, the President has a statutory obligation to honor my recommendations and move on them in good faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, up until recently, the President has generally discharged that obligation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last several months, however, the administration has been stalling progress on Democratic appointments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This problem existed before the August break.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to solve it, I worked hard to confirm over 40 administration nominees in exchange for a commitment by the President to make progress on a number of important commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we reconvened after the August break, I also worked to quickly move on the President's new Attorney General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did this despite my own opposition to that nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with all this hard work on our side, the commitments the administration made to me before the August break were not met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the almost 3 months since that break, we have received no Democratic nominees to full-time commission positions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some, in fact, absolutely no discernible progress has been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Thanksgiving break looming, the administration informed me that they would make several recess appointments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I indicated I would be willing to confirm various appointments if the administration would agree to move on Democratic appointments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They would not make that commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, I am keeping the Senate in pro forma to prevent recess appointments until we get this process back on track.</paragraph>
