  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, each May, our Nation pays tribute to the contribution older Americans have made to our great country as many communities all across our great Nation come together to celebrate Older Americans Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having grown up in eastern Arkansas in a small community, the daughter of a farmer, I was within walking distance of both my grandparents. I learned incredible lessons from them that I still carry with me today. I imagine there are many of my Senate colleagues who can stop and think about a wonderful memory of growing up with grandparents or maybe an older aunt or uncle who lived nearby, perhaps it was a favorite schoolteacher or a mentor in the community or in their neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pride and dedication older Americans have had for our country was impressed upon me from a very early age, from all of those different figures in my life--my grandparents, obviously, but also from wonderful teachers, as well as neighbors, those who shared their stories with me, they shared their values with me, they helped me become the person I am today. Whether it was hearing about my grandfathers' service in World War I--both of them having served as infantrymen in World War I--or maybe  it was the jar my grandmother left on the mantelpiece that stored the coins during the Great Depression or the story of my neighbor who, during World War II, flew over "the hump" and did tremendous feats in World War II, so many people who have affected my life. Again, I am sure that if any Senator takes the time, they will remember their lives have been affected as well by an individual just like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though I didn't know it, I was a caregiver at an early age when it was one of my and my cousin's tasks to take dinner, nightly meals over to our grandparents' house. Later in my life, when my grandmother was ill and lived with us in our home and I shared a room with her, that time spent with my grandparents and with others, other elderly people in my community and in my neighborhood--they were priceless for both of us. Not only was I able to give something of my energy and my experiences  in the current time, but it was wonderful also for her, my grandmother, who lived with us, because she was able to share her experiences and values with me, and I was able to learn so many of life's lessons from her and from the others in my community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's world is so much different. Even though we no longer live within walking distance of our parents or grandparents, my husband Steve and I make a very conscious effort to ensure that our children spend quality time with their grandparents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems appropriate, then, during Older Americans Month that I rise this morning to draw attention to a piece of legislation that I and my good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who has been on the Senate floor earlier this morning, have introduced that seeks to protect millions of older Americans. It is the Elder Justice Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to note that Chairman Kohl and ranking member GORDON SMITH of the Senate Special Committee on Aging have been champions of this legislation as well, and I certainly appreciate all they do in bringing about both support as well as knowledge of this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been a cosponsor of the Elder Justice Act since it was originally introduced in 2002, and I helped pass a version of this bill out of the Senate Finance Committee in 2004, in 2005, and again in 2006. Unfortunately, the Elder Justice Act has yet to become law despite the fact that our Nation continues to grow older and despite the fact that the tragedy of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard for any of us to imagine that our elderly loved ones would be victim to those types of actions, the abuse or neglect or exploitation that exists in this country. We have held hearings on elder abuse for almost 25 years. Yet not one single Federal employee works full time on this issue. We are beginning to make progress. I encourage all my colleagues to join me, not only in this month when we celebrate the wonderful heritage of older Americans, but to ensure that we move a piece of  legislation that will protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives recently held its first hearing on this issue in 17 years--thanks to the hard work of Congressman RAHM EMMANUEL and PETER KING--and the Elder Justice Act is currently going through the committee markup in that body. In addition to adding cosponsors, we are looking for opportunities to pass this legislation this year in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abuse of our senior citizens can be physical, it can be sexual, it can be psychological, or it can be financial. The perpetrator may be a stranger, it may be an acquaintance, it may be a paid caregiver, it might be a corporation and, sadly, even a spouse or another family member. We have an obligation to the older Americans of this country not to sit around for another 25 years but to come up with the solutions that already exist for so many other Americans. Elder abuse happens everywhere and  at all levels of income and in all geographic areas, whether you live in an urban area or out on a county road in rural America. No matter how rich you are, and no matter where you live, no one is immune. When we say no one is immune, it means none of our loved ones are immune from this horrific act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must make our seniors a priority and pass the Elder Justice Act as soon as possible. This bill represents a consensus agreement developed by the Elder Justice Coalition, a national coalition of 547 members, including 226 organizations and 321 individuals, dedicated to eliminating elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation in this great country of ours. This bill reminds us that Congress has already passed comprehensive bills to address child abuse and violence against women but has continued  to ignore the fact that we have no Federal law enacted to date on elder abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made great strides. I know, as cochairman of the Senate Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, we have made great strides in how we can better protect our children from exploitation and from all the different fears and dangers that are out there. Why would we not want to do this for the wonderful elderly people of this country who have given all of us so very much?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every older American has the right to enjoy his or her golden years free of abuse and neglect. As Americans age--and I know and many of us know from personal experience--they want to maintain their independence and their dignity and their pride. It is very difficult when they become exploited or abused or neglected. It is hard for them to reach out and ask for help and care, particularly of their children. It is not something easy for them to do. It is why we have the responsibility in the Senate  to do something about elder abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Elder Justice Act will enhance our knowledge about abuse of our seniors in all of its terrible forms. It will elevate elder abuse to the national stage. We cannot solve this problem if we do not understand it, we do not know how it occurs, and we do not begin to use the tools we have already to protect the seniors of this country. Too many of our seniors suffer needlessly. Each year anywhere between  500,000 and 5 million seniors in our country are  abused. They are abused, neglected, or exploited, and, sadly, most of those abuses go unreported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historical problem will only worsen as 77 million baby boomers begin to age. The Elder Justice Act confronts elder abuse in the same way we combat child abuse and violence against women--through law enforcement, public health programs, and social services at all levels of government. We are not talking about reinventing the wheel, we are talking about using what we have learned in the abuse of children and in the abuse of women and applying those tools to one of our greatest blessings, the  elderly of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes research projects to assist in the development of future legislation. The Elder Justice Act will take steps to make older Americans safer in their own homes, in nursing home facilities, in neighborhoods all across this country. It enhances the detection of elder abuse, and it helps seniors recover from abuse after it happens. It increases collaboration between Federal agencies and between Federal, State, local, and private entities, law enforcement, long-term care facilities,  consumer advocates, and families to prevent and treat elder abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, all of them, to remember those individuals in your life, certainly in your communities, and others who have given so much to this country, whether it was somebody years ago who helped to build this great Nation through education as a teacher, perhaps, an educator; maybe it was building our economy in this country by building a great company or a great effort there; perhaps it was a soldier from years past who defended the rights of this country and our freedoms today. Look  back and consider the special people in your life, such as an elderly neighbor or a grandparent. I know there is not a day that goes by in my life that I don't think about those people who have so tremendously affected my life, who have taught me values, and who have shared stories with me, who have helped me become who I am. Each one of us needs to stop and think of those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe it was a teacher in the first grade. Maybe it was a coach. Maybe it was a music instructor. Maybe it was a Sunday school teacher. Maybe it was a police officer. I think of all those different people who have made a difference in my life, and I want to ensure that as a nation we respect their safety and their ability to live in this country with dignity and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all my colleagues will consider whomever those special people were in their lives, who helped support their dreams, provided wisdom, perhaps, and advice throughout their development--there are millions out there--and each one of us needs to take the time to remember them. It is time for Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to address elder abuse and protect those in their twilight of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to take a look in this month of May, when we look in respect and admiration to the older Americans of this country, and provide the kind of law that we have provided for children and for women to protect them from abuse and exploitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
