    <paragraph>I commend the Republican leader for his willingness to work with us in getting an agreement where we debated two stem cell bills. I also would be remiss if I did not mention the primary individuals who were here during most, if not all, of that debate: Senators Harkin, Specter, Brownback, Coleman, and Isakson. They conducted the debate in a manner which shows Members can disagree and not be disagreeable. Although there were different points of view, the debate was clearly very informative  and educational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we just entered an order allowing the Senate to consider the Intelligence authorization bill on Monday. There will be a cloture vote on that bill at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will not be in session on Friday. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes.</paragraph>
