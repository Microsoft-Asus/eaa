  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 93rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, which, sadly, was the first genocide of the 20th century, a template for a cycle of genocide that continues to occur to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Armenian Genocide involved the issue of man's injustice to mankind. It continued to occur throughout the 20th century, as we know, in the Holocaust, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and now in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing up in Fresno, California, as we proudly say, the land of William Saroyan, I heard many stories as a young man from the grandparents of our neighbors, the Kezerians, the Koligians and the Abramhian families, about being forced to leave their homes and farms, the stories of long marches and systematic murders. They believe it was the first genocide of the 20th century, and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I believe it was too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Genocide is not something that can simply be swept under the rug and forgotten. The United States cannot continue its policy of denial regarding the Armenian genocide, and I encourage that we once again reconsider the passage of <bill type="hr" number="106">H. Res. 106</bill> to recognize the Armenian genocide.</paragraph>
