    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="hj" number="70">H.J. Res. 70</bill>, which commemorates 2008 as the centennial of the United States Army Reserve, celebrating the historic contributions of its veterans and continuing contributions of its soldiers to operations at home and abroad. I thank my colleague, Mr. Bishop of Georgia, for introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 9, 1905, the 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, dispatched a special message to the Senate and the House of Representatives recommending passage of legislation to establish a Federal Reserve force of trained personnel to bring our Army to its highest point of efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning as a supplementary unit at the turn of the 20th century, our Army Reserve soldiers have shown immeasurable dedication and valor through the broadening of their inceptive purpose. The Army Reserve has developed from a few support troops during World War I into a vital and sustained operational force for current and future operations. This Federal force has been deployed in different capacities, serving in eight wars and defending the interests of the United States and its allies in World  War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Russia, Berlin, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kenya, Iraq and numerous humanitarian missions in other countries during its first 100 years. Involvement in operations Desert Storm, Desert Shield, Joint Endeavor, Joint Guard, Enduring Freedom, Noble Eagle, and Iraqi Freedom shows the Army is incomplete without the skilled and trained personnel of its Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army Reserve has grown from 160 medical officers to virtually 200,000 soldiers who play a major role in the defense of our Nation and who continue in the furtherance of the United States defense interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this moment approximately 50,000 of our Nation's Army Reserve soldiers are serving on active duty around the world. These men and women voluntarily put their civilian careers and family lives on hold. And in most cases, they do so for over a year which is a testament to their selflessness, patriotism, and willingness to sacrifice for the good of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, I am extremely proud of all of our Armed Forces: the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps and the National Guard. Our entire military continues to work diligently in a time of conflict, and deserves the highest respect for their courage in the face of adversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hj" number="70">H.J. Res. 70</bill> is our way, as the United States Congress, of recognizing the centennial of our Army Reserve, a force that our institution played a role in creating 100 years ago. This resolution honors the sacrifice and tremendous distinction of the millions of American men and women who have served as Army soldiers since April 23, 1908.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I again thank our colleague from Georgia (Mr. Bishop) for his initiative in bringing us together today to recognize and honor the Army Reserve on the occasion of its 100th anniversary, and I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412255" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Joint Resolution 70, as amended, which congratulates the Army Reserve on its centennial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are over 340 Army reservists in Virginia's First Congressional District, and over 150 have been mobilized in support of the global war on terror. Ever since 1908 when the Army Reserve began as a means to increase the efficiency of the Army Medical Corps, the Army Reserve and its soldiers have stepped up magnificently to every challenge and mission presented to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those challenges span the breadth of the American wars in the past 100 years. In World War I, 169,500 Army reservists served; in World War II, 200,000, including 29 percent of the Army's officer corps; in Korea, 240,500; in Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 94,000. And since September 11, 2001, 147,000 Army reservists have been mobilized in support of the global war on terror; 110,000 have deployed, 39,000 have served multiple deployments, and 102 have died in the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army reservists are citizen soldiers active in 1,100 communities across the Nation. They are the sons and daughters, mothers and fathers of America. They are remarkable in many respects, but no more so than their willingness to serve this Nation in a professional and unselfish manner. They continue to serve today knowing that they will likely be deployed away from home, family and civilian employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many in America, the patriotism, commitment, and sacrifice of these remarkable citizens called Army reservists goes unnoticed. I believe every effort should be made to highlight and acknowledge their service to a grateful Nation. So it is entirely proper and fitting that we take this moment not only to mark an historical milestone of 100 years of service to the Nation by the Army Reserve, but also to honor those soldiers past and present who have served and are serving so honorably as well  as Army reservists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the original sponsor of this joint resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm honored to sponsor this bipartisan resolution, along with Representatives Buyer, Shimkus and Taylor, to congratulate the United States Army Reserve on its 100th anniversary, which will be formally celebrated on April 23, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution, which has 260 cosponsors, also commemorates the contributions of Army Reserve veterans who've helped to ensure that the United States' vital national security interests are protected and defended in times of war and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very gratified by the outpouring of bipartisan support that this resolution has received. It's indicative of the high regard and esteem in which the Army Reserve is held among Members of Congress and the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a current member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, as well as the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Committee, I've been extremely impressed by the level of commitment that Army Reserve soldiers bring to their work, and by their high degree of professionalism. They truly are "twice the citizen," as Winston Churchill once remarked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the U.S. Army Reserve is composed of more than 30,000 officers and 150,000 enlisted soldiers. They have an active presence in 1,100 communities across our Nation, contributing military values, important job skills, and economic support. They are husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They are our neighbors, our friends, our acquaintances and our colleagues at work. These soldiers can be called up at any time to serve our Nation, and they must be trained and prepared  to respond at a moment's notice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in the House of Representatives, 24 Members, including myself, have been privileged to serve in the Reserves. In fact, two of the lead sponsors of this resolution, Representatives Steve Buyer and John Shimkus, still serve in the Army Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this resolution notes, the role of today's Army Reserve soldier has expanded and changed dramatically since President Roosevelt first requested that Congress establish a reserve of trained officers. On April 23, 1908, Congress responded to the President's request by establishing a permanent reserve corps of trained medical officers. The modest corps represented the humble start of what is today a multi-faceted operational and strategic force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, their duties have expanded. The Army Reserve is now an integral component in any active U.S. Army mission. They have answered the call of duty in World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, Panama, the Gulf War, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo and, of course, since September 11, 2001, in Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through October 31, 2007, 102 Army Reserve soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since then, an additional four Reserve officers have lost their lives in combat. We dedicate this resolution to their memory and to the memory of all Reserve soldiers who fought and died defending our Nation's freedoms throughout our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We dedicate this resolution to our living heroes as well, to those men and women who continue their service to our Nation in the U.S. Army Reserve today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend several staff members for the outstanding work in bringing this resolution to the floor: Kevin Coughlin, Joe Hicken and John Chapla on the House Armed Services Committee, Tim Welter and Abel Carreiro on Congressman Buyer's staff, Grant Culp from Congressman Shimkus' staff, Randy Jennings on Congressman Taylor's staff, David Whitney on the House Judiciary Committee, Lieutenant General Jack C. Stultz and Lieutenant Colonel Rob Young of the Army Reserve,  and Jonathan Halpern and Ed Larkin on my staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I, again, thank my colleagues who are cosponsors for their extraordinary support of this resolution, and I urge its immediate adoption.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as the Army Reserve celebrates its centennial, I rise to congratulate the Reserve on its dedicated service and sacrifice to ensure our Nation's freedom. Since its inception on April 23, 1908, the Reserve and its more than 1 million citizen-soldiers have protected American citizens at home and abroad. When tyranny raises its fist and liberty is threatened, the citizen-soldier answers the call to ease the suffering. For this, our Nation is forever grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 20,000 Army Reserve soldiers are deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 18 other countries, with an additional 7,000 Army Reserve serving in the United States. In my home State of Minnesota, historic Fort Snelling is the proud home to the 88th Regional Readiness Command, comprised of Reserve units from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. America's greatness lies in her people, and the American soldier is the embodiment of hard work, patriotism and service,  the finest of America's principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize today the selfless commitment and sacrifice of so many citizen-soldiers. It is they who lay down their lives to defend those who cannot defend themselves. It is they who lay down their lives to protect the rights of those who disrespect our flag and our Nation. And it is they who lay down their lives so that true freedom will never know extinction. As April 23 approaches, let us remember and be forever grateful for the Army Reserve's 100 years of noble  service and sacrifice to our Nation.</paragraph>
