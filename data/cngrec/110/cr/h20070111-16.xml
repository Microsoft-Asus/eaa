    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last night President Bush accepted responsibility for the failures in Iraq. Yet he offered no real strategy for winning the war in Iraq or the broader struggle with terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many military and foreign policy experts, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have acknowledged that the President's proposal to increase troop strength is not a solution to the ongoing instability in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that an influx of troops will actually worsen the situation on the ground. Not only that, but redeploying 20,000 additional troops in Iraq will stretch our already fully deployed Armed Forces even further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned that deploying additional troops will significantly hinder our ability to effectively combat the global terrorist threat. In fact, the very consideration of redeploying troops in Iraq means that we are distracted from the wider war on terrorism, especially in Afghanistan where additional forces may be necessary to rein in al Qaeda and the Taliban.</paragraph>
