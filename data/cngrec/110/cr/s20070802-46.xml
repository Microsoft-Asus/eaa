    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the Georgia O'Keefe Museum in Santa Fe, NM, on its 10th anniversary. Georgia O'Keefe was, and remains, a New Mexico institution. The work she did while living in my State is held in the highest regard by artists and spectators alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgia O'Keefe settled in New Mexico in 1945 after being a frequent visitor of the State seeking artistic inspiration. She is famous for her vibrant portrayals of flowers and unique New Mexico landscapes. Ms. O'Keefe has inspired a number of aspiring artists, and she is sure to inspire many more for many years. Her work is timeless. New Mexico is proud to be home to most of her prized work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Georgia O'Keefe Museum is the first museum dedicated to the work of a woman artist of international stature. It showcases well over 1,000 pieces of Ms. O'Keefe's work. The museum has opened its doors to over one million visitors just in its first few years of operation; countless others will enjoy it in the future. It also boasts a vast education and outreach program that includes internships, teacher workshops, seminars and even afterschool arts programs. The museum is dedicated to the study  and interpretation of her work, as well as American modernism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The museum will commemorate the anniversary with a 10th anniversary celebration. The celebration will include a dinner dance, entertainment, and obviously art. The event will not only commemorate Georgia O'Keefe but also honor the museum's founders, Anne and John Marion. They have worked tirelessly to see that the artwork of Ms. O'Keefe is available for all to enjoy. Through their vision, the work of Georgia O'Keefe will be available for study and viewing for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend these two individuals for envisioning a place for Georgia O'Keefe's work to be displayed, and maintaining that vision for the last 10 years. I believe Ms. O'Keefe would be proud of the work they have done and honored to be held in such high regard with respect to her art.</paragraph>
