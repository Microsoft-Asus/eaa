    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Canova, SD. The town of Canova will commemorate the 125th anniversary of its founding with celebrations July 4 to 5, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Miner County, Canova was founded in 1883 and was named after Italian sculptor Antonio Canova. Since its beginning 125 years ago, the community of Canova has continued to serve as a strong example of South Dakota traditions, especially in its outstanding amateur baseball team, the Canova Gang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Canova on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
