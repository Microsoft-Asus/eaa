  <narrative>EARMARK TRANSPARENCY -- (Senate - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9295">S9295</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak now about the ongoing efforts in the Senate to block the earmark transparency rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has now been 180 days since they were unanimously adopted by the Senate. Yet they still have not been formally enacted. Even worse, the majority wants to take them behind closed doors, where a conference committee can kill them in secret. They tried to kill these reforms on the Senate floor but failed. Now they are falling back to their plan B, which is to gut them in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not how we should write a bill about openness, honesty, and transparency. I hope my friends on the other side will change their minds. These are Senate rules I am talking about, and there is no reason why we need to negotiate with the House. The House already has their earmark transparency rules. My friends on the other side should stop blocking earmark reform and stop trying to change these rules in secret so we can move on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans have seen the ethical problems associated with earmarks. They have watched what happened to Duke Cunningham, and they have seen a number of Members of Congress forfeit their seats on appropriations committees due to conflicts of interest. Americans understand that lobbying and ethics reform will not be complete--in fact, it would be meaningless--if we don't do something to shine the light on earmarks. Let me repeat this because I think it is very important. Americans do understand that  ethics reform is not complete without meaningful earmark reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the reforms in the ethics bill address what people outside of Congress can do, but earmark reform  addresses what we here in Congress can do. That is the difference. Americans want, more than anything else, Congress to be restrained and open about what we do. They want us to reform the way we spend their money and shut down the secret congressional favor factory. Nothing would do more to restore America's faith in their Government than enacting reforms that ensure their elected officials are not going to use their ability to spend Federal dollars to enrich their friends and supporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to an article that ran this morning in The Hill newspaper about earmarks--earmarks that have not been properly disclosed. The majority likes to say they are complying with the rules, but that doesn't appear to be the case. This story says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a proposal to require full disclosure of all Senate earmarks languishes, Senators have not claimed responsibility for at least $7.5 billion worth of projects approved by the Appropriations Committee, according to an analysis by a budget watchdog group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, the piecemeal approach being used by the Democrats is not working. We cannot allow appropriators and other committees to police themselves. They are not doing it now, and they never will. We need a single enforcement rule for the whole Senate that doesn't keep loopholes for secret earmarking. Let me repeat: $7.5 billion in earmarks already this year are undisclosed. This is business as usual in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to point out that the Defense authorization bill we are debating now violates the rules. It discloses the earmark sponsors, but the committee failed to post on the Internet the letters from these sponsors certifying that they do not have a financial interest in the earmark they have requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I conclude, I want to update the Senate on some progress we are making on earmark reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we have added several cosponsors to <bill type="sr" number="123">S. Res. 123</bill>, which is the earmark disclosure rule. They are Senators ENSIGN, ENZI, MARTINEZ, COBURN, MCCASKILL, and CORNYN. I thank them for their support. Some of these Senators request earmarks, while others do not. But they all support earmark disclosure, and they all support this rule as it is written right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also added a couple cosponsors to <bill type="sr" number="260">S. Res. 260</bill>, the rule that would stop the adding of earmarks in secret conference committees. They are Senators ALLARD and CORNYN. I thank them for their support. A select few Members of Congress and their staffs should not be adding hidden earmarks to bills in the middle of the night when no one has the opportunity to review them and debate their merits. That is very bad practice, and it must end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was also an important editorial last Tuesday in the Roll Call newspaper that supports our efforts to protect earmark reform. I will read a couple of excerpts:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Democratic leaders are resisting [Senator DeMint's] move and are insisting on going to conference on the ethics bill, although they have yet to explain why already agreed-upon earmark rules can't be adopted immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't oppose earmarks in principle. ..... But as events last year amply demonstrated, earmarks can be a source of rotten corruption. Full disclosure is crucial, and the Senate ought to institute it forthwith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think that on the merits Senate leaders should accede to DeMint so disclosure of spending requests is not delayed until President Bush signs an ethics reform measure that still has not even gone to a House-Senate conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the blogging community is watching what we are doing here. Countless bloggers, including The Corner on National Review Online, Instapundit.com, MichelleMalkin.com, the Sunlight Foundation, Porkbusters.com, RedState.com, and many others, have weighed in on the need for the Senate to implement these earmark transparency rules now. I thank them for paying attention to this debate and working to hold us all accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we have received letters of support from several important taxpayer watchdog groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Citizens Against Government Waste. These groups know how important earmark reform is, and they believe it should be implemented immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These rules need to be adopted immediately. They should not be allowed to go to conference with the House where they can be changed at will. They need to be enacted now before a single appropriations bill comes to the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been 180 days since they were unanimously adopted by the Senate. I have asked consent to enact these rules four times, but the other side has blocked them each and every time. Today needs to be the day that this obstruction stops. Today needs to be the day we end the earmark business as usual in the Senate.</paragraph>
