  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="WELCH" of="Vermont">
    <paragraph>The question before the House today is really very simple: Will the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the world, pass legislation that guarantees access to health care for all the children of the citizens of this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our States, including Vermont, have taken the lead. They answered that question in the affirmative: The children of working parents, children whose parents are doing the right thing, should have the health care they need when they need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That has been done on a bipartisan basis. Republican and Democratic Governors in my State of Vermont have supported access to health care for our kids; 98 percent are covered in Vermont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is it that this Congress has been unable to take that step until today? We will change that. It is the right thing to do. It is good for our kids. It is good for our country. It is well within the reach of this Congress to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I hope that our friends on the Republican side will join us in what will be a historic day for our kids.</paragraph>
