    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, instead of praising and encouraging our troops in their relentless fight against the terrorist insurgents and seeing the success of U.S. troops, some choose to focus on the negative. They seem to preach gloom, doom and despair. They come across as defeatists, retreatists, and losers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do these people really want us to lose this war? Is their retreat political agenda more important than America's safety agenda? Now is the time, more than ever, that this Nation be behind our soldiers in this fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dangers to freedom do exist. Right now in Afghanistan, Taliban forces are holding 22 civilians from a South Korean church. They have executed one hostage and plan to murder more. These Islamic radicals kill in the name of religion. Now, what would the surrender advocates have us do? Hide?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fanatical militants are a threat to the security of free nations and the United States. It is the American troops, however, that are making a difference in beating back the forces of hatred and oppression. Our patriots deserve thanks, respect and our total commitment, not naysayers' words of criticism, contempt and complaining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
