  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 391, recognizing the employees of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the North Texas Commission, the USO, and the people and businesses of North Texas for their dedication to the "Welcome Home a Hero" program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Welcome Home a Hero" program is a daily gathering of volunteers to celebrate the homecoming of soldiers returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tremendous effort has made the "Welcome Home a Hero" program one of the largest ongoing community service efforts in North Texas; and these committed employees have given of their time so that our troops, as well as their families, can be welcomed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 12, the 500,000th soldier will come home for a well-deserved 2 weeks of rest and recuperation, and I'm proud to share that the "Welcome Home a Hero" program in the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport has been selected by the U.S. military to host this celebration; and, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for support when this resolution comes up. I know we couldn't do it today, but I extend my personal gratitude to the program's volunteers for their efforts in supporting our dedicated men  and women in uniform who are proudly serving our Nation.</paragraph>
