  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="RECOGNIZING LOUISBURG COLLEGE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Louisburg College, one of North Carolina's fine institutions of higher learning, on the occasion of its celebration of 220 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisburg College is the oldest chartered 2-year, church-related, coeducational college in the Nation and can trace its roots back to the early years of the town of Louisburg, NC. The town was founded in 1779, during the Revolutionary War, and was named in honor of King Louis XVI of France. The college in existence today has evolved from three earlier institutions, Franklin Male Academy, Louisburg Female Academy, and Louisburg Female College. Franklin Male Academy was founded on December 4, 1786,  when Senator Henry Hill of Franklin County introduced "An Act to Erect and Establish an Academy in the County of Franklin." The bill was enacted into law on January 6, 1787, thereby providing Franklin Academy with its first charter. Franklin Male Academy opened on January 1, 1805, and, under the able direction of Yale graduate, Matthew Dickinson, prospered in its early years and soon had an enrollment of 90 students. In 1814, a counterpart to the Franklin Male Academy was established when the State legislature ratified an act</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of the 20th century, the institution became known as Louisburg College, and the college was officially linked to the Methodist Church. Washington Duke, a Durham philanthropist, had acquired ownership of the college property in the 1890s; after his death in the early 1900s, his son Benjamin N. Duke presented the property to the North Carolina Conference of the Methodist Church. Louisburg College became coeducational in 1931, and student enrollment immediately increased. In 1952,  Louisburg College was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Building on its rich history, Louisburg College today enrolls around 750 students, 90 percent of whom go on to 4-year colleges and universities after graduation. This impressive accomplishment is achieved through a dedicated faculty who devote themselves to teaching, advising, and individual assistance to ensure that each student is academically prepared to meet the requirements of major 4-year colleges and universities. The college also holds the distinction as North Carolina's only residential  junior college providing a unique educational experience and filling a niche for those college freshmen and sophomores who desire to further their education in a collegiate atmosphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisburg College has made a significant impact on the intellectual life and development of countless North Carolinians over the past four centuries, an accomplishment that indeed deserves commendation by the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
