    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator KENT CONRAD is an original cosponsor to <bill type="s" number="331">S. 331</bill>, a bill to provide grants from moneys collected from violations of the corporate average fuel economy program to be used to expand infrastructure necessary to increase the availability of alternative fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my floor statement on January 18, 2007, I referenced Senator CONRAD as a cosponsor but he was omitted from the list of cosponsors of this legislation. I ask that the RECORD be updated to reflect Senator CONRAD's original cosponsorship.</paragraph>
