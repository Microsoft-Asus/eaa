  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of North Carolina State trooper David Shawn Blanton, Jr., who was tragically killed on June 17 during a routine traffic stop near Canton, NC. David is the 59th North Carolina State trooper to have been killed in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David was only 24 years old and was a 2-year veteran of the North Carolina Highway Patrol. He was a native of Sylva, NC, and a 2002 graduate of Smoky Mountain High School, where he was a football and wrestling star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all grateful for David's dedication to protecting the citizens of North Carolina. He lived in Cherokee with his wife Michaela, who had just given birth to their son Tye 2 weeks prior to his untimely passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David was a member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Tribe and the first member of that tribe to serve with the highway patrol. In addition to being a State trooper, David volunteered as the junior varsity softball coach at Smoky Mountain High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with his wife Michaela and son Tye, David is survived by his father David S. Blanton Sr., stepmother Jennifer Blanton, mother Jeanell Youngbird, younger brothers, Jerry R. Blankenship, Jim Kye Blankenship, Jesse J. Blanton, and sister Natalie E. Blanton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David's friends, family, fellow troopers, and the people of North Carolina are mourning this very tragic loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that there are no words that I can offer to help comfort Michaela and other members of the Blanton family, but I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in keeping them in our thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David gave his life in service to our State, and this ultimate sacrifice should never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I send my deepest condolences to all who had the privilege of knowing this young man who gave his life in service to our State.</paragraph>
