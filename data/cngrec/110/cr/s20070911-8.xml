  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Senate receives the message from the House on <bill type="h" number="1538">H.R. 1538</bill>, the Wounded Warrior legislation, with a request for a conference with the Senate, the Senate agree to the request and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am in support of this. I know we all are in favor of the Wounded Warrior legislation, as well as the troop COLA amendment, which I am proud to say passed by unanimous consent of the Senate. But it is not technically in order for the Senate to act at this time, as the bill is over on the House side. Therefore, I would object.</paragraph>

  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend, if he heard my request--maybe he was diverted momentarily--I said that "if" the Senate receives a message from the House on <bill type="h" number="1538">H.R. 1538</bill>, the Wounded Warrior bill, with the request for conference, then the Senate agree to the request.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification. However, the objection still stands, inasmuch as it is premature to pose that unanimous consent request at this time.</paragraph>

  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
