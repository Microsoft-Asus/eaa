    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, talking to folks in the district last night in a telephone town hall conference and visiting with folks in my district, they want to know what Congress is doing about gas prices and energy prices. People are struggling as they try to fill up their gas tank. They're struggling when they go to the store and see inflated food costs. And so far, we haven't seen any results from Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, are in charge, they've been in charge. They said they were going to take over and they would have a plan. The Speaker, the then leader on the other side, said they would have a plan. Where is the plan? Gasoline prices when the Democrats took control were just a little over $2. Now they're reaching $4 in some areas. Where is the plan?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only plan I've seen is the $870,000 plan to replace the light in the dome of the Capitol, a 200-year payout. Where is the plan? People in America want to know where the plan is and how we're going to reduce gas prices for them and food prices for them.</paragraph>
