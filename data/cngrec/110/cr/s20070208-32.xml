  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I turn to the subject of submitting a resolution which I spoke about yesterday, and I do formally submit the resolution at this time. This resolution will eliminate the practice of filling the tree, which means there is a procedure to eliminate the opportunity of a Senator to offer an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a particularly problemsome week for the Senate. We are on Thursday, and twice this week action has  been taken in the Senate, on two separate matters, to foreclose Senators from offering amendments. I spoke on Monday and again yesterday on the subject of U.S. policy in Iraq, and we have a bill which has been offered by Senator Levin, and the majority leader was expected to fill the tree, if given an opportunity to do so. No denial has  been made of that practice, which was anticipated by the majority leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to proceed is a debatable motion under Senate rules. When you have a matter as important as the Iraq war, there ought to be very careful consideration given by the Senate--reputed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. Immediately upon taking up the bill, the majority leader filed a cloture motion. It was kind of odd, even for people not versed in Senate procedure, to bring up a bill which is debatable and immediately to file a motion to cut off debate, but that was what was done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Republican side, there was an interest in having alternative resolutions, ideas considered--by Senator McCain, to support the surge with benchmarks; by Senator Warner, to express opposition to a surge of 21,500; and by Senator Gregg, to have a resolution which would deal with the prohibition against funding for the troops--which obviously nobody wants to do. The troops are in harm's way. We are not going to cut off funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But behind the scenes what was happening was negotiations between Senator Reid and Senator McConnell--the agreement could not be reached giving the Republicans a fair opportunity to offer alternative resolutions, so almost all Republicans joined together to reject the cloture motion and keep the debate going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not understood in America what is happening because it is arcane, it is esoteric, it is unintelligible--they can't figure it out. But the popular view, the public perception was the Republicans were trying to protect the President, to cut off debate on the Iraq policy and not to have a vote. That, simply stated, was not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been on the record for some time, expressing my skepticism about the surge position. There is no doubt that Senator Warner opposes the President's position because he is the author of the resolution to express disapproval on the surge position. He voted against cloture. No doubt, Senator Hagel was against the President's proposal. He has been the most severe critic of the President's proposal. Senator Hagel also voted against cloture, as did almost all Republicans.  But the perception was the Republicans were trying to block debate in the consideration of the resolution of disapproval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After I announced my intention to introduce this rule change, I went to the third floor, to the press gallery, to sit down with the reporters to explain and to answer questions, to try to get a public discussion on what was happening. One of the reporters from the wire services commented that no story was written about it because it couldn't be explained to anybody beyond the beltway. It could not be explained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two of the newspapers on Capitol Hill carried brief stories about it, but the matter has been dropped. Republicans have lost the public relations battle. The issue will be taken up in the House. Maybe it will be reconsidered in the Senate. But this procedure of allowing the majority leader to stop alternative considerations is inappropriate and unfair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some pretty good authorities for the proposition that this procedure is inappropriate. I wish to cite three very distinguished Senators: Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader; Senator Richard Durbin, the assistant majority leader; and Senator Chris Dodd, Democrat from Connecticut. As I said yesterday, this business about filling the tree has been practiced by both parties. The Congressional Research Service did a study that showed that going back to Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when we Republicans controlled the Senate and we had the PATRIOT Act, Senator Reid had this to say on February 28 of last year. He was speaking in defense of a fellow Democrat's ability to offer amendments to the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. This is what Senator Reid said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, even a good bill can be improved. That is why we have an amendment process in the Senate ..... I am disappointed that he has been denied that opportunity by a procedural maneuver known as "filling the amendment tree."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic nature of the Senate. The hallmark of the Senate is free speech and open debate. Rule XXII establishes a process for cutting off debate and amendments, but Rule XXII should rarely be invoked before any amendments have been offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what Senator Reid said less than a year ago. I couldn't say it better. In fact, I couldn't say it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, a few days later on March 2, Senator Reid said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don't fill the tree. This is a bad way, in my opinion, to run the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then Senator Durbin spoke on May 11 of 2006 on the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act. Speaking about that conference report, this is what Senator Durbin had to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican majority brings a bill to the Senate, fills the tree so no amendments can be offered, and then files cloture, which stops debate. So we cannot have this conversation. We cannot offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that is exactly the plan for the Iraq issue, and that is what is being done now on the continuing resolution which has been filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Dole had this to say, speaking about health care legislation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out to our colleagues why I am terribly disappointed with the procedures we have been confronted with this evening dealing with this legislation ..... This is the Senate. This Chamber historically is the place where debate occurs. To have a process here this evening ..... to basically lock out any amendments that might be offered to this proposal runs contrary to the very essence of this body ..... If you believe the Senate ought to be heard on a variety of issues relating to  the subject matter--when the amendment tree has been entirely filled, then obviously we are dealing with a process that ought not to be ..... the Senate ought to be a place where we can offer amendments, have healthy debate over a reasonable time, and then come to closure on the subject matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, ARLEN SPECTER doesn't have to say anything more on the subject because Senator Reid, Senator Durbin, and Senator Dodd are much more eloquent than I. So I offer this resolution to correct this problem for the future. It is very hard to change a Senate rule, but nobody has proposed it in the past, to my knowledge, and today we will start on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the procedure used by the majority leader, the leader of the Democrats, to shut off debate and consideration of alternative proposals on the Iraq policy, the majority leader has utilized the procedure again on the continuing resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the continuing resolution characteristically is a brief document, usually about a page, which says the Government will continue to operate under existing appropriations, since there has not been time to consider a new appropriations package. But what we have in <bill type="hj" number="20">H.J. Res. 20</bill> is an omnibus bill running 137 pages. I want to have an opportunity to amend it. Other Senators want to have an opportunity to amend it. Some have spoken on the floor of the Senate here today. But we are foreclosed from  doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the announcement was made that we were going to go to this kind of a procedure, in my capacity as chairman last year, now ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I wrote a letter to Senator Reid asking that we follow regular order and consider the appropriation bills sequentially. I sent identical letters to Speaker Pelosi, the Republican leader, BOEHNER, in the House, Senator McConnell, Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After having been in the Senate for 26 years and being on the Appropriations Committee for 26 years, I have turned into a rubberstamp. That is what the Senators are here, those who did not have a say in the preparation of this continuing resolution. We are all rubberstamps: Take it or leave it. Now we would employ the procedure used on the Iraqi issue to avoid cutting off debate, but the Treasury will run out of money at midnight on February 15--that is Thursday night--so we have the option of  closing down the Government if we don't approve this rubberstamp procedure, and we are not going to do that. We had experience with the closing down of the Government back in December of 1995, and it was a very bitter experience; great political peril in closing down the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we have a very important measure. For a few minutes I want to point out what has happened to the subcommittee which funds health care, which is our No. 1 capital asset; you can't do anything if you don't have good health, and I can testify to that personally from my own experience in the last 2 years. Secondly, education. If you are not trained, you can't do anything, even with good health. The Department of Labor on job training and worker safety. The level of the budget for fiscal year  2005 was $143.4 billion. The President has proposed a budget for fiscal year 2008 of $141.5 billion. If you take a look at the cuts in the budget for Health, Education and Labor and you add in the inflationary factors, the committee is being asked to operate at a level of $14.7 billion less than the fiscal year 2005 budget. That simply</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the kinds of matters we ought to address on this continuing resolution. That is what we ought to be talking about, instead of having our last vote before noon on a Thursday as part of our 5-day workweek. We have yet to see that; we have yet to take the time we need to consider these matters. Had we taken up these appropriations bills in regular order, as I asked the leadership back on January 10, we would have had adequate time to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that one day, and hopefully sooner rather than later, the Senate will change its rules so the majority leader will not be able to create a procedural morass to stop Senators from introducing amendments. It is my hope Senator Reid's admonitions when the shoe was on the other foot back last year, that filling the tree is a bad practice, it runs against the basic nature of the Senate, the hallmark of the Senate is free speech and open debate, and similar comments by Senator</paragraph>
