  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, enshrined in the first amendment of the Constitution are these words: "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, in the last two decades, we have seen a troubling increase in the number of occasions where reporters have faced threats of subpoena, subpoenas and even jail time for refusing to reveal confidential sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, compelling reporters to testify and compelling them to reveal the identity of their confidential sources is a detriment to the public interest. And last week, my colleague, Congressman Rick Boucher of Virginia, along with a distinguished bipartisan group of original cosponsors, introduced the Free Flow of Information Act, which would protect a reporter's right to keep confidential sources confidential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a conservative who believes in limited government, I believe the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to give due consideration to this bipartisan legislation. Let us put a stitch in this tear in the first amendment freedom of the press. I urge cosponsorship of the Free Flow of Information Act.</paragraph>
