  <narrative>HONORING MARTIN PAONE -- (Senate - January 31, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="510">S510</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is January 31. It is signifying the end to many things: the end of the month, maybe we will begin to see a little bit of spring down the road, but it is also the end of an amazing career of someone we all know and love, and that is Marty Paone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marty Paone has worked for 32 years on the Hill, 28 years on the Senate floor. He started in the House Post Office before working in Senate parking. He joined the cloakroom in 1979 and was appointed Democratic Secretary in 1995 by Senator Daschle. He worked under four Democratic leaders: Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, Senator Daschle, and Senator Reid. I think every one of them would agree with the word that I would use to describe Marty Paone--"indispensable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not know what we are going to do without Marty here. He has been such an amazing presence, so knowledgeable; not only about the rules of the floor but just about how this body works. I know Senator Reid relied on him for just about every kind of advice. Again, his advice was indispensable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly appreciative of his kindness to me when I was a new Senator, teaching me the way the place worked, helping me realize when there would be votes so I could time my schedule. As most of you know, I like to be busy, but I hate to miss votes, as everybody else. And he was just the most knowledgeable, decent, kind, indispensable person around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now Marty is leaving. We really are going to miss him. We are going to miss his dedication to this institution. I think if you made a list of the people most dedicated to the Senate, Marty Paone would be in the top 10 or 20 in all our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to miss his ever-present--he hovered in the background quietly--omniscience, always knowing what was going on, and always being there to help. We are going to miss Marty just as a person who, in his quiet, droll way, is actually a very funny guy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to wish Marty the best. I think I speak on behalf of 100 Senators and everyone who served previously. I thank his wife Ruby for putting up with the long hours. I know because I would call Marty at home on weekends much of the time asking him for advice or when there might be a vote or this or that. His three kids, Alex, Stephanie, and Tommy--Stephanie is at William &amp; Mary, Alex goes to VCU, and Tommy is still in high school. And a particular hello, because I have heard she is watching,  to Marty's mother Evelyn Paone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Paone, God gave you 95 years, and let's hope he gives you many more. I know you are so proud of Marty, maybe even a little prouder than we all are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marty, we will miss you, we thank you, we love you. Good luck, Godspeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
