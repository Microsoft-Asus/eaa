    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a very special Idahoan who has undertaken a very important and challenging mission. Many people are moved by a cause; few are inspired to take action and leadership in support of such cause. David Joseph Lynch is one of the few. In 2004, Mr. Lynch was moved by the plight of Israeli schoolchildren--Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Bedouin, Baha'i and Christian--who do not have ready access to English language books because of limited financial resources  and demands on the Israeli government in its ongoing war against terrorism. He read an article about the Jade Bar-Shalom Books for Israel Project and knew immediately that this was his calling. This grandfather of three and great grandfather of four who will be 89 next  month, founded the Idaho flagship of the international Books for Israel project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 2004 and 2006, Mr. Lynch gathered over 10,000 books from Idaho schools to send to Israel for the schoolchildren there. His goal is to have books donated from all the counties in Idaho. Mr. Lynch has enlisted supporters from the community including school officials, bookstore owners, a restaurant franchise, Office Depot, Boise State University, and even members of the criminal justice community in Boise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Lynch on his outstanding efforts and thank him also for his esteemed service in the U.S. Navy before and during World War II. Clearly, David Joseph Lynch embodies a life of service and a commitment to improving humanity. He is an inspiration to all--a man whose singular efforts are felt across the globe by our friends in Israel.</paragraph>
