    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to suspend the rules and to pass the Broadband Census of America Act of 2007 because, Mr. Speaker, the overarching telecommunications policy goal of the United States is achieving ubiquitously available, competitive, high-speed, affordable broadband service to all Americans. Such broadband service capability is indispensable to various aspects of the United States economy, including public safety, education, entrepreneurial investment, innovation, job creation, health care delivery, and  energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ability of the United States to promote and achieve a competitive high-speed broadband infrastructure will also be a key factor in determining our Nation's success in the fiercely competitive global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International competitors to the United States are achieving progress in broadband deployment and adoption. Many countries have broadband service capabilities superior to the United States in terms of choice, speed, and price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the United States, offering broadband service capability at ever higher transmission speeds could spur new growth in investment in cutting-edge applications, services, and technologies that utilize higher bandwidth functionality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill represents an indispensable first step in developing an overarching blueprint for broadband policy in the United States. In brief, the Broadband Census of America Act tasked the Federal Communications Commission with collecting data from providers of broadband service capability throughout the country, and with developing a series of tiers for categorizing the speeds of such services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The data collected will be disclosed to the public in an annual report that will include: one, the actual number of residential and business subscribers within each five-digit ZIP code with a list of the broadband technologies present in each ZIP code: and, two, the actual number of residential and business subscribers, correlated to each broadband speed tier identified by the FCC on a statewide basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also encompasses a broadband mapping effort as well as community organization initiatives for unserved and underserved areas to increase knowledge of where, what type, and what speed of broadband service may be available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires the National Telecommunications Information Agency to develop a national broadband availability map which will include the availability of broadband service capability at the nine-digit ZIP code level, census track level, or functional equivalent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very consumer-friendly mapping function and "demand side" identification initiative that consumer groups, the high-tech community and the telecommunications industry all support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This map will be interactive and searchable by consumers, and at the providers' discretion will also indicate the type of technology and speed of service offered in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also includes authorizations for grants to local planning entities and communities around the country. These grants are designed to increase broadband availability and usage in local communities through so-called "demand side" identification and other initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To better gauge how the country is performing compared to international competitors, the bill also requires the FCC to conduct a comparison of the extent of broadband service capability  abroad in 75 foreign communities with equivalent American communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reflects several months of negotiations. And I want to thank Mr. Upton from Michigan for his patient attention to this legislation. No legislation in telecommunications has received the detailed attention that this legislation has on a bipartisan basis, and for that I want to thank Mr. Upton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton, for his work on this legislation. And of course on our side, Mr. Dingell and I worked with the minority towards achieving this legislation. And with the thanks of Mr. Dingell and myself, we once again want to point out how cooperative all of our working relationships were on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also has the support of consumer groups, the Communications Workers of America, NARUC Connect Kentucky, Qwest, and organizations representing the high-tech industry, the cable industry, the telephone industry, and the wireless industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank Mr. Upton and Mr. Barton for their cooperation in working through the differences on this legislation, and to thank Mr. Dingell for his excellent work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members of the House to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Someone watching this debate and they hear the nice words between the two of us, they are, for sure, very genuine. We had many hand-holding scenes and meetings over the last number of months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill>, and I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for allowing our thoughtful and constructive input into this process because clearly I think we ended up with a good piece of legislation. And I commend the gentleman's patience on our side as we were able to work out a consensus that, in fact, has brought us to the floor this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Mr. Barton for working with all of us to ensure that the bill was able to move forward in a bipartisan way. And Mr. Whitfield, who I remember at our first hearing on this as he talked about Connect Kentucky and the positive impact that it had there. He obviously added some good things as well to legislation. And I would urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation as it moves through this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I view the thrust of this legislation as an effort to get a better idea of the U.S. broadband penetration, not as a window to increased regulation of the already competitive broadband marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were quite fortunate to learn from the successful statewide broadband mapping plan in Kentucky called Connect Kentucky. And it isn't often that we have the advantage of looking at a successful model such as this one, which could implement in a bipartisan way again there on a national level what we're able to do on this legislation in <bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Connect Kentucky demonstrated perfectly how a public/private partnership can work with industry in a nonregulatory manner that benefits not only consumers, but also provides a catalyst to greater broadband investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, for your work on this legislation important for America and especially important for rural America. We who live in rural America understand that there are special challenges we face, whether it be in health care delivery or education, economic infrastructure. This bill will help bridge the gap that exists between rural America and urban and suburban America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing a comprehensive mapping plan, we will enable access to these issues that are so vital. Many of us think about broadband in terms of economic development and the importance that it brings to economic infrastructure. Certainly, that is a big part of what access to high-speed Internet is all about. But it is more than that. It affects quality of life in many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard about distance learning and the affect that it has on the educational process. We have heard about telemedicine and the ability to deliver quality health care. Certainly it affects the ability of our first responders to coordinate efforts in the event of disasters or emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill for rural America. I commend our leadership, as well as the ranking member for his leadership in helping to enact its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I, as well, have no additional requests for speaking time. I would like to thank the staff who worked on this bill, Tim Powderly, Amy Levine, David Vogel, Neil Fried, Courtney Reinhard, thank you, Michael Beckerman, and I would like to thank Maureen Flood from my staff for her excellent work on this legislation. And to correct an oversight from the last piece of legislation, I would like to thank Colin Crowell, who has worked on both this bill and the last bill which  just passed as well. I can't say enough about Colin and his work on all of these issues to bring them to a conclusion that is truly bipartisan and nonideological.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, as amended, and <bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="">
    <paragraph>So with that, I again, highly recommend this piece of legislation to the Members. It is something that will give us the broadband overview that our country needs. We have been falling over the last 6 years in our international rankings. It is time for us to find out exactly where we are because it will help us to put together the policies that will make us No. 1 looking over our shoulders at No. 2 and 3 in the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill>, the "Broadband Census of America Act of 2007".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation marks an important step in bringing us closer to affordable, robust broadband service for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently the Government does not adequately collect information on the extent of broadband deployment and usage in the United States. <bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill> addresses this knowledge gap by improving the quality and quantity of data that the Government is authorized to collect concerning broadband availability and subscribership. Armed with this information, Government decision-makers. will have the in-depth information necessary to craft informed, coherent broadband policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill> calls for the creation of a national broadband inventory map. This map will depict, at granular levels, where broadband service is available. We are informed by the efforts of States such a Kentucky that have successfully developed similar maps. State-level experience tells us that this map will likely spur the deployment of additional broadband facilities and will be a valuable resource for consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3919">H.R. 3919</bill> will also jump start efforts by local communities to improve broadband deployment and usage through the creation of grant programs to facilitate the collection of data for the broadband inventory map and local technology planning. These programs will help bring broadband facilities to communities that currently have little or no service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill produced through positive, bipartisan efforts. I commend Ranking Member BARTON, Subcommittee Chairman MARKEY, and Subcommittee Ranking Member UPTON for their leadership and contributions to this legislation. I am proud to support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>
