  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO HAROLD "SHORTY" DORN -- (Senate - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4616">S4616</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, Albert Einstein once said, "It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge." I wish today to pay tribute to the life and legacy of an Oregonian who devoted his career to that supreme art and, in doing so, made a priceless contribution to the field of journalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harold "Shorty" Dorn passed away in Reston, VA, last week at 83 years of age. Like countless others of his "greatest generation," Shorty proudly wore the uniform of our country during World War II. He entered the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943 and served in the Pacific until the end of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon returning home, Shorty earned his college degree and began nearly four decades of service as a college professor. Generations of Oregonians are fortunate because the vast majority of Shorty's career was spent at two of my State's outstanding institutions of higher learning--10 years at Eastern Oregon University in LaGrande and 23 years in the Department of Journalism at Oregon State University in Corvallis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professor Dorn was admired and respected by his students for his intelligence, his integrity, his warm humor, his trademark quips, and for the fact that he genuinely cared about them and their future. Shorty's commitment to his students did not end upon their graduation, and many continued to call on him for advice and counsel as they moved on in their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as Shorty was devoted to his students, he was also devoted to his family--to his wife Ethel and to his two daughters, Jenna and Lorah. Upon retirement from Oregon State University, Shorty and Ethel moved to Reston, VA, so he could be closer to his daughters, who were both building distinguished careers of service. He also discovered that one of the best parts of retirement was the time he had to be a wonderful grandfather to his two grandsons, Jon and Ben.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it was once said that, "In a completely rational society, the best of us would be teachers and the rest of us would have to settle for something less." Shorty Dorn was certainly one of the best of us, and I extend my condolences to his family and friends.</paragraph>
