    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Energy Independence and Security Act before us later today. This landmark energy bill moves our Nation forward towards a new, brighter energy future. It promotes clean homegrown energy by requiring our utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from renewable energy by 2020. It reduces our dependence on foreign oil by raising fuel efficiency standards on our cars by 40 percent. With the price of oil nearing $100 per barrel, this will  save consumers billions of dollars. And it saves energy through energy-efficiency standards and incentives like the effort I led to promote the construction of energy-efficient commercial buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These policies will create new jobs and build new American industries, while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. And it is all paid for by reclaiming $21 billion in taxpayer subsidies from the oil and gas industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support of this fiscally responsible, smart new energy policy that embraces American ingenuity, innovation, and leadership and moves America forward towards a cleaner, more secure future.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
