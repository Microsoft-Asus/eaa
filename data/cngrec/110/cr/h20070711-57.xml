    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Consulate General of the United States in Bermuda on their events to celebrate the 231st anniversary of American independence, of which G.K. Butterfield and myself acted as cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Society of Bermuda and the United States Consulate skillfully joined together in such an exemplary manner that it deserves to be noted here in Congress. These events are powerful examples of how we can partner with our host countries around the world to the benefit of America's sound principles and democratic values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when we need the strongest promotion of what is truly the American way, the staff of the United States Consulate General in Bermuda provided the activities and the outreach that immediately impacted on all those present and portrayed the richness of our American philanthropy and caring.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
