  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9622">S9622</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the morning we will likely come in at 9:30, and we will have a half hour of debate prior to the vote at around 10 o'clock, and that will be in the wrap-up closing papers this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say to all Members, there are negotiations going on regarding the financial bailout. We are hopeful and confident something can be reached in this regard, but we will see. Now all parties are negotiating. We have had some concern today if that, in fact, was going to take place, and it has, and it is now going forward. So we would hope that if agreement can be reached, we will do it this weekend sometime. Therefore, we are going to have to be in session on Monday. If we have a vote  on Monday, it will be very early, as early as possible. That is to complete whatever work the negotiators had done over the weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand that at sunset on Monday night there is a Jewish holiday. We will honor that every way we possibly can. We would not consider being in session on Monday but for the fact that we have been told by Secretary Paulson and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve that there is a financial crisis out there, and that is what is being done in S-116 downstairs in the Foreign Relations Committee room today and will go on throughout the night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to complete, before we leave here, the Defense Department authorization bill. It is important we do that. We have that from the House. We are going to complete that. Rail safety, Amtrak--we will complete that before we leave. I have had a number of conversations with the White House. We are going to complete the India nuclear agreement before we leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with all these things we are getting cooperation of Senators. If we do not get cooperation, we can get them done anyway, it just takes a lot longer--a lot longer. So I would hope the people who have objections to these pieces of legislation will be considerate, as I am sure they will be, to the schedules of other Senators. We have an election on November 4. We have tried mightily to finish our work on this Friday, today. But circumstances have weighed against us doing that with the financial  problems we have had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The largest bank failure in the history of our country was yesterday. The bank that failed had more than 2,000 separate branches. So we are going to have to continue our work here. We just cannot leave with all the work we have to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vote in the morning is an important vote. I hope we will have good attendance at that vote. We will talk more in the morning to see if something has happened during the night that will change the statement I made today. That will be the only vote tomorrow, the one we will have at or around 10 o'clock in the morning. We hope we don't have to have a vote on Sunday. This is a cloture vote. There are 30 hours that runs, and we would hope that everyone would understand, if cloture is invoked,  there is not much to be gained by waiting and making everybody come back and vote. But we will see what happens.</paragraph>
