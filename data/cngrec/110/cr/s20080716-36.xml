    <paragraph>Madam President, today I rise to recognize Sully County and the town of Onida, SD. They will commemorate the 125th anniversary of their founding with celebrations August 7-10, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sully County and Onida were founded in 1883. Onida was named after Oneida, NY, with the intentional misspelling. Sully County was named after the builder of Fort Sully, General Alfred Sully. Since their beginning 125 years ago, the communities of Onida and Agar have continued to serve as strong examples of South Dakota values and traditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Sully County on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
