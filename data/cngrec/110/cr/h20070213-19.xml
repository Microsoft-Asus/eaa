    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the security at O'Hare Airport is not what it should be. Reports over the weekend showed 3,700 security badges have not been returned from former employees no longer allowed to work at the airfield. Many of the badges had not been canceled and would permit anyone access to an aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to CBS TV, several of the employees involved had previous arrest records and convictions for nonmajor crimes. Reports also indicated that several doors at O'Hare did not even have ID scanners, allowing anyone who appeared to be official to enter the airfield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Agency and Federal law enforcement officers that I have met with have all promised action. While they can levy fines on the contractors involved, the penalties should be increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later this month, I will introduce legislation levying a fine of $10,000 per day for an airport security badge that is not canceled for an employee that was fired. That should get their attention and help make the world's busiest airport more secure.</paragraph>
