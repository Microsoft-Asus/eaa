  <narrative>MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3311]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Upton moves that the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> (an Act to provide for the continuation of agricultural programs through fiscal year 2012) be instructed to recede to the provisions proposed to be added to Section 9001 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 in the form of a definition of "Renewable Biomass."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. UPTON (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the motion be considered as read.</narrative>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden) will be recognized for 30 minutes each.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will say I know that the hour is late. Many of us are trying to get home for the weekend, and there is business after me. So I don't at all intend to take too much of my 30 minutes that I have. But let me yield myself as much time as I may consume now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are woefully unprepared to meet our energy needs for the next 30 years. Some estimates say that our needs in this country are going to increase as much as 50 percent by the year 2030. So we are going to have to do a much better job on not only looking at alternative forms of energy, we are also going to need to do much more on conservation, nuclear and a whole host of things. And as the majority leader indicated a short time ago, we are looking for some long-term strategies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this instruction to the conferees does is it takes, in essence, a piece of legislation, a bipartisan piece  of legislation that the Energy Subcommittee held hearings on earlier this week, a bill offered by the gentlelady, Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, which is bipartisan, and it expands the definition of renewable fuel and biomass to include wood removed as byproducts from National Forest System land or any organic matter that is available  on a renewable basis from non-Federal land, including renewable plant material which includes feed grain, other agricultural commodities, other plants and trees, waste material, including crop residue, et cetera, food and yard waste. And it would instruct the conferees to include this on the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the farm bill is a bill that is moving along. The farm legislation is a bill that is going to be on the President's desk we hope in the not too distant future. So this is a bill that is going to move.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why not take a piece of bipartisan legislation that deals with alternative fuels like ethanol, expand that, and actually get it to the President's desk so we can do it right away rather than wait for more hearings, markups and dealing with the Senate? Who knows what happens over there. We can actually get this thing done and then address part of the needs that we have in this country to expand our alternative fuel base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like to think that we could adopt this. I know that there is quite a bit of support on it based on the hearing that we held earlier this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400183" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it appears that my friend from Michigan's motion is to instruct the House to recede to the Senate's definition of renewable biomass. The House conferees have receded to the Senate on their definition of renewable biomass. That definition of renewable biomass that is included in the farm bill applies only to farm bill programs. This definition does not apply to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The farm bill conferees report does not amend <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, that despite the fact that several members of the Agriculture Committee, including myself, are supporting efforts to amend the shortcomings we see in that bill. And I say to my friend from Michigan that I am going to have to oppose this motion to instruct at this time. And I agree with your position on this. But yet you know there are multijurisdictional concerns that have to be addressed with the Energy and Commerce Committee. And we are  trying to work through all of these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The farm bill conference is all but done. Over the last few weeks, I have been saying we need to dot our I's and cross our T's. The I's are dotted and we are crossing our T's. So even though I agree that the argument that my friend is making on the problems of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> are correct and on target, we cannot do it on this farm bill. The hour is too late. So I would oppose my good friend's amendment at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400414" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close if the gentleman yields back his time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400183" topic="">
    <paragraph>Again, the argument that my friend makes is credible. But at this time, we just cannot accept it. The conference is all but over. And I would oppose my friend's motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400414" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I just might say in closing as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, we had what I thought was a very favorable hearing earlier this week. I would like to think this is a vehicle we can move this legislation on very quickly rather than resort to the normal process, particularly as we look long term. We can do this in the short term. It makes a lot of sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge a "yes" vote on the motion to instruct the conferees to include this in the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to instruct.</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the motion to instruct.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400414" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.</chair>
