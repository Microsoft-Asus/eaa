  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, soon after the Revolutionary War, Alexander Hamilton selected the area around the Great Falls of the Passaic River as a site for the first planned industrial center in America. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, invited Pierre L'Enfant to design the city in 1791. The result was the City of Paterson, New Jersey, which became one of the most important manufacturing centers in America during the Industrial Revolution. President Gerald Ford designated the Great Falls  Historic District as a national historic landmark in 1976. The 104th Congress established an historic district and authorized the restoration, preservation, and interpretive program for the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill>, sponsored by our colleague, Representative Bill Pascrell, the former mayor of Paterson, designates the historic district as a National Historic Park and a unit of the National Park System. This bill contains standard management language for NPS units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a unique area and will make an excellent addition to our National Park System. Representative Pascrell is to be commended for his tireless efforts on behalf of the legislation and the city and the people of Paterson. We urge the adoption of this bill by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while <bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill> went through both a hearing and a full committee, but not subcommittee, markup, several issues have gone unresolved. The National Park Service conducted a study as requested by this body to determine whether the Great Falls Historic District in Paterson, New Jersey, should become a national park. The study concluded that the area did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the National Park System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if we entrust the National Park Service with the management of our own crown jewels, then why are we ignoring their expert judgment that this should not be a national park? I remind my colleagues that we requested the park service to tell us what should be done here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize also it is our responsibility and our right as the legislative branch to decide what will become a national park regardless of what the park service tells us. There are times when it is necessary to disagree with them. However, in this case, we do not even know what the costs are. We don't know, nor does the park service have any idea, how it would manage the area. That is what we asked them to tell us and they are not in a position to do that at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the park service has already got a full plate and a billion dollar maintenance backlog. They are not even keeping up with and taking care of the parks that have been entrusted to them. So is this really the time to add another park that doesn't meet the criteria to add to this burden with this designation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may consume to the gentlemen from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the sponsor of the legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in strong support of the passage of the Paterson Great Falls National Park Act, <bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill>. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the Speaker, Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their tireless work in bringing this worthy legislation to the floor. I want to thank all the members of the New Jersey delegation, Democrats and Republicans. All of them endorsed this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a lifelong Paterson resident, as the city's former mayor, I fought for many years to bring recognition to this site that has played such a seminal role in American history. The National Historic Park is the only way to properly showcase the significant cultural and historic landmarks and natural beauty that the Great Falls Historic Park District has to offer. This legislation ensures that it will get the recognition and support that it richly deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 15 miles west of New York City, the Great Falls was the second largest waterfall in Colonial America. At the Great Falls, Alexander  Hamilton conceived a plan to harness the force of water to power the new industries that would secure our economic independence. He told the Congress of the United States and the American people that at the Great Falls he would begin to implement his ambitious strategy to transform an agricultural society,  dependent upon slavery, into a modern economy based on freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How dare anyone imply that this is not significant. It was the power of the Great Falls. True to Hamilton's vision, Paterson became a great manufacturing city. It produced the Colt Revolver; the first submarine, John Holland, 1878; the aircraft engine for the first transatlantic flight; more locomotives than any city in the United States; more silk than any city in the world. This is not significant, Mr. Speaker? Cotton sails for the U.S. Navy early in the 19th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, scholars have concluded that Pierre L'Enfant's innovative water power system in Paterson and many factories built later constitute the finest remaining collection of engineering and architectural structures representing each stage of America's progress from a weak agrarian society to the leader in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Falls Historic District is the only national historic district that includes both a national natural resource and a national landmark, the only one in the entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a special bicentennial speech in Paterson, with the spectacular national beauty of the falls behind it, the President of the United States, the late Gerald Ford, in 1976, and I had the honor as a Democrat to introduce him that day, Mr. Speaker, said this: "We can see the Great Falls as a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make America the most powerful Nation in the world." Now, so many years later, we are that much closer to making the dream of a national park in Paterson a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not see facts and figures here, Mr. Speaker. I see the faces of hardworking people from all over the world, who came to Paterson, came to the falls and worked in those factories. We are talking about human beings. We are talking about people who came here and made this country the greatest country in the world, who asked nothing, who didn't get a real living wage until years later. I am talking about those people who are not faceless, who do have names, who worked hard to give their children  a better opportunity, a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Alexander Hamilton's dream, to bring economic superiority to the United States, so that we would not pretend to be an agrarian society for the rest of our history. He introduced the Industrial Revolution; and then, secondly, to give equal opportunity to each person regardless of where he came from, what he looked like, how he cooked his food, how he spoke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation enjoys bipartisan and widespread support. It is cosponsored by every member of the New Jersey congressional delegation. National conservation and historic organizations, our Nation's most renowned Hamiltonian scholars and distinguished professors throughout America have documented that this historic district is worthy of National Historic Park designation. When the park service says it is not worthy because we have other places, they were even against Lowell, Massachusetts.  They didn't support Lowell, Massachusetts either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has to do with urban parks. This has to do with how we became the country we are today. Editorial boards, Federal, State, local officials and community groups have also endorsed the campaign to create a National Park Service unit. Today, on page 3, U.S. News, a full page on the Paterson Falls and two other places in the United States, where that historic district, where the park service was able to in partnership with the locality, with the State, to bring economic opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that this park will be run as a partnership between the State of New Jersey and the Federal Government, as they already have a State park designated at the site. The National Park Service has a long history of Federal and State cooperation, from the Lowell National Historic Park to the Redwood National State Parks in California. It is park service policy to foster State and Federal partnerships to fund and manage parks. Great Falls will be no different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the Great Falls District were added to the park system, Federal resources could be leveraged to revitalize the falls, the entire city, the entire area. Through this Federal partnership, the Great Falls will be transformed into an attraction for visitors and Patersonians alike that can lead to the economic revitalization of this entire area, be a living reminder of our Nation's rich industrial history with so many of our star places where we put purple ropes around them, "don't  touch." That is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about living history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must act now to pass this vital piece of legislation, so that we may fully recognize these cultural and historic landmarks that have played such a decisive role in America's history. Today, Mr. Speaker, we have that opportunity. I hope we will all come together and support that opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do need to address the question, and it may have been rhetorical, how dare anyone imply that this area is not significant? I haven't heard anybody imply such a thing. It is truly significant. That is not the issue. The issue is priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been hearing for the last week how important it is for poor children to have health care insurance. There are so many priorities; yet there are thousands and thousands of wonderfully historic significant pieces of property. No one, I would hope, would dare say that this area was not significant. It is quite significant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my friend from Georgia (Mr. Price).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion of the gentleman from New Jersey. I share his passion for national parks, and I am sure that this area is a beautiful and a wonderful area. As such, it has already been designated as a National Historic District, which makes it eligible for about $3 million in funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out, as my friend from Texas said, that it is the National Park Service that said it didn't meet the criteria, not us. I am pleased, though, to hear from my friend from New Jersey that, in fact, the partnership with the State will be ongoing. I had understood that the State of New Jersey had not agreed to provide matching funds. I wonder if the gentleman might be able to clarify that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, the State of New Jersey has designated this as a State park. It has committed $10 million to the project in true partnership. The municipality has also done the same thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I appreciate that. That is information I had not had. My concern is kind of rising to the 30,000- or 40,000-foot view for the National Park Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I represent the Sixth District of Georgia, which is on the northern side of the City of Atlanta, and through my district runs the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, a 48-mile long linear park, the longest linear park in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have been trying to get accurate communication from the National Park Service about how they determine how much of their resources, their finite resources that they have, come to the various national parks across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We asked that because, as my friend from Texas mentioned, the National Park Service appears to be at least $1 billion, if not more, in arrears on their maintenance and operations budget. So the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area has trails that are, in fact, a danger to those that visit this beautiful park. It is unable to patrol the park, again, a 48-mile linear park. It doesn't have the number of full-time equivalent employees that ought be there for this size park. When we look at  other parks around the Nation, we see that parks of equivalent visitation, the same number of folks visiting each year, get a significantly greater budget. So as we try to drill down and find  out why that is, it appears</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we asked the National Park Service, what is your formula? How do you determine how much of your budget goes to various national parks and national recreation areas. Of course, we haven't been able to get that answer. It hasn't been just a week or two, Mr. Speaker; it has been years, years, that we have been trying to get that answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise with great concern about the political nature of the relationship of the National Park Service and the priorities that they set. And as my friend from Texas raised, there may be some concerns about this bill that we have on the floor today about that matter as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I raise a greater concern, a concern that I believe would be appropriate, to pull back this resolution and find out from the National Park Service the answer to those pivotal questions that Americans want to know, and that is is there any rationale to how you are spending your money. Where is the accountability in how you spend your money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey and his passion for this area. I am sure it is a beautiful and wonderful area, and I look forward to visiting it at some point in the future. But I believe we have got challenges and problems within the National Park Service. I hope we address those first.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia, if I am not mistaken, the original designation for the Chattahoochee National Recreation Area was also not supported by National Park Service, and I know that the people of Georgia are glad that this Congress used its legislative prerogative to create that designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, let me yield such additional time as he may consume to the sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to address some of the cogent points that have been presented by the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not talking about hundreds of square miles here. We are talking about 110 acres of land. We are talking about in the middle of that property the second largest falls in the East. We are talking about what Alexander Hamilton said in 1774, before the establishment of the Society of Useful Manufacturers, before America decided that it was going to go that industrial route so that we would have a multifaceted economy, he discerned that at that falls that water power would bring tremendous  job growth and tremendous facilitation to economic growth and industrial growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was right. He was absolutely right. No other industrial city, no other city that brought the technology and science from England and from other parts of Europe had the success that Paterson had. There were seven or eight major areas, and I pointed them out and I am not going to do it again. I am going to tell you, there is no other area, and all powered by the falls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, when we talk about alternative energy sources, and both sides of the aisle have been talking about it, and talking and talking and talking and talking, it was really at the falls that we had the beginnings of hydroelectric power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I think the significance is not to be simply caught up in how beautiful the place is. We are not talking about aesthetics; we are talking about what the meaning of this place is, where all races and all creeds and all nationalities worked during what we call the Industrial Revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a national landmark and a national natural landmark, and there is no other place in the United States that meets that criteria. Isn't that interesting. So while the park system opposed Lowell and opposed a lot of things, it is the Congress that will determine in the Constitution, the Congress will determine what is a park system and what is not. That is our authority; that is our responsibility. And today I hope, with your good sense, we will have bipartisan support of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but I understand, and I have not had the privilege of visiting the Great Falls area, it is supposed to be one of the most beautiful areas and I am greatly appreciative of that. As I understand, this area is expected to include a microbrewery, a climbing wall, and an apartment complex is what was brought to my attention. And these of course raise other issues of liability. When we look around the country at all of the parks that are struggling  right now to take care of their needs because the park service is a billion dollars in arrears as far as taking care of their current obligations, it should cause us to look carefully and go slowly in absorbing other land until we have the wherewithal to do so and the park service is able to work with Congress to come up with a solid plan to care for the park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also other issues when you bring in these other things like a microbrewery, a climbing wall, and an apartment complex regarding liabilities that may arise. There are so many questions still out there yet to be resolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say with regard to the Resources Committee, I am well pleased there are so many things that are completely bipartisan, and we have a number of them today. But because of the issues involved here, we will be asking our colleagues to vote "no" until we have a better plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me just in closing say this legislation, <bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill>, this designation goes beyond a simple designation. It speaks to the strengthening of our independence as this Nation develops. It speaks to a beautiful natural resource that needs to be protected and designated, and it speaks to an historic legacy about people and industrial advancement that needs to be preserved and enhanced and designated for the whole Nation to appreciate. I want to thank the sponsor of the legislation  and urge my colleagues to exercise the wisdom of Congress and approve <bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill>, the Paterson Great Falls National Park Act of 2007. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation along with the New Jersey Congressional delegation. I also want to thank my colleague, Mr. Pascrell, a Paterson native and former mayor, for his hard work in drafting this bill and bringing it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="189">H.R. 189</bill> will establish a National Park in Paterson, NJ, encompassing 118 acres of the Great Falls National Historic District and the adjacent Hinchliffe Stadium. These sites are of great historical significance to New Jersey and to the Nation at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1791, Alexander Hamilton created the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, a public-private corporation, to fulfill his vision of transforming the United States from an agrarian society into an industrial power. The society, in turn, established Paterson 1 year later as America's first planned industrial city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located 15 miles west of New York City, the centerpiece of Hamilton's industrial city is the Great Falls, a 77-foot waterfall on the Passaic River. After implementing engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant's water power system, dozens of mills and manufacturing buildings were built on the banks of the Passaic, harnessing the hydropower made available by the Great Falls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paterson was the heart of the industrial revolution in the United States, with dozens of mills producing paper, cotton, and enough silk for Paterson to earn the nickname "Silk City." As one of the earliest centers of manufacturing in the United States, Paterson was also home to historic inventions such as Samuel Colt's first repeating revolver and inventor John Holland's early submarine prototypes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paterson's Great Falls is also the site of historic Hinchliffe Stadium, which served as the homefield for the New York Black Yankees of the Negro Leagues during America's Jim Crow era. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004, Hinchliffe Stadium is one of a handful of remaining stadiums used by Negro League baseball teams. Hinchliffe stadium hosted baseball legends such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and Larry Doby, who became the first African American to integrate the American  League. The stadium is a poignant reminder of a bygone era of our country's national pastime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the passage of this bill, Members of the House will create a unique national park that protects a striking natural resource along with cultural and historical sites that tell the stories of our Founding Fathers, America's  economic rise and of the African American experience. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>
