and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the people of Zimbabwe deserve the assistance of the international community in the restoration of fundamental human rights, democratic freedom, and the rule of law: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) calls on all security forces, informal militias, and individuals to immediately cease attacks on and abuse of civilians;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the unanimous support of the Congressional Black Caucus, all 21 other Members, who have joined as original cosponsors to this resolution condemning post-election violence in Zimbabwe and calling for a peaceful resolution to the current political crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, assertive U.S. diplomatic engagement has contributed to conflict resolution in many African countries, especially over the past decade. Zimbabwe is one of the few exceptions, unfortunately. While many African countries moved to embrace democracy and rule of law, the dictatorship in Zimbabwe has taken the once promising country to a state of anarchy and haplessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Robert Mugabe has been in power in the country since it got its independence in 1980, along with Joshua Nkomo, one of the great freedom fighters. The two joined in building Zimbabwe in its early days. Great strides were made, especially in education, and Zimbabwe became a leader in that area throughout Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The country began to progress during those early days; however, when multiparty elections were introduced, the Mugabe regime began to lose its prominence. The Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, became an alternative to ZANU-PF.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In reaction to the winds of democracy, the Mugabe regime cracked down on the opposition party and thwarted democracy. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered since that time under the brutal dictatorship of the Mugabe regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent elections in Zimbabwe in March were a clear signal by the people of Zimbabwe that they wanted real change. Yet, Mr. Mugabe once again is in the process of crushing the democratic aspiration of the people of that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of stepping aside, his regime has been engaged in a brutal crackdown against opposition elements. Dozens of people have been killed, and leaders of the opposition have been imprisoned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The international community has done very little to help bring about change in Zimbabwe. We should not allow one dictator to ruin the way of life for millions of innocent civilians. Enough is enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1990s saw the spread of democracy across the continent of Africa, once dominated by military dictators and authoritarian leaders. The ghastly civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia have finally come to an end. C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire now is moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DRC crisis, which erupted in 1998 and threatened to disintegrate the entire subcontinent, actually ended after a long and dedicated effort by African leaders that came up with a solution to that war of many countries in the DRC. In 2006, the Democratic Republic of Congo held its first democratic elections in years. Yet Zimbabwe still suffers from a brutal dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The African Union, despite limited resources and capacity to deploy peacekeepers to a number of countries, have done so in several instances without delay. The African Union deployed an African mission to Burundi back in May of 2003 after an agreement was signed in order to support a cease-fire accord and to ensure implementation of the agreement. Troops have been deployed to Sudan in the north-south dispute and even to the Darfur region. Actually, in Somalia, Ugandan peacekeepers are there under  the auspices of the A.U., even though there is a controversial intrusion of Ethiopian troops. Yet the A.U. has not been as vocal as many believe it should have been in the support of the suffering people of Zimbabwe. African leaders must speak out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prime Minister Odinga of Kenya, a long-time democracy advocate, said it right. He recently stated, "It is sad that many African heads of state have remained quiet when disaster is looming in Zimbabwe." We must act now to end the suffering. We must do what we can to protect and support the people of Zimbabwe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My resolution, <bill type="hr" number="1230">H. Res. 1230</bill>, calls for an immediate end to the violence, harassment and destruction that is ongoing in Zimbabwe at the expense of a once vibrant population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It calls on the government of Zimbabwe to create an environment conducive to a peaceful transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It encourages the political parties to commit to forming a government that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people and promotes national unity, the restoration of the rule of law, and genuine democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It advocates a mechanism such as a Truth and Reconciliation Commission through which to ensure accountability of all groups and individuals who are found to have orchestrated or committed a human rights violation in the context of the election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It urges the United Nations, A.U. and SADC to dispatch special envoys to Zimbabwe without delay, with a mandate to monitor the run-off elections and to come up with a peaceful resolution to the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It urges the international community, under the leadership of the U.N., A.U., SADC and the SADC Parliamentary Forum to deploy teams of credible persons to serve as monitors to ensure that the outcome of the presidential run-off elections reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We conclude by commending the people of Zimbabwe for their continued courage in the face of systematic prosecution and intimidation and abuse, and commit to providing continued humanitarian assistance until the economic crisis is resolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It commends the actions being taken by activists, civil society, churches, people who are in support of human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe, and we stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the resolution and support this peaceful reconciliation, national healing, and let's restore democracy to Zimbabwe and lead this country back to the greatness that it once had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1230">H. Res. 1230</bill>, which conveys a very clear and unmistakable condemnation of the violence we have seen in Zimbabwe following the elections in that country. I strongly support the resolution's call for a peaceful solution to the grave crisis there today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If anyone had a doubt about the regime of Robert Mugabe before this  most recent wave of government-inspired violence, surely this thug has dispelled it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mugabe has clamped down on the press and has thwarted the assembly of the opposition, detaining his opposition figures on numerous occasions. We have heard gut-wrenching testimony and seen gruesome pictures of the intimidation, the violence and the torture of those who disagree with this dictator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there are credible reports that some 36 people have been murdered by those loyal to Mugabe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, was courageous to return to his country, but we have all held our breath as Mugabe's forces have detained him several times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one feels safe in Zimbabwe today, Madam Speaker. Even United States diplomats attempting to monitor the regime's abuses have been harassed, their access to public places restricted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mugabe has even stooped to the pilfering of food aid and has halted international relief operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a run-off election scheduled for June 27, we need to send a message, a good, strong, bipartisan message, that we in the United States and the world expect fair, peaceful balloting. The will of the people must be heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the support of my colleagues for this resolution and pledge my support for the people of Zimbabwe in these very difficult times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished ranking member from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to just take this opportunity to recognize Chairman Payne not just for this resolution but for all of his long years of work on engagement on the continent against human rights abuses, to end apartheid, to advance the cause of democracy, and I appreciate him introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would just like to also add my view that President Mugabe has destroyed the rule of law now in his country, in Zimbabwe, and 3 million people, as a result of the chaos, have fled. Life expectancy there is down to 34 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bread basket has been turned into a basket case where there's little access for food and certainly no food available for those who are in areas where they're trying to support the Movement for Democratic Change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is becoming clear, I think, to many of us that President Mugabe will stop at nothing to prevent being voted out of office next week, and the run-off election comes after the March election in which the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, bested Robert Mugabe in that election, but because of the government's brutal machinations fell short of the 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, what really concerns us as Members of the House is that Mugabe's agents, some of them trained by the North Koreans by the way, by North Korean troops, have been let loose in an effort to terrorize that country. There's an effort to force people to vote for President Mugabe, and we have read and seen the threats and the beatings, the abductions, the burnings of homes, the murders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opposition reports indicate that of the opposition of Mugabe, 60 members of the opposition have now been killed, including four who had their eyes and tongues cut out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food is being used to reward supporters and obviously punish opponents, and Mugabe's campaign for reelection, frankly, more closely now resembles a war against his own country. You see the attacks there on the human rights groups, the churches, the unions, the rural communities that supported the opposition, and those have been targets for repeated beatings and attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Mugabe has promised war, that's his word "war," if his opponent triumphs in the election. So this is no environment right now for a fair and free election, but just as disturbing to me has been the reaction from the international community and the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The United Nations gave Robert Mugabe a stage to cynically mock his victims, participating in a food conference in Rome this month while at the same time he is withholding food at home. South African President Thabo Mbeki unfortunately has dedicated himself to shielding Mugabe from criticism. And shortly after the March election, Mbeki flew to Harare to meet with Robert Mugabe and declare "there is no crisis."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the Washington Post got it right on their editorial page where they clarify Mbeki's role in the crisis very succinctly. And the Post said he shares "the responsibility for the atrocities being committed in full view of the world because, like Mr. Mugabe, Mr. Mbeki deserves to be condemned and shunned by the democratic world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the crisis that we face, the crisis in Zimbabwe, and it is a crisis largely of Mugabe's own making. So it is time to let the will of Zimbabweans be heard and end, frankly, what has become a reign of terror and of enormous human suffering. And again, I commend Chairman Payne for bringing this resolution forward.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to again thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. Payne, for his sponsorship of this resolution. I think it sends a clear message to Zimbabwe and to Mugabe himself and to all of the enablers that have not done their fair part in trying to mitigate and hopefully end this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank Mr. Royce for his very eloquent statement made just a moment ago and for his leadership as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me express my appreciation to the ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee, Mr. Smith from New Jersey, for all the good work that he continues to do in the human rights area, and to the former Chair of the Africa subcommittee, Mr. Royce, who continues to maintain a very strong interest in the continent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to the people of Zimbabwe. The inflation rate is over 165,000 percent, worst in the world, almost impossible to calculate. Several weeks ago, Mr. Mugabe expelled the remaining international humanitarian aid groups from his country, therefore making it even worse for his people. And so we must see a change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I urge passage of <bill type="hr" number="1230">H. Res. 1230</bill> and urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1230">H. Res. 1230</bill>, Condemning Postelection Violence in Zimbabwe and Calling for a Peaceful Resolution to the Current Political Crisis; introduced by my distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Representative DONALD PAYNE, of which I am a proud cosponsor. This important legislation calls on all security forces, informal militias and individuals to immediately cease attacks on and abuse of civilians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Zimbabwean African National Union-Patriotic Front, ZANU-PF, led by President Robert Mugabe, has controlled Zimbabwe's executive and legislative branches for 28 years; over the past 8 years, ZANU-PF has suppressed political dissidents and won elections and referendums through the use of vote rigging, localized violence, harassment, and intimidation. The political and economic situation in Zimbabwe has been worsening since 2000, culminating in the current electoral crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the elections, President Mugabe has unleashed security forces and militia against opposition supporters and members of civil society. Over 900 people have been tortured and beaten, and 22 have been confirmed dead. The offices of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network have been raided and some of its employees detained. Security forces have attacked humanitarian organizations and civil society groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, such atrocities must come to an end. While the African Union, AU, and Southern African Development Community, SADC, have been continually engaged in efforts to bring about an end to the political crisis in Zimbabwe; unfortunately, after the AU and SADC dispatched delegations to Harare, they have not yet successfully compelled the Government of Zimbabwe to restore the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Zimbabwe are in desperate need of our aid. A prime example of this is represented through Zimbabwe's gross domestic product which declined about 43 percent between 2000 and 2007, and the unemployment rate of 80 percent. Zimbabwe's inflation rate, at almost 165,000 percent, is the  highest in the world and has contributed significantly to the country's economic collapse. Additionally, worsening economic conditions and commodity shortages  have caused at least 3 million people to flee the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that we must pass this legislation in order to demonstrate through our actions that the people of the United States, local, State, national organizations and governmental institutions support democracy and oppose tyranny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All parties must engage constructively towards peace and reconciliation for the sake of the Zimbabwean people. The people of Zimbabwe deserve the assistance of the international community in the restoration of fundamental human rights, democratic freedom, and the rule of law. That is why we must pass <bill type="hr" number="1230">H. Res. 1230</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support this legislation and I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in so doing.</paragraph>
