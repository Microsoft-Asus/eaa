    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3578">H.R. 3578</bill>, the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent weeks, the confidence of the American people has been shaken by the revelation that contaminated food and counterfeit products have entered our country, threatening the safety of American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, for many manufacturers in my home State of Indiana, dealing with counterfeit products has been a part of everyday business. It is estimated that these products comprise almost 10 percent of world trade, that they are costing American companies nearly $250 billion in revenue and an estimated 750,000 jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to address this IP theft, I have joined with other Members of Congress and also with Senator Evan Bayh and Senator George Voinovich on the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act. It has been endorsed by numerous groups, from the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO. This legislation creates a global task force to encourage our trading partners to join in a united effort to combat the practice of stealing intellectual property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my fellow Members to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
