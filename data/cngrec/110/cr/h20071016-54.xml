    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="222">H. Con. Res. 222</bill> which honors the 90th anniversary of NASA Langley Research Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 222 was introduced by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis. Her four terms in Congress were characterized by hard work and dedication, and I am sorry that she can't be here today to take part in these proceedings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NASA Langley is a special place. Institutions come and go in our society. You have got to be impressed with an enterprise that has delivered so reliably over the past nine decades. Located not very far from here in coastal Virginia, Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory was the Nation's first government aeronautics laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I were to list all of Langley's diverse accomplishments, we would be here until midnight. Langley research teams earned many Collier Trophies over the years, an award bestowed each year for the top contribution to American aviation. Their wind tunnel expertise brought benefits to American aviation era after era. Their first Collier Trophy was one for engine cowling research, which brought immediate large benefit to the aviation industry, resulting in greater speed of travel and enormous cost  savings. Later, Langley built the world's first full-scale tunnel. The Harrier Vertical Takeoff and Landfighter; the F-16; American's supersonic transport, SST; the space shuttle; and the lunar landing test vehicle have all been evaluated in this facility, which is still in use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The science of aviation developed rapidly, with Langley often leading the charge. No ivory tower, Langley has been so effective because of its continual interactions with the aviation community. Our military aircraft, which have turned the tide again and again, did so with capabilities developed at Langley. Their aeronautics test and analysis capabilities brought American aviation and aerospace to world preeminence and maintained that standing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great success story. Today, the aeronautics and aviation-related industries are responsible for 11 million U.S. jobs and are America's largest source of exports. Americans rely upon the aviation industry's safe and reliable transport of people and products. In our country, aviation and aerospace account for 5.4 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product. Add in aviation-related industries, and it is 9 percent. Investments in core technologies such as aeronautics pay off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Langley is also responsible for basic aeronautics research in support of the Next Generation Air and Traffic Control System, NextGen, which we are so anxious to have put into effect. Langley leads initiatives in aviation safety and in quiet aircraft technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The aerospace industry has changed rapidly, with Langley often leading the way. Langley staff work closely with Bell Aircraft Corporation and the Air Force in the design of the X-1, the first aircraft to break the sound barrier. Langley has been an important part of each U.S. space program, from Project Mercury through the space shuttle and the space station programs. It was a small group from Langley that determined the lunar orbit rendezvous strategy for sending Apollo to the Moon. Today, as  one of NASA's 10 field centers, Langley NASA is an important part of the vision for space exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Langley is helping to develop a replacement for the space shuttle, evaluating conceptual designs and wind tunnels at speeds in excess of 5,000 miles an hour. Langley has partnered with researchers around the world to study Earth from space. The clouds in the Earth's radiant energy system, or CERES, breaks ground in data accuracy. And NASA researchers at Langley are busy studying atmospheres on other planets in support of future exploration activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, with this resolution Congress congratulates and commends the men and women of NASA Langley Research Center for their accomplishments and role in inspiring American people. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 222, commending NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, on the celebration of their 90th anniversary, and out of respect to my friend and our colleague, Jo Ann Davis, who so ably represented NASA Langley and who introduced this, her last resolution, just 4 days before she passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, NASA Langley Research Center is the oldest of NASA's 10 major field centers and the Nation's first civilian aeronautical research facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research there began with 15 employees. Today, NASA Langley boasts a workforce of over 3,600. And from the very beginning, NASA Langley has been on the cutting edge of research into all aspects of aeronautics, from fixed wing to rotor craft, from propeller engines to jet engines. In fact, whether subsonic, supersonic, or hypersonic, NASA Langley Research Center has always been on the forefront of mankind's consistent refusal to keep both feet on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NASA Langley is uniquely suited to realize the current administration's bold new vision for space exploration. In 1958, as Project Mercury was commencing, NASA Langley served as the main office for the first U.S. manned space program. In the early 1960s, NASA Langley served as a training center for rendezvous and docking in space, which became known as Project Gemini. And later that decade, as Project Apollo was preparing to land the first man on the Moon, NASA Langley's facility served as the  astronaut training ground for lunar orbit and landing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Director Lesa Roe's dedicated leadership, NASA Langley will continue to play a critical role as we prepare to return to the Moon and look beyond to Mars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NASA Langley is performing an integral part of Project Constellation. They have been given the responsibility to manage the Launch Abort System for the new follow-on for the space shuttle, the Crew Exploration Vehicle, or CEV. In addition, they are greatly assisting in the design and wind tunnel testing of the CEV and Crew Launch Vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago we commemorated the 40th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik and the beginning of the space race. It is fitting that today we commemorate NASA Langley Research Center, which has and will continue to play such an integral role in our Nation's constant pursuit of the next frontier. I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Resolution 222.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I would like to rise in support of H. Con. Resolution 222, commending NASA on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Langley Research Center, located in Hampton, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation was introduced by our friend and colleague, Representative Jo Ann Davis, just a week before she succumbed to cancer; and it is with mixed emotion that I stand here today to talk about this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Davis was proud to represent the engineers and technicians at NASA Langley Research Center who have made the United States aeronautics research and testing the envy of the world for 90 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First established as the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in 1917, it was the Nation's first civil aeronautics research laboratory under the charter of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the precursor to modern-day NASA. It was created at a time when the United States was clearly lagging behind its European counterparts in the development of aircraft capable of controlled powered flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country's leaders well understood that the future economic and military well-being our country demanded development of advanced aeronautics capability, and Langley's founding was motivated in part by the evolution of aircraft used in the first World War and by our desire to match and exceed these capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The center is named after one of America's earliest aeronautical pioneers, Samuel Pierpont Langley, who began his research into aeronautical  machines in 1886. Perhaps inauspiciously, Samuel Langley's final crewed test flight ended in failure when his aircraft, launched from the top of a houseboat, immediately plummeted into the Potomac River. Just 9 days later, on December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright successfully achieved the first flight on  the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the ensuing decades, Langley Research Center's research and development activities advanced the science of aeronautics from simple propelled-driven aircraft into the jet age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their accomplishments are too numerous to mention here, but it is no exaggeration to state that Langley was the nexus from which fundamental technological breakthroughs in propulsion, aerodynamics, materials, aircraft and wing designs propelled our Nation to become the world's preeminent designer and builder of high-performance military and civil aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1958, responding to the launch of Sputnik, Congress passed legislation creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and with it the Langley Research Center's mission was expanded to lead our Nation's earliest efforts in manned space flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the initial planning, design, test, and development activities related to Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were conducted at Langley. Langley was the first of 10 research centers that now comprise NASA, and a number of highly talented engineers and scientists who began their careers at Langley eventually helped establish the other NASA centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Langley's role in space continues to this day, contributing its talents to testing the design of the new Ares One Launch Vehicle and the design testing of the Orion Launch Abort System. The Langley Research Center is home to 3,600 civil service and contractor employees, and it houses several of the world's most advanced wind tunnels and aeronautics laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Langley's record of achievements in aeronautics and aerospace research is without comparison; and it is a testament to the creativity, dedication, hard work, and technical excellence of the men and women who contributed their talents to the agency's mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as a word of caution, it bears mentioning that U.S. aeronautics research and testing programs are declining, no matter that countries in Europe and elsewhere are investing heavily in aeronautics research. The health of the U.S. aviation industry depends upon aeronautics research and development, especially long-term research that private industry cannot perform itself, in order to compete in the world market. NASA is the only Federal agency that supports research on civilian aircraft. Their  researchers are working to make our planes and our skies safer, and Mrs. Davis believed that this is a worthwhile investment of taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join with my colleagues to commemorate the Langley Research Center on its anniversary, and I urge members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I rise today to commend the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center on its 90th anniversary, and, in doing so, express my respect for the resolution's sponsor, Representative Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Davis worked tirelessly to fight for the constituents of the First District of Virginia. This resolution was the last measure that she introduced in this body before she passed on just 10 days ago on October 6. I see it as only fitting that we pass it in a timely manner to honor this research center and our late colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception as the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in 1917, the focus of research at this facility has significantly changed, yet this research center remains on the forefront of scientific advances. These advances not only benefit the larger scientific community but have also played a crucial role in our national security and daily lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of the Langley Research Center have made countless contributions to the scientific community and our aeronautic and space programs in particular. From its crucial role in advancing flight as early as the First World War to the training for operation of the lunar module of the Apollo program, which subsequently transported the first and only human life to the surface of the Moon, this facility has been responsible for numerous scientific breakthroughs for an astonishing 9 decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aeronautics played a critical role in the First and Second World Wars, providing our military with a strategic advantage that contributed to our victories in these two major global struggles. Subsequent advances in this field and the field of aeronautics provided the United States with the ability to achieve superiority in space exploration. These efforts have been crucial to our national defense and continue to play a major role in combating terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Langley Research Center is also responsible for sending the first orbiters and landers to the planet Mars through the Viking program, and is also currently engaged in development of the next generation of spacecraft essential to maintaining our leading role in space exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in commending this facility's contributions to the scientific world and the security of our country, and in doing so, honor our late colleague, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and would yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think that the NASA Langley is a real jewel for advancement of science and engineering in the United States of America, and I think it's fitting that we recognize this anniversary, their 90th, and at the same time, honor our colleague Jo Ann Davis for the hard work that she did, the great work that she did in the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Concurrent Resolution 222, because I believe NASA's Langley Research Center to be a national treasure. With this resolution we are acknowledging nine decades of outstanding technological achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, before I continue, I must note with sadness that the driving force behind this resolution, Ms. Jo Ann Davis, is no longer with us. In addition to all of the other important causes and issues for which she was such an articulate spokeswoman, she was an ardent champion of the importance of NASA's aeronautics R&amp;D programs. I shall miss her as we all will, and I am sorry that this is the last time that I will be able to have the opportunity to speak in support of one of her initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the strengths of the Langley Research Center over the past nine decades has been that while Langley researchers are experts in scientific theory, they are able to work with many others throughout the aerospace community. They aren't an isolated research lab, but instead have always worked shoulder-to-shoulder with industry and with dynamic people at other government agencies, including DOD. In short, the researchers at Langley are problem solvers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Step into the Air and Space museum and with the first glance one grasps how rapidly aeronautics has developed. The X-1, the first manned aircraft to break the sound barrier, was designed by Langley staff. Nearby are biplanes from the First World War. The separation in time is just thirty years, but what a difference!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The folks at Langley played a large role in that transformation, and in further advances in aeronautics and in space exploration, with the latter spanning their work on Mercury, Gemini, the Lunar Orbiter, Apollo, Viking, the Space Shuttle, and Space Station programs. They have been a critical enabler of our modern air transportation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, U.S. air passengers exceeded 750 million. To handle even busier skies, the Next Generation Air Traffic Control System (NextGen) is being devised. NASA Langley plays an important role in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, to test advanced concepts of aircraft self-separation, Langley conducted air-traffic-management research in its Air Traffic Operations Lab, in partnership with NASA Ames Research Center, Boeing, MITRE Corp. and United Parcel Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As another example, the NASA Aviation Safety Program--a partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and the Department of Defense that is led by Langley--recently tested a new way to predict thunderstorm turbulence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't overlook the importance of military aviation to American freedom, and the importance of Langley to military aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, during World War II, Langley used wind tunnel expertise to design modifications to fighter aircraft to improve their performance. Aerial dogfights were mostly contests between technologies, and a small improvement could make the difference between life and death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the rest of NASA, NASA Langley promotes private sector participation with the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program. The creation and transfer of innovation is a key goal at Langley. The Center delivers a steady flow of inventions and patents, across a range of technical areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In aeronautics and in space flight, Langley's parade of achievements has inspired generations of Americans, and has helped set the pace of American technological advancement. We need places like NASA Langley, and I hope that as we look back over its 90 years and celebrate its achievements, we are mindful of our future and work to maintain a strong and vital aerospace R&amp;D capability at Langley and throughout our nation.</paragraph>
