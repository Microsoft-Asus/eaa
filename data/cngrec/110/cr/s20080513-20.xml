  <narrative>FAA REAUTHORIZATION -- (Senate - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4098">S4098</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I wish to speak about Government barriers to competition in the aviation sector. Like many of my colleagues, I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to pass the legislation reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration last week. This is a difficult and dynamic time for the aviation industry, and it is important that Congress review and update our Nation's aviation policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rising ticket prices and increasing delays have made the flying experience more unpleasant for many travelers. Any inefficiencies introduced into the system only serve to exacerbate such problems. Therefore, I believe it is important that Congress reduce barriers to competition whenever possible so that the marketplace can best serve consumers and the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One issue that needs to be addressed is how Government-imposed slot controls at a handful of U.S. airports effectively bar the entry of new airline competitors at those airports. These federally regulated slot controls are intended to reduce congestion-related delays; this congestion mitigation, however, comes at the expense of open competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once slots at an airport have been doled out to the airlines, it becomes very difficult for new entrant carriers to break into the airport because the market has essentially been closed. Airlines with limited operations at these airports face similar problems should they wish to increase their presence in an effort to compete with the larger airlines. Because the marketplace has been artificially constrained, this leads to higher ticket prices and fewer flight options for travelers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been proven time and again that prices go down and flight options go up when airlines are allowed to freely compete. The Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration should take every step possible to ensure that competition can flourish at these slot-controlled airports. As these agencies administer congestion programs, I hope that they will develop mechanisms that will allow for new entrants to compete with  the more entrenched  airlines at these airports. If they are unable to do so, it may be up to us in Congress to provide them with legislative guidance to ensure a more open marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another arbitrary barrier that Congress should address is the outdated perimeter restriction at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. For over 40 years, Federal law has restricted flights at Reagan National and delayed the arrival of competition at the airport. With Senator Boxer and Senator McCain, I introduced an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill to revise Reagan National's outdated perimeter restriction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American flying public has shown strong demand for more flights between the Western United States and the Washington, DC, area. Unfortunately, the perimeter rule prevents airlines from responding to that demand by largely prohibiting flights to western cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, and Seattle. Revising the Reagan National perimeter restriction would help free-market competition, directly benefiting consumers. While I am disappointed that the FAA reauthorization  bill was pulled from the floor before my amendment could be considered, I will continue to work with my colleagues to find a way to revise the perimeter restriction so that air service between the West and Reagan National is increased in a market-based manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to the American flying public to squeeze every last bit of efficiency out of our aviation system. As the Senate considers aviation issues in the future, I hope my colleagues will work together to reduce the artificial barriers to competition created by well-intentioned yet burdensome Government regulations.</paragraph>
