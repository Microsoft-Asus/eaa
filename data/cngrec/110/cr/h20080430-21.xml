    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Deere and Company for placing 4th among more than 1,000 companies in the annual "100 Best Corporate Citizens" list, compiled by CRO magazine. I'm proud to represent John Deere facilities located in Waterloo, Dubuque, and the Quad Cities in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Deere has a long history in Iowa. Iowa farmers were using John Deere plows to break the prairie in 1837 before Iowa even became a State. In 1918, John Deere purchased the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company which transformed the company into a national leader for farm machine production. In fact, the "Waterloo Boy" tractor is displayed at the Smithsonian. In the 1940s, Deere expanded by building an industrial equipment factory in Dubuque.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Deere is the world's leading manufacturer of agricultural and forestry equipment and today employs around 47,000 people worldwide, and nearly 10,000 of them are in my district. I'm proud to have such a John Deere presence in my district, and I'm pleased that the company scored high in the areas of climate change, human rights, and philanthropy. I commend Deere and Company for all it has done in Iowa and the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Go green or go home.</paragraph>
