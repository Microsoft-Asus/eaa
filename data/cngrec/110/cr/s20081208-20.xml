  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="TED STEVENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise once again to honor a distinguished colleague and the longest serving Republican in the history of this body, Senator TED STEVENS. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said it this morning. I will say it again: In the history of this Nation, no one man has done more for one State than TED STEVENS--no one. His commitment to the people of Alaska has been as constant as the Northern Star. And the list of things he has done on their behalf in a remarkable 40-year career is as vast as the State itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we remember that legendary service, and the man who achieved it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Indianapolis 85 years ago this week, TED STEVENS made his mark early. At 19, he was flying C-46 transport planes over the Himalayas in support of the legendary Flying Tigers. His appetite for adventure took him to Oregon and Montana for college, and then to even more exotic places as a pilot in the Army Air Corps. For his bravery, TED would receive a Distinguished Flying Cross and an Air Medal. It was the first of many, many honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A decorated war veteran by his early-twenties, TED returned to California to resume his studies, and later enrolled at Harvard Law School. After law school, TED came to Washington, married a girl named Ann, and then set out on a new adventure in the vast expanse of the Alaska territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He would go on to devote the rest of his life to helping the people of Alaska achieve the same rights and privileges that those in the lower 48 took for granted. And today, the name TED STEVENS is synonymous with the State he loves. It always will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who else can say that they helped draw the borders of the State in which they live? Well, TED can. As Senator Murkowski put it: "for forty years, TED STEVENS has been Alaska." He was there at the creation. And an entire generation of Alaskans have grown up not ever knowing the Senate without him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TED will tell you he works so hard because there is so much work to do. Alaskans don't have the benefit of centuries of infrastructure and planning that much of the rest of the country does. Of the giant State's more than 200 villages, only a handful had running water when TED came to the Senate. Thanks largely to him, roughly half of them do now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one has done more for the U.S. Armed Forces than TED STEVENS. He secured funds for the F-117, to replace Air Force One, for unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator and Global Hawk, and for a replacement Coast Guard icebreaker and the F-16 program. TED was instrumental in ensuring funds for early military research on everything from breast cancer to AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TED STEVENS once said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They sent me here to stand up for the state of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 40 years, he fulfilled that charge with passion and purpose. And the Senate will never forget TED STEVENS. </paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="GORDON SMITH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to honor my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator GORDON SMITH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with GORDON since coming over to the Senate in 1998. It has been an honor and privilege to serve on both the Senate Finance Committee and Energy and Natural Resources Committee with him. GORDON has a long list of accomplishments to show for the people of Oregon and the Nation. He has served the people of Oregon well, and I know they are proud to call him one of their own. His leadership in the Senate will be missed, and it has truly been an honor serving with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank GORDON for all of his contributions to the U.S. Senate, and I wish him and his family the best of luck in their future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Senator ELIZABETH DOLE, who will be retiring from the Senate at the conclusion of the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with Senator Dole since she was elected to serve the people of North Carolina in 2002. I have also had the privilege of serving on the Senate Banking Committee with Senator Dole. She has dedicated her adult life to serve her country proudly. Senator Dole has had the distinct honor to serve in several capacities such as Deputy Assistant to the Nixon administration for Consumer Affairs, as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Secretary of Transportation  under President Reagan, and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush. Her heart and character can also be summed up by her work as the President of the American Red Cross and the impact she has had, on not only the lives of Americans, but also those abroad. A person of that caliber will be missed in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to know her and to have worked with her. I would like to thank Senator Dole for her contributions to the Senate and to the country we both love. I wish her and her family the best in all of their future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to join my fellow Senators to honor a colleague and a friend, Senator JOHN E. SUNUNU, who is departing the Senate at the close of this Congress. I have enjoyed working with Senator Sununu over the years--first in the House of Representatives and later in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in the Senate, I have had the great fortune of serving with JOHN on the Senate Finance Committee. He is a revered advocate of fiscal discipline, personal responsibility, and free markets. The two of us have stood together on numerous issues--most notably tax--and I have always believed that we could accomplish any goal because I had his voice of conviction and intellect by my side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representing New Hampshire, Senator Sununu has proven to all Granite Staters that he will fight for the simple motto that reads on their State license plate: Live Free or Die. Whether the item of the day was social security, trade, or any other topical issue, including the original intent of the Constitution, Senator Sununu has proven that he is up for any debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Senate will not be the same without Senator JOHN SUNUNU. In a time when many politicians try to increase the role of government in American life, Senator JOHN SUNUNU has always bet on the American people rather than government. I will miss JOHN SUNUNU.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="JOHN E. SUNUNU">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, four of our most valuable Senators will not return next year and we will miss them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ELIZABETH DOLE began her career in public service at about the same time I did. We were both in the Nixon White House in 1969, and since then I have enjoyed following and watching and occasionally bumping into her remarkable career. She began that career at a time when women, even if they graduated from Harvard Law School as she did, had very few options. ELIZABETH made her options--in the Cabinet, heading the American Red Cross and pioneering in a Presidential race in 1999. I have  thoroughly enjoyed working with her, as well as knowing even better Bob Dole during these last 6 years. She truly is one of America's most admired women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GORDON SMITH is the most eloquent among us Senators. Every Republican Senator would say that, and any Democrat who had heard him would agree. He has a quiet way, an intelligence and a way of speaking that commands attention and respect. He has his feet firmly planted on the ground in Pendleton, OR. He understands the private sector. He has been courageous in his willingness to support and chide and criticize his party when needed. He will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met JOHN SUNUNU when he was a college student and his father and I were Governors of our respective States. He arrives and leaves as the youngest member of the Senate. But, in our caucus, his voice is one of the voices most carefully listened to. His intelligence, his philosophical integrity and his persistence have made him a most valuable player in our Republican Conference. He has a bright career ahead of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have often thought that I should write a book called "some things you don't know about the people I work with." Someday I will. And I will start with Ted Stevens, who flew the first cargo plane into Peking, as it was then called, at the end of World War II. This was a dangerous, bold mission. It helps to explain the life of this remarkable man who helped Alaska become a State and then has defended and supported it in the Senate for 40 years. With the departures of TED STEVENS  and two other Senators of whom I have already spoken--PETE DOMENICI and JOHN WARNER--the Senate loses more than 100 years of service. More than that, this country loses three men whose view of America was rooted in the last years of World War II and the remarkable ascendancy of our country since then. Looking around the Senate, it will be difficult to find many among those of us who remain with the breadth of vision and old-fashioned patriotism that these men have contributed.</paragraph>
