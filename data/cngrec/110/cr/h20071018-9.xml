  <narrative>CHIP PROGRAM IS COST EFFECTIVE -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11732]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush rejected the wishes of the American people, 68 Senators, 43 Governors, and 265 Members of this body when he vetoed the children's health bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason that so many Democrats and Republicans support the CHIP Reauthorization Act is that it is consensus legislation that was crafted in a bipartisan fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 10 years, the children's health program has proven to be a popular and successful program, with 6 million children currently receiving quality private health care. It costs less than $3.50 per day to cover a child through the CHIP program. Insuring kids is also cost effective for taxpayers who end up picking up the tab for indigent care in emergency rooms, the most expensive way to care for a child's health. A child is also more likely to succeed in education and life if they have  access to health care at an early age, and it certainly benefits our Nation in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would hope more of my Republican colleagues would work together to recognize the success story of CHIP, and would join us today in overriding the President's veto. We need to ensure that more children have access to quality health care.</paragraph>
