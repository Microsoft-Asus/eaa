    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the people of Armenia on the May 12 Parliamentary elections. This is the first positive assessment of an election in the former Soviet Republic since it gained independence in 1991. This encouraging outcome will most certainly enhance and deepen U.S./Armenia relations, while also elevating Armenia's reputation regionally and internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few months, U.S. administration officials in Washington and Yerevan have stressed the importance of these elections and explained that substantial improvement must be made. Based on public preliminary reports, Armenia has fulfilled the test set forth by the administration and received a free and fair stamp of approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Election Observation Mission issued a statement which read, in part, and I quote, "The election is assessed in line with OSCE and Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic elections and national legislation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm especially pleased that the U.S. Embassy in Armenia joined the chorus of praise with its own assessment which reads, and again I quote, "We  share the satisfaction of international observers that the election infrastructure, both legal and technical, has been greatly improved."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join in sharing the pride of our embassy and the contributions we have helped make in advancing the course of democracy and the rule of law in Armenia. These results are the best evidence to date that our assistance to this fledgling Republic is indeed serving its intended purpose. Our shared values and the strong bonds between the United States and Armenia will no doubt continue to expand. In doing so, we will continue to foster democracy in Armenia and work towards stability  in the South Caucus region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, dozens of my colleagues joined me in sending a letter to the chairman of the House State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee calling for $75 million in assistance for Armenia in fiscal year 2008. As the appropriation process continues, I'd like to remind my colleagues of this request and renew it again today. This assistance demonstrates our commitment to Armenia, which is a friend and a supporter of U.S. policies for peace and security in that part of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Armenia's achievement also addresses concerns expressed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation with respect to these elections. Armenia has met the necessary threshold, and I'm confident that the people and the Government of Armenia will only continue to improve upon their accomplishments in achieving the standards and norms of a democratic society. And accordingly, I urge the MCC to fully fund its compact with Armenia in an expeditious manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These elections are an historic step towards a fully democratic Armenia, a goal to which the nation has demonstrated its commitment and leadership in the region through democratic reform. I congratulate the people of Armenia for this remarkable accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to enter into the Record a letter I sent with Congressman Knollenberg marking this achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 18, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR PRIME MINISTER SARGSYAN AND PRESIDENT KOCHARIAN: We write to congratulate you both on the success of the May l2th Parliamentary elections in Armenia. The success of this free and fair election cycle reflects the great progress made by Armenia in recent years to move further away from its Soviet past and towards a flourishing democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of this round of elections was well-understood and carried out honorably by your government. We appreciate Armenia's willingness to work with the U.S. government to ensure the elections were indeed free and fair. Your hard work and dedication has led to the citizens of your country following the lead of their government officials in operating in a free and democratic way to elect a new Parliament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to our continued work with you to advance the Armenian and Armenian-American agenda in the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;Joe Knollenberg, &lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;Frank Pallone, Jr., &lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Members of Congress. &lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>
  </speaking>
