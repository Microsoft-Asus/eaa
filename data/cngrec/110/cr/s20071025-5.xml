  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to have an hour of morning business. The time is controlled by the two leaders. The Republicans control the first half, the Democrats the second half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of Amtrak. Last night, an agreement was entered into regarding consideration of the pending Sununu amendment relating to rail subsidies. There will be 2 hours of debate on that amendment. Votes are expected sometime around 11:30 or 11:40 today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say that the Republican leader and I just had a conversation. We have to check with a couple of Senators on each side. What we might try to do to get out of the procedural problem we have now--because we do have one with this--is we may try to set up a couple of competing votes. We will try to do that. We know the issue is pretty well formed. We know what one side wants, and we know what the other side wants. So it is probably appropriate that we set something up so that we can vote on  both of them. What has been suggested is that we have a 60-vote margin on both of them, which, of course, is certainly done on occasion around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as soon as I finish here, I am going to go make a couple of calls to my Senators and see if we can have Senator McConnell--if he has any problems on his side, he will do the same, and maybe we can enter into some kind of an agreement and vote at 11:30, maybe two votes. We are on top of that. I think it would be a way to move into this bill so that we are actually debating the railroad Amtrak issues rather than this Internet issue, which is important, and it has to be decided within  the next few days one way or the other because otherwise it expires. So that is where we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There should be amendments throughout the day. I know I have had one Senator who asked me if there will be votes tonight, and I think it is very likely there will be votes tonight. So I think anyone considering going to Boston to watch the World Series might not be able to do that.</paragraph>
