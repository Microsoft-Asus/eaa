  <narrative>PASS U.S-KOREA TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9191]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if we want good jobs for our families, it is no longer enough to buy American; we have to sell American, sell our products and services throughout the world. The good news is that, since January, what we are selling overseas is growing faster than what America is buying from overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way to sustain that positive trend is to keep finding new customers like Peru and Panama, Colombia and South Korea. If we are serious about creating better jobs, Congress should pass the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement this year. Korea is one of the top ten economies in the world. They are our seventh largest customer, and an even bigger customer for America's agricultural community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement will give us access to nearly 50 million new customers and open the door to competing better in the entire Asian market, including against China. This agreement will lower border taxes and barriers to America's manufacturers, technology, insurance and financial services companies, our farmers and ranchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall, Congress needs to spend less time settling old political scores and more time opening up markets for good old American products in Korea.</paragraph>
