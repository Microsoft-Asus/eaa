  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - December 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15710">S15710</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="2248">S. 2248</bill>, the FISA legislation. This debate will extend until 12 noon. At noon, the Senate will vote--or thereabouts; there may be a couple minutes' slippage--on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the legislation. If cloture is invoked on the motion, the motion can then be adopted and the Senate can proceed to the bill and begin the amending process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have 10 minutes under my control. I have given 35 minutes to Senator Dodd and 15 minutes to Senator Feingold. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Missouri will allow 10 minutes from the Republican leader's time to go to Senator Rockefeller. I will give Senator Rockefeller 10 minutes. That means he will have 20 minutes. That uses all our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that be the case.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
