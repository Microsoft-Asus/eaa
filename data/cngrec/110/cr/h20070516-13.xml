  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to welcome Good Shepard Lutheran School and all the visitors that we have in our Nation's Capital today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This constitutional Republic works. The Founding Fathers, which I believe established this through divine providence, established a government based upon compromise, also a government that is concerned about the different branches of government and the checks and balance systems which then were enacted to defend against usurpation by either and each branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just come here today because many times we forget about the great institution in which we serve, about the blessings of freedom and liberties, and that God truly has blessed this Nation and will continue to do so.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
