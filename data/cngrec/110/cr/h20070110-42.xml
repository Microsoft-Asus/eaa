    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the administration is preparing to escalate the conflict. They intend to increase troop numbers to unprecedented levels, without establishing an ending date. It is important for Congress to oppose the troop surge. But that is not enough. We must respond powerfully to take steps to end the occupation, close U.S. bases in Iraq and bring our troops home. These steps are necessary preconditions to the U.S. extricating itself from Iraq through the establishment of an international  security and peacekeeping force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what the Kucinich plan which I am presenting Members of Congress today is all about. Congress as a co-equal branch of government has an urgent responsibility here. Congress under article I, section 8, has the war-making power. Congress appropriates funds for the war. Congress does not dispense with its obligation to the American people simply by opposing a troop surge in Iraq. It is simply not credible to maintain that one opposes the war and yet continues to fund it. If you oppose the  war, then don't vote to fund it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kucinich Plan for Iraq</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR COLLEAGUE: In November of 2006, after an October upsurge in violence in Iraq, the American people moved decisively to reject Republican rule, principally because of the conduct of the war. Democratic leaders well understand we regained control of the Congress because of the situation in Iraq. However, two months later, the Congress is still searching for a plan around which it can unite to hasten the end of U.S. involvement in Iraq and the return home of 140,000 U.S. troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration is preparing to escalate the conflict. They intend to increase troop numbers to unprecedented levels, without establishing an ending date. It is important for Congress to oppose the troop surge. But that is not enough. We must respond powerfully to take steps to end the occupation, close U.S. bases in Iraq and bring our  troops home. These steps are necessary preconditions to the U.S. extricating itself from Iraq through the establishment  of an international security and peacekeeping force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, as a coequal branch of government, has a responsibility here. Congress, under Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution has the war-making power. Congress appropriates funds for the war. Congress does not dispense with its obligation to the American people simply by opposing a troop surge in Iraq. It is simply not credible to maintain that one opposes the war and yet continue to fund it. If you oppose the war, do not vote to fund it. If you have money which can be used to bring  the troops home do not say you want to bring the troops home while you appropriate money in a supplemental to keep them in Iraq fighting a war that cannot be won militarily. This is why the Administration should be notified now that Congress will not approve of the appropriations request of up to $160 billion in the spring for the purposes of continuing the occupation and the war. Continuing to fund the war is not a plan. It would represent the continuation of disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to halting funding of this war, a parallel political process is needed. I am offering such a comprehensive plan today. I appreciate your consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dennis J. Kucinich,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kucinich Plan for Iraq</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. The US announces it will end the occupation, close military bases and withdraw. The insurgency has been fueled by the occupation and the prospect of a long-term presence as indicated by the building of permanent bases. A U.S. declaration of an intention to withdraw troops and close bases will help dampen the insurgency which has been inspired to resist colonization and fight invaders and those who have supported US policy. Furthermore this will provide an opening where parties within Iraq  and in the region can set the stage for negotiations towards peaceful settlement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. U.S. announces that it will use existing funds to bring the troops and necessary equipment home. Congress appropriated $70 billion in bridge funds on October 1st for the war. Money from this and other DOD accounts can be used to fund the troops in the field over the next few months, and to pay for the cost of the return of the troops, (which has been estimated at between $5 and $7 billion dollars) while a political settlement is being negotiated and preparations are made for a transition to  an international security and peacekeeping force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. Order a simultaneous return of all U.S. contractors to the United States and turn over all contracting work to the Iraqi government. The contracting process has been rife with world-class corruption, with contractors stealing from the U.S. Government and cheating the Iraqi people, taking large contracts and giving 5% or so to Iraqi subcontractors. Reconstruction activities must be reorganized and closely monitored in Iraq by the Iraqi government, with the assistance of the international community.  The massive corruption as it relates to U.S. contractors, should be investigated by congressional committees and federal grand juries. The lack of tangible benefits, the lack of accountability for billions of dollars, while millions of Iraqis do not have a means of financial support, nor substantive employment, cries out for justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is noteworthy that after the first Gulf War, Iraqis reestablished electricity within three months, despite sanctions. Four years into the U.S. occupation there is no water, nor reliable electricity in Bagdhad, despite massive funding from the U.S. and from the Madrid conference. The greatest mystery involves the activities of private security companies who function as mercenaries. Reports of false flag operations must be investigated by an international tribunal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. Convene a regional conference for the purpose of developing a security and stabilization force for Iraq. The focus should be on a process which solves the problems of Iraq. The U.S. has told the international community, "This is our policy and we want you to come and help us implement it." The international community may have an interest in helping Iraq, but has no interest in participating in the implementation of failed U.S. policy. A shift in U.S. policy away from unilateralism and toward  cooperation will provide new opportunities for exploring common concerns about the plight of Iraq. The UN is the appropriate place to convene, through the office of the Secretary General, all countries that have interests, concerns and influence, including the five permanent members of the Security Council and the European community, and all Arab nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The end of the U.S. occupation and the closing of military bases are necessary preconditions for such a conference. When the U.S. creates a shift of policy and announces it will focus on the concerns of the people of Iraq, it will provide a powerful incentive for nations to participate. It is well known that while some nations may see the instability in Iraq as an opportunity, there is also an ever-present danger that the civil war in Iraq threatens the stability of nations throughout the region.  The impending end of the occupation will provide a breakthrough for the cooperation between the U.S. and the UN and the UN and countries of the region. The regional conference must include Iran, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. Prepare an international security and peacekeeping force to move in, replacing U.S. troops who then return home. The UN has an indispensable role to play here, but cannot do it as long as the U.S. is committed to an occupation. The UN is the only international organization with the ability to mobilize and the legitimacy to authorize troops. The UN is the place to develop the process, to build the political consensus, to craft a political agreement, to prepare the ground for the peacekeeping  mission, to implement the basis of an agreement that will end the occupation and begin the transition to international peacekeepers. This process will take at least three months from the time the U.S. announces the intention to end the occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. will necessarily have to fund a peacekeeping mission, which, by definition will not require as many troops. Fifty percent of the peacekeeping troops must come from nations with large Muslim populations. The international security force, under UN direction, will remain in place until the Iraqi government is capable of handling its own security. The UN can field an international security and peacekeeping mission, but such an initiative will not take shape unless there is a peace to keep,  and that will be dependent upon a political process which reaches agreement between all the Iraqi parties. Such an agreement means fewer troops will be needed. According to UN sources, the UN peacekeeping mission in the Congo, which is four times larger in area than Iraq, required about twenty thousand troops. Finally</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. Develop and fund a process of national reconciliation. The process of reconciliation must begin with a national conference, organized with the assistance of the UN and with the participation of parties who can create, participate in and affect the process of reconciliation, defined as an airing of all grievances and the creation of pathways toward open, transparent talks producing truth and resolution of grievances. The Iraqi government has indicated a desire for the process of reconciliation  to take place around it, and that those who were opposed to the government should give up and join the government. Reconciliation must not be confused with capitulation, nor with realignments for the purposes of protecting power relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Kurds need to be assured that their own autonomy will be regarded and therefore obviate the need for the Kurds to align with religious Shia for the purposes of self-protection. The problem in Iraq is that every community is living in fear. The Shia, who are the majority, fear they will not be allowed to government even though they are a majority. The Kurds are afraid they will lose the autonomy they have gained. The Sunnis think they will continue to be made to pay for the sins of  Saddam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A reconciliation process which brings people together is the only way to overcome their fears and reconcile their differences. It is essential to create a minimum of understanding and mutual confidence between the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But how can a reconciliation process be constructed in Iraq when there is such mistrust: Ethnic cleansing is rampant. The police get their money from the U.S. and their ideas from Tehran. They function as religious militia, fighting for supremacy, while the Interior Ministry collaborates. Two or three million people have been displaced. When someone loses a family member, a loved one, a friend, the first response is likely to be that there is no reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also difficult to move toward reconciliation when one or several parties engaged in the conflict think they can win outright. The Shia, some of whom are out for revenge, think they can win because they have the defacto support of the U.S. The end of the U.S. occupation will enhance the opportunity for the Shia to come to an accommodation with the Sunnis. They have the oil, the weapons, and support from Iran. They have little interest in reconciling with those who are seen as Baathists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sunnis think they have experience, as the former army of Saddam, boasting half a million insurgents. The Sunnis have so much more experience and motivation that as soon as the Americans leave they believe they can defeat the Shia government. Any Sunni revenge impulses can be held in check by international peacekeepers. The only sure path toward reconciliation is through the political process. All factions and all insurgents not with al Qaeda must be brought together in a relentless process  which involves Saudis, Turks, Syrians and Iranians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>7. Reconstruction and Jobs. Restart the failed reconstruction program in Iraq. Rebuild roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and other public facilities, houses, and factories with jobs and job training going to local Iraqis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>8. Reparations. The U.S. and Great Britain have a high moral obligation to enable a peace process by beginning a program of significant reparations to the people of Iraq for the loss of lives, physical and emotional injuries, and damage to property. There should be special programs to rescue the tens of thousands of Iraqi orphans from lives of destitution. This is essential to enable reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>9. Political Sovereignty. Put an end to suspicions that the U.S. invasion and occupation was influenced by a desire to gain control of Iraq's oil assets by (A) setting aside initiatives to privatize Iraqi oil interests or other national assets, and (B) by abandoning efforts to change Iraqi national law to facilitate privatization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any attempt to sell Iraqi oil assets during the U.S. occupation will be a significant stumbling block to peaceful resolution. The current Iraqi constitution gives oil proceeds to the regions and the central government gets nothing. There must be fairness in the distribution of oil resources in Iraq. An Iraqi National Oil Trust should be established to guarantee the oil assets will be used to create a fully functioning infrastructure with financial mechanisms established protect the oil wealth  for the use of the people of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>10. Iraq Economy. Set forth a plan to stabilize Iraq's cost for food and energy, on par to what the prices were before the U.S. invasion and occupation. This would block efforts underway to raise the price of food and energy at a time when most Iraqis do not have the means to meet their own needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>11. Economic Sovereignty. Work with the world community to restore Iraq's fiscal integrity without structural readjustment measures of the IMF or the World Bank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>12. International Truth and Reconciliation. Establish a policy of truth and reconciliation between the people of the United States and the people of Iraq.</paragraph>
