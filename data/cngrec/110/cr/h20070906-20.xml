    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month I was humbled and honored to introduce a resolution honoring the goals and ideals of Gold Star Mothers Day. In 1940, FDR designated the last Sunday in September as Gold Star Mothers Day to commemorate the tremendous sacrifice these courageous mothers have endured on behalf of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year Gold Star Mothers Day will be held on September 30. This brave group of women have turned their personal tragedy into patriotism and caring service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to Georgette Frank of Elk Grove Village, Illinois. Her son, Phil, enlisted in the Marine Corps right out of high school in response to the September 11 attacks, and paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phil believed that the best way to keep America safe was to take the fight to the terrorists. And the last time he saw his mom he said, "Be strong, Mom. No matter what happens, you be strong." That's exactly what Georgette has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phil and his family represent the best and the bravest that our country  has to offer. Many other courageous families have paid this ultimate sacrifice, one we cannot ignore. Please join me in thanking Georgette and all the Gold Star Mothers by cosponsoring this important resolution.</paragraph>
