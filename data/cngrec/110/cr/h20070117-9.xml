    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment with the broken promises of the Democratic leadership. I had high hopes that the promise of unlimited amendments and bipartisanship would prevail in the 110th Congress, but there have been no signs of these promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning, hypocrisy and corruption have reared their ugly heads. The minimum wage bill is touted as a massive relief for the poor, while only 2.5 percent of the population are actually making the minimum wage. This bill was nothing more than a kickback to unions, who use the Federal minimum wage to negotiate their salaries. This increase is a whopping 41 percent over 26 months; not to mention that in the bill American Samoa was exempt, a place where there are two canning plants for  Del Monte Corporation, headquartered in San Francisco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pledge for open debate and unlimited amendments has been completely ignored. Democrats' bills have been rammed through without opportunity for amendments. So many promises made, all of them broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this 100-hour agenda is a pure sham of political showmanship. The Democrats have distorted the North Carolina State motto, which is, "To be rather than to seem." While these bills seem worthwhile, they are nothing more than window dressing for political gain.</paragraph>
