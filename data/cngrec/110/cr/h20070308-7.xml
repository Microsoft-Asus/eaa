    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month I was proud to be part of an important announcement concerning the safety of our children. And thanks to the tremendous generosity of Quest Foundation, the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children was able to establish netsmartz411.org, a first of its kind online service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NetSmartz411 provides a direct line for experts at the National Center for  Concerned Parents. Through this program, questions and concerns about online safety can be answered quickly and accurately. We are all too familiar with stories of Internet predators making their way into our homes with the simple click of a mouse. More and more teenagers are joining social networking Web sites and roaming the Internet freely, with little or no adult supervision.  These Web sites have given predators the freedom to search for pictures, ages, even nearby schools. By empowering more parents than ever before, NetSmartz411 will reinforce our efforts to make the Internet a safer place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for those who want more infor-&#xD0;mation, my colleagues, and would &#xD0;like to find that out, please &#xD0;visit www.netsmartz411.org, or www.missingkids.com.</paragraph>
