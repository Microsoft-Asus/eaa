    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that today I honor Dierks, AR, which will soon be celebrating its 100th anniversary. Dierks is located in Howard County which lies in the southwestern part of my State. It was named after a German family that immigrated to the United States in the mid-1800s. The family established a major sawmill known as Hardscrabble, and when the community was incorporated in 1907, it changed its name to Dierks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Weyerhaeuser Company purchased most of the Dierks' family holdings in 1969. Weyerhaeuser employs some 600 people in Howard County and is one of the county's largest employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dierks is also one of many of Arkansas's fine recreation destinations. Visitors take advantage of Dierks Lake which offers boating, fishing, waterskiing, camping, and sightseeing. Among fishermen, the lake is best known for its large-mouth bass and crappie. Catfish and bream can also be caught in abundance. The beautiful surroundings make it among one of the most scenic spots in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Dierks on its 100th anniversary and in wishing its 1,300 citizens a wonderful day of celebration.</paragraph>
