    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to recognize the fifth anniversary of the Wachovia Championship golf tournament at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, a number of leading North Carolinians gathered to begin the planning for this first-class event. Under the leadership of Quail Hollow president Johnny Harris, tournament chairman Mac Everett, and executive director Kym Hougham, the Wachovia Championship has quickly risen to the top echelon of sporting events in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These leaders desired to create a premier sporting event that would provide a first-class experience for patrons, PGA tour players, and volunteers that at the same time would have a significant economic impact for the Carolinas, showcase my State and region to a national and international television audience, and most importantly raise significant funds for charitable interests in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary beneficiary of the success of the Wachovia Championship is Teach for America. Funds generated from the tournament are used to support the national efforts of this organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past year, I circulated a letter that asked appropriators to fund the Teach for America program at a $15 million level for this fiscal year. Teach for America's goal is to provide students in urban and rural low-income areas with highly qualified teachers in order to eliminate educational inequity. This program is the national corps of top college graduates who commit 2 years to teach in underresourced public schools and become lifelong leaders in the pursuit of educational equity. After  completing their 2-year commitment, 63 percent of the Teach for America alumni continue to work in education. Since 1990, nearly 17,000 college graduates have joined Teach for America, impacting the lives of over 2.5 million students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the efforts that Wachovia is making to support this program. In its first 5 years, the Wachovia Championship has donated over $7.5 million to Teach for America and other charities. This year, to my understanding, the bank's donation to Teach for America is $1 million, and their overall contributions to charities have been $1.95 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, this golf tournament has a much bigger impact on the community than its direct entertainment and economic impact. Through this golf tournament Wachovia has been able to reach out and affect overall society by helping students gain a quality education.</paragraph>
