  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the ethical cloud of the last dozen years has hovered over Congress, I am proud that the new Democratic Members are aggressively pursuing an agenda of ethics reform. Long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced bipartisan legislation with my Oregon colleague, GREG WALDEN, to help establish an independent commission to do the hard work of professionally investigating and evaluating ethics charges. I am hopeful that some provision of that nature will find its way to the floor. The  Democratic leadership has indicated that they will allow votes on key provisions and allow the votes on such proposals, the chips to fall where they may.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident with a wide range of choices that we will be able to have a longer, stronger prohibition from the congressional lobby revolving door and independent oversight. I hope that Members from both sides of the aisle will seize this opportunity to strengthen our ethics framework.</paragraph>
