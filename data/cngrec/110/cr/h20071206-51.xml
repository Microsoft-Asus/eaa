    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a very heavy heart. Yesterday, our Nation witnessed yet another act of gun violence, this time at a mall in Omaha, Nebraska. I know my colleagues from Nebraska are going to be talking about this later. My hearts go out to them for the people that they represented. Eight people were murdered in the rampage. Five others were wounded, two critical. These victims did nothing wrong to deserve their fate. They were mothers, fathers,  sons and daughters. They were just trying to do their shopping, and many of them were working at the mall. But the actions of a crazed gunman changed that in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday's shootings was a terrible tragedy. But unfortunately events like this happen almost every day. Every year we lose over 30,000 people to gun violence. Take a second to think about that. Every year, 30,000 victims. I have been here for 11 years. That is 330,000 people that have been killed because of gun violence while I was in Congress. When you want to put that in perspective, that is the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Three hundred and thirty thousand victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you think about it, what these families are going to be going through in the months ahead with the holidays coming, the pain they are going to be facing, the community, the pain they are going to be facing, I know a lot about that. Tomorrow is December 7. December 7. It was 14 years ago that we had the Long Island Railroad massacre. On that particular day, six people died, one of them my husband. On that day, 19 people were injured, my son critically. Fourteen years later, he is still suffering  from that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, as a Nation, have to start looking how are we going to have this dialogue? I have never tried to do anything to take away the right of someone legally to be able to own a gun, and yet because of the way the laws are in this country and the way we do things backhandedly in this country, it is so easy to get guns. If you want to talk about what the health care costs are, it is over $100 billion a year the health care costs for those that survive these kind of incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think what we could do with that money. Maybe we could educate our young people and reach out to them a little bit better so they don't go into the world of violence. Maybe they won't join gangs. Maybe a good mental health program for this Nation so those like the gunman wouldn't have fallen through the cracks and gotten the help that he needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, as a Nation, on a daily basis, face inconveniences. Tonight when I fly to go home, I will be getting on a plane. I am going to be going through security, all in the name of security and safety. When you go to get your driver's license, long lines. We do this for security and safety. It is an inconvenience. Getting a passport today is an inconvenience. Can't we serve a little bit of inconvenience and come together to make sure that those that are getting guns have the right to have a gun by  passing background checks? Can't we make sure with a little inconvenience that we don't make it so easy for these  guns to float throughout our cities and come into some of our cities illegally? We cannot save everybody. I understand that. But think about if we could cut it down to maybe just 15,000 people a year dying. As far as I am concerned, one person dying is one too many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I promised my son as he was recovering many years ago that I would do whatever I could to prevent another family from not going through what our families did. And here it is 11 years later. Here we had a terrible tragedy yesterday in Nebraska. Not long ago, we had a terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech. Before that, we had another terrible tragedy at another mall in the Midwest. We can think about all these terrible tragedies that are happening more and more not just in our inner cities now but  in places in our country that we never thought we would ever see gun violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation needs to decide what it is going to do to stop this rampage of unnecessary killings of innocent people. Three hundred thirty thousand people killed in the 11 years I have been here, I hope we can do better. I pray for the families. I pray for the communities.</paragraph>
