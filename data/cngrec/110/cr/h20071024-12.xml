  <narrative>COMBATING THE EMERALD ASH BORER -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11938]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today and urge my colleagues to join with me and our colleague Mr. Kirk in cosponsoring <bill type="h" number="3901">H.R. 3901</bill>, the Emerald Ash Borer Municipality Assistance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is an emerald ash borer, you may ask. Well, it is a nasty little bug that has found its way on to our shores, which has a very aggressive disposition towards ash trees in particular. It is a native of China, and there are no known natural predators here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you think of the districts that we all represent, many of them have beautiful canopies of trees that line our streets and create wonderful natural ways all throughout our districts. Yet this bug has shown up in Illinois, my State; Indiana; Michigan; Ohio; Pennsylvania; Maryland and West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one researcher of the Morton Arboretum, which I represent, said, "The emerald ash borer doesn't just kill a majority of the ash trees it encounters; it seems to kill them all."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation creates a revolving loan fund whereby municipalities have access to those moneys, and they use it in order to take on this scourge.</paragraph>
