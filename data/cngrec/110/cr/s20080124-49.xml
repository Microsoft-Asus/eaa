  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - January 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="302">S302</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today Senator McConnell filed cloture on the Rockefeller/Bond substitute amendment. Under the rule, the filing deadline for the first-degree amendments to the substitute amendment is 1 p.m. tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I announced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes tomorrow due to the parliamentary situation created by the minority. We now find ourselves in that situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next vote will occur at 4:30 p.m. on Monday. That vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment. If cloture is not invoked, the way I understand the rules, there will be a vote on our cloture motion that I just filed.</paragraph>
