  <speaking speaker="412263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill>, the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill is a companion bill to <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> that passed out of the House last April.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Fire Administration is an invaluable resource for our Nation's firefighters and for the communities they protect. Through training, data collection, fire education for the public, and for the support for fire-related research and development, the USFA provides critical tools and leadership. To the fire service from small-scale individual tragedies such as house fires and car accidents to the community- and region-wide disasters of terrorist attacks or floods, firefighters are often the  first to arrive on the scene and are the last to leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We depend on our firefighters, but firefighters also depend on us. They depend on the public and on their elected officials to make sure that they have the resources, the equipment and the training they need to do their job. If they are not properly equipped, we are all at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress saw the need to create the USFA in 1973 when the America Burning report called attention to over 6,000 Americans each year who died in fires and to the 100,000 who were injured. Through the leadership of the USFA and others, the number of people killed in fires each year has dropped by 50 percent down to approximately 3,000, and injuries have dropped by 84 percent. While impressive, 3,000 deaths are still far too many, especially when so many of these deaths and injuries are from our  most vulnerable populations--children and the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> is nearly identical to the House bill that passed unanimously on this floor in April. The bill reauthorizes this important agency for 4 years at funding levels that will enable the USFA to fully carry out its mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to highlight that <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> reflects the priorities for this agency as expressed by members of the fire service community at a Science and Technology Committee meeting held last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> authorizes the USFA to focus on the pressing challenges of fighting fires in the wildland-urban interface. As communities spread deeper into fire-prone wildlands, local fire departments are faced with the daunting challenge of fighting fires that differ significantly from those they are trained to tackle. The bill also authorizes the USFA to offer training for fires involving hazardous materials as well as advanced topics on emergency medical services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters today are called upon to respond to an ever broader array of emergencies. This authorization bill gives the USFA the authority to make sure its training program keeps pace with the increasing challenges to the fire service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> is the product of bipartisan and bicameral collaboration, and it is supported by major fire service organizations, including the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resources and leadership of USFA are an essential part of the ability of the fire service to protect our cities, towns and communities. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise, of course, in support of <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill>, a bill reauthorizing the United States Fire Administration. It's a companion bill to <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, which passed the House in April with unanimous support after moving through the Committee on Science and Technology by regular order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act authorizes the activities of the United States Fire Administration for fiscal year 2009 through 2012. USFA provides critical support to our Nation's firefighters through training, through research and development and through logistical support. For instance, the USFA provides firefighter training to over 80,000 firefighters per year; it compiles nationwide data on fire control and prevention activities, and it oversees the fire grants programs that have dramatically improved the capabilities  and the preparedness of our Nation's fire services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an extremely important agency in our committee's jurisdiction. I'd like to thank Mr. Mitchell and Dr. Gingrey, vice chair and ranking member of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee, for their hard work over the past year on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Fire Administration does a wonderful job of providing support to first responders across the country. The reauthorization of this agency is an important priority for me, and I urge the passage of <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I risk in strong support of <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill>, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reauthorizes the United States Fire Administration (USFA) for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for the agency's activities in training, fire education and awareness, data collection, research, and standards development and promotion. <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> provides $291 million in federal funds over this 5-year period, which is consistent with previously authorized levels and allows only for a modest growth in funding, capped at 3 percent in any of the fiscal years covered by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission of USFA is to limit economic and life loss "due to fire and related emergencies, through leadership, advocacy, coordination and support." This organization provides vital assistance in the areas of training, fire education and awareness, and awards grants to a number of local fire departments across the country. Since its inception in 1974, USFA has trained over 1 million firefighters through local delivery courses as well as through the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland.  USFA has provided support critical to reducing deaths and injuries in the U.S. from fire by 25 percent between 1996 and 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> is the Senate companion bill to <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, which the House passed on April 3rd of this year by a vote of 412-0. The Senate bill includes the same authorization amounts and makes minor modifications to the House-passed version that only further improve the legislation. I am proud to say that this legislation has been crafted in both a bipartisan and bicameral way--with community stakeholders--to ensure that it meets the needs of our firefighting community. I commend my colleagues on the  Science Committee in particular Chairman GORDON, Ranking Member Hall and Mr. Mitchell of Arizona, who is the lead sponsor of the House-passed bill--for their diligence in bringing this important legislation to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> authorizes USFA to continue its current operations and expand training and research in a fiscally responsible manner. The bill will provide firefighter training to over 80,000 firefighters per year and facilitate the delivery of education and training programs to firefighters through local training efforts. <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> also aids research into techniques, systems, and equipment to improve fire prevention and control in sparsely developed communities that have been particularly  hard hit by fire in the past few years. This legislation also specifically addresses the issue of fighting fires in an urban-wildland interface--like the wildfires we saw last year in Southern California--by implementing methods to better respond and prepare for fires that move from wildlands to suburban and urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a physician, I am particularly pleased that <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> includes language I offered in the Science Committee to improve emergency medical care by facilitating USFA's coordination with other groups as well as its ability to disseminate information on best-practices for EMS operations and management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters are called upon to extract victims from car crashes, building fires or collapses, and all other emergencies. It is critical that patients receive consistent care under medical direction. While I do not expect USFA to pursue studies into the medical care EMS patients should receive, I believe that this language in <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> will give the Administrator the authority and flexibility to conduct studies into training, system design, and on-scene patient management. This will allow the Administrator  to work with appropriate federal agencies and existing medical services in these local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been a great honor to work with the men and women of our Nation's fire services--including the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the National Volunteer Fire Council--on this important legislation. The United States Fire Administration is a vital link to these first responders and this agency has made substantial contributions to improving fire services throughout the country.  <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> will ensure that USFA remains vibrant and productive in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support and thoughtful contributions to this bill. I urge passage of <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> that will enable the USFA to continue its record of achievement as well as prepare firefighters for the challenges they will face in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Firefighters are often the first--and the last-to leave an emergency scene. Whether it's putting out a house fire or a wildfire--or responding to a terrorist attack or a car accident--we depend on firefighters every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But firefighters also depend on us. They depend on the public and their elected officials to make sure that they have the resources, the equipment and the training they need to do their job. Without those tools, we put them and all of us at unnecessary risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Fire Administration is an invaluable resource for our Nation's firefighters and the communities they protect. Through training, data collection, fire education for the public, and support for fire related research and development, USFA provides critical tools and leadership to the fire service. The resources and leadership of USFA are an essential part of the ability of the fire service to protect our cities, towns, and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters today are called upon to respond to an ever broader array of emergencies. This authorization bill gives USFA the authority to make sure its training program keeps pace with the increasing challenges to the fire service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> reauthorizes this important agency for four years at funding levels that will enable USFA to fully carry out its mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last fall, the Science and Technology Committee's Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, of which I am a member, heard testimony about the priorities of the Nation's fire service community for USFA. This bill directly reflects these priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fighting wildfires in urban areas requires special training--and I'm proud that this legislation enhances Fire Administration training for wildland-urban interface fires. In Arizona, one of the toughest challenges our firefighters face is wildfires in the wildland-urban interface.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also authorizes USFA to focus on the pressing challenges of fires involving hazardous materials as well as advanced topics in emergency medical services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the product of bipartisan collaboration and is supported by major fire service organizations, including the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate passed <bill type="s" number="2606">S. 2606</bill> unanimously on September 18, 2008. I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation, bringing it one step closer to becoming law.</paragraph>
