  <narrative>ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT -- (Senate - December 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15647">S15647</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I support the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which sets the U.S. energy policy on the right path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly supportive of the critical improvements that were made in this bill to raise vehicle fuel economy standards while protecting American jobs. It is vitally important to my hometown of Janesville, WI, and to other hard-working communities across the country that Congress strike the right balance on this issue. Since the Senate considered the Energy bill earlier this year, I have worked with my colleagues to ensure that the final version includes strong but reasonable CAFE standards.  I am glad that together we have accomplished that feat, and the bill has the support of interests as varied as the UAW, General Motors, and environmental groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also support the bill's renewable fuel standard, which will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, of which 21 billion will come from advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. The bill also includes language I cosponsored urging that 25 percent of energy come from renewable sources by 2025 and setting requirements for improved energy efficiency for buildings, appliances, and lighting. The bill also includes an important provision, based on a bill I cosponsored,  that makes it unlawful for an individual to knowingly manipulate the price of oil or gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am, however, disappointed that after hard work and negotiations that produced a good, balanced energy bill, a minority of Senators repeatedly blocked the bill. It is unfortunate that to overcome this Republican roadblock, we had to remove the renewable electricity standard and the energy tax provisions--these new or extended renewable energy tax incentives were fully offset, so they would not have added to our deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, on balance, the version of the bill that the Senate passed is a positive step. It moves us away from our dependence on oil, increases our  energy security, encourages renewable energy and energy efficiency, and supports hard-working families and communities around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's Energy bill finally moves past the misguided debates of previous Congresses and the fiscally and environmentally irresponsible proposals that were considered and passed in recent years. The United States is at an important juncture. By supporting the Energy bill, I am supporting a new direction for our Nation's energy policy: one that encourages renewable energy, conservation of the resources we have, and American innovation.</paragraph>
