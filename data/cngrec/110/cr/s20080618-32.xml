    <paragraph>Madam President, I pay tribute to an exceptional officer in the U.S. Air Force, MG Michael A. Collings upon his retirement after more than 33 years of distinguished service. Throughout his career, General Collings has personified the Air Force core values of integrity, selfless service, and excellence in the many missions the Air Force provides in defense of our nation. It is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided  the Air Force and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Collings entered the U.S. Air Force as a graduate of Southern Illinois University's Reserve Officer Training Corps program in 1974. His career has spanned a variety of operational assignments and major command staff functions. A command pilot with more than 2600 hours in the T-37, T-38 and F-16, General Collings spent more than 10 years in the cockpit, instructing in the T-37, F-16 and at the U.S. Air Force Fighter Weapons School. Moving to the logistics field in 1987, General Collings  has served on the staff at Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, Washington DC, Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, Hickam Air Force Base, HI, and Headquarters Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base, VA. He has commanded two squadrons, two groups, and two wings including the 82nd Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas and the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Robins Air Force Base, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His assignments have increased in scope and responsibility, culminating in his current assignment as Chief, Office of Military Cooperation, Egypt. As the Senior U.S. Defense Representative to Egypt, General Collings leads six divisions responsible for all aspects of the security assistance mission in Egypt. In addition to providing advice and assistance to the Government of Egypt on a wide range of military procurement and training issues, the Office of Military Cooperation serves as a liaison  between the Egyptian Ministry of Defense and United States Central Command, coordinating the planning of joint military exercises throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his career, General Collings has served the U.S. Air Force and our Nation with excellence, distinction, and unwavering integrity. His exceptional leadership skills have been evident throughout his career as he repeatedly demonstrated superb command and operational leadership, a brilliant and innovative vision for his unit's future, and an unmatched loyalty to his faith, people and country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Collings will retire from the U.S. Air Force on August 1, 2008 after 33 years and 1 month of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of Congress, the country, and the State of Georgia, I thank General Collings, his wife Jan, and their entire family for the commitment and sacrifices they have made throughout his honorable service. Congratulations on completing an outstanding and exemplary military career.</paragraph>
