    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, article I, section 2 of the Constitution states that "the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States." It goes on to say: "No person shall be a representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in spite of the Constitution and what it says today, this new majority will pass a bill to provide a vote, by law, not constitutional amendment, a vote in this House for the delegate from the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I support, strongly, voting rights for residents of D.C. The proper way to do that, the constitutional way, is to return residential area in the District of Columbia to Maryland. It respects the supreme law of the land of the Constitution. Even the Democrat chairman, Peter Rodino of the Judiciary Committee in the 95th Congress, said: "If the citizens of the District are to have voting representation in Congress, a constitutional amendment is essential. Statutory action alone will not suffice."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why would this new majority pass a law so clearly violative of the Constitution? Because they can. It's an arrogance and hypocrisy that the American people recognize, and they are watching.</paragraph>
