  <narrative>MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE JOSEPH MINISH OF NEW JERSEY -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14129]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like for us to pause from votes for just a few moments in order to recognize one of our congressional brothers who passed away last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, last Wednesday, former Representative Joseph Minish died at the age of 91. We have lost a great man, a great New Jerseyan and true champion of the working class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Throop, Pennsylvania, Joe was the son of a coal miner. Joe never went to college, but he served in the Army during World War II and subsequently settled in Newark, New Jersey, where he worked as a machine operator and joined the staff of the Electrical Workers Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was first elected in 1962. Joe represented Essex County in the House for 22 years. Throughout his tenure, he displayed talent, intelligence and capability. More important than anything, Madam Speaker, he showed kindness to everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe was always looking out for the little guy. And after all, isn't that why we are all here? He was unassuming. He was a humble man. But he fought with intensity on behalf of the underdog, and he is an example of the very best of what public service is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He believed in what Tip O'Neill believed, and that is that all politics is local. He was legendary back home for the constituent services he provided. He did it with little flair, asked nothing in return, and just got the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Washington, Joe pushed for truth-in-lending laws and rallied against the price gouging of consumers. He was an advocate for food safety reforms, including tougher Food and Drug Administration regulation, as well as for greater access to health care for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent part of Joe's old district, and as a long-time resident of West Orange, New Jersey, Joe was a constituent of mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can only hope that I represent the good people of my district with the same decency in character that Joe Minish displayed throughout his tenure. He reached across the aisle. He was a giant among men. We will miss you, my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask that the House take a moment of silence in his honor.</paragraph>
