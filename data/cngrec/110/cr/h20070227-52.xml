  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, like my colleague from Kentucky, I rise to honor former Congressman Gene Snyder. Because we find ourselves both as a Congress and a country working to dig ourselves out of a divisive partisan trench, which in recent years has been characterized by petty attacks and contentiousness, my constituents may be surprised to know that I counted Gene Snyder as a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene, who was always more interested in the public than publicity, told me a story about a persistent reporter who badgered him about a meeting he wanted to cover. Gene didn't want the reporter at the meeting and refused to disclose the location. So when Gene spotted the reporter in his rearview mirror tailing him to the meeting, Gene said to heck with it. He told his aide to head for the mountains, and led the reporter on a 100-mile wild goose chase through Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as a former member of the news media, I won't applaud that tactic, but I admire the competitive spirit it exemplified. In any event, that was the last time that reporter tried to get the best of Gene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Gene and I enjoyed each other's company, you would be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of issues upon which the honorable Gene Snyder and I agreed in the political arena. But political issues are only one part of this job, the other being serving one's constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far apart as we sat on the ideological spectrum, Gene Snyder's model of constituent service is one I aspire to closely emulate. In his three decades of service, Congressman Snyder set the example of how to serve a district. He set the bar, and he set it high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Gene held my seat, we in Louisville knew that we had a representative with an open door and an open ear for all of us. If it concerned our community, no matter, big or small, was unworthy of his attention. He welcomed us warmly, shared a laugh, and left us with a feeling that something would soon be done to address anything from a clerical glitch to the need for a new highway. Inevitably, and remarkably, for an age when distrust of a power-hungry government dominated, the issue would be  handled effectively and expediently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I now work to institute my own open door policy, I am consistently cognizant that I follow the example set by a predecessor and a friend, Gene Snyder. I look to him has a fervent believer that democracy stems not from politicians, but from the citizens we represent, and I endeavor to capture that spirit as he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene Snyder was my representative, he was my friend, and he will be greatly missed. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring his life and service to his constituents.</paragraph>
