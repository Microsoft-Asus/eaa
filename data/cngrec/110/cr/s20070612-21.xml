    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to note that exactly 20 years ago, on June 12, 1987, President Ronald Reagan stood at the Berlin wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and issued his--issued liberty's--famous challenge to Soviet tyranny:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although that speech was deeply rooted in the Cold War, and is indeed seen as a significant milestone in that war, it also spoke larger truths. President Reagan also said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is the victor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Reagan was not just addressing West Berlin, and the Soviet General Secretary, he was addressing the world, and posterity. He was expounding on the American ideal of liberty and justice for all. He was not addressing a regional problem, but mankind's aspirations. It was a triumphant moment for Americans and our ideals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, I have previously submitted a resolution, <bill type="sc" number="1">S. Con. Res. 1</bill>, calling for an artistic rendering of that moment in time to be painted into the Capitol, along with the other significant scenes of our Nation's past. As we walk through the building today, we can see scenes from the Nation's founding, from the Civil War, our westward expansion, even the Moon landing and Challenger astronauts. I would like to also see Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate. I think it would be entirely appropriate  to have this image added. It would be an important reminder of the struggle this Nation undertook. It would stand for the millions of Americans who did their part for nearly half a century in that struggle, both military and civilian. And it would testify to the greatness of our Nation, and the greatness of our 40th President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am adding cosponsors to that resolution. I urge my remaining colleagues to join me as well. This is worth doing.</paragraph>
