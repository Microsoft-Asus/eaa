    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last Tuesday the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, editorialized: "After more than 5 years of impasse and hostility, the patient multinational diplomacy launched by President Bush has borne its first fruit in North Korea. The intricate deal reached last spring for a path to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is advancing with the shutdown of a reactor that produces plutonium for the dictatorship's nuclear weapons program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It signals that North Korea is committed, so far, to a step-by-step bettering of relations with its neighbors and particularly with the United States. The shutdown was confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, I participated in a rare delegation visiting Pyongyang, and I am grateful that "the six-nation framework devised by Mr. Bush and ably hosted by China ..... has led to the current progress." I saw firsthand where North Korea can benefit by opening its economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th and the Glasgow airport attack.</paragraph>
