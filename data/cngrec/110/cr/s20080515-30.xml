    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks today about Alabama's State champion and national finalist in the "We the People" competition. Vestavia Hills High School placed fourth in the national We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution national finals, held in Washington, DC. This impressive competition, headed by the Center for Civic Education, engaged young people in the fundamental ideals and values of American constitutional government.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate Amy Maddox, the teacher who led this fine team. Teachers shape the future, and I appreciate Ms. Maddox's investment in these students. As a former educator and the father of three children, I have a great admiration for educators, and I am grateful that educators like Ms. Maddox are making a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Janice Cowin, the executive director of the Alabama Center for Law and Civic Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the efforts of students, teachers, and community leaders who made this accomplishment possible. Vestavia Hills High School is an exceptional school and has represented Alabama well. I encourage these students to continue pursuing a deep understanding of the Constitution and our Government. It is important that we raise up quality leaders that will serve our country in years to come.</paragraph>
