  <narrative>LET'S LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3753]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tonight we had a bipartisan vote to suspend deposits in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It's a great bipartisan vote. I join with my Democrat colleagues in supporting this legislation. The reason why it works is because it decreases the amount of consumption of oil here in the United States, thereby bringing prices down because it's the control of supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, likewise, I would ask my Democrat colleagues to join with me in increasing domestic production and refining capacity here in the United States, which is another way to bring prices down for our consumers. We can do this in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask that we join together in a bipartisan vote so we can lower gas prices for the short term and for the long term.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
