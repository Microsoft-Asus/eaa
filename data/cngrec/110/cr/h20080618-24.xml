    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle and they ask, what's the Democrats' plan for energy? Well, with two oilmen in the White House, it's obvious what the Republicans' plan has been, and it has been a constant increase in the price of gas since the day George Bush and DICK CHENEY took office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 68 million acres under lease for oil production not being used, being hoarded, being kept out of the market. It's a red herring to say we need to drill more. It's available. What we really need to do is get off the addiction to oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have learned this lesson before. We don't need to keep learning it. We need to have research and development in new ways to power this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, with just tweaking the battery of a Prius, the lab reached 100 miles to the gallon. We can no longer be dependent on the Middle East for oil production. We have to change this Nation and its energy plans. To do so is good for national security, good for the climate and good for jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to change the direction of this Nation.</paragraph>
