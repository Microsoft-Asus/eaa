    <paragraph>As a strong supporter of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, I wanted to take a few moments to speak about this important bill, which we passed earlier today in the House, and how delighted I am and my constituents are for its passage. It is a historic step forward in our goal toward reaching energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> raised CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, cutting oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day, also, eliminating greenhouse gases equivalent to 28 million cars from our roads. That's 28 million cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among many important additional initiatives, it includes new energy efficiency standards to reduce demand. It extends renewable energy tax credits for solar and other renewable sources. It includes a renewable fuels standard that contains safeguards to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment. It also contains a renewable electricity standard, requiring utilities to get 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. It also assists and empowers small businesses to cut costs  and scale up innovative energy solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will create thousands of new good-paying green jobs and build on the work that has begun in places like the Ella Baker Center in my district in Oakland, California, which is helping to lead the green jobs revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the right steps forward to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to save our constituents money, and to fight global warming. Most importantly, it echoes the innovative steps that have already been taken by individual cities, States and districts like my district in the East Bay of California, Alameda County, to be specific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, the California Bay Area, and my district in particular, are in the forefront of the innovation and research on alternative energy climate change and the environment. Ongoing research into alternative and renewable energy at the University of California at Berkley, one of the premier public universities in the country, of course I am an alma mater of the University of California at Berkley and very proud of that, we hold the promise of a cleaner and brighter future for our children,  our country and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Businesses in my district have also taken the lead in greening their activities to reduce waste, improve energy efficiency, and save water, minimizing the impact on our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Innovative programs like the Ella Baker Center, which I already mentioned, and funded in part through the City of Oakland, are also training youth in my district about the importance of environmental stewardship and providing them with new job opportunities and new career paths. Community-based organizations in my district have also taken the lead in advocating for environmental justice and equity for all of our constituents. Together, my community is at the forefront of a robust environmental  movement that is quite literally changing the world for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act will help these grass-roots efforts expand and grow through Federal initiatives designed to put the United States on a path to energy sustainability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am very pleased that the House passed <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, and I look forward to its final passage by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, we have the City of Albany, Berkley, Piedmont, Oakland, California, Ashland, Cherryland, Fairview, Castro Valley, unbelievable innovations which this bill will certainly support and enhance. So I urge the President not to reject this proposal and hope that he signs the bill when it reaches his desk.</paragraph>
