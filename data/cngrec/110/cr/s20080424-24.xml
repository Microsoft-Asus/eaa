  <narrative>VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (Senate - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3377">S3377</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to commend Chairman Akaka on the legislation that was passed in the Senate earlier today, <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes a number of commonsense improvements to the benefits packages we offer America's veterans. I am pleased to have voted for this bill as it came out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I am also pleased to have supported it on the floor today. It is long past due to give our disabled veterans the ability to purchase affordable life insurance. That is what this bill does. It provides up to $50,000 in life insurance for any veteran younger than the age of 65 who has a service-connected  disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also adds a host of new benefits to help critically injured service men and women get their households refurbished if they become disabled. That can mean putting in wheelchair ramps, remodeling a kitchen or a bathroom, and countless other chores. Again, it is a small measure, but for a soldier who has lost an arm or a leg or a marine who has suffered severe burns, it means the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is long past time to increase burial benefits to help families deal with the growing costs of providing a final resting place for their veteran loved ones. This bill does that by authorizing double the current allowance for the burial of a veteran who dies from a service-connected disability to $4,000. It also triples the $300 benefit for nonservice connected disabilities. With the average funeral cost now around $6,000, this is a small gesture to the loved ones of our veterans, but it matters  a great deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time of record national debt and chronic annual  budget deficits, I am particularly pleased this bill is deficit-neutral. It does not increase taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all the good in the bill, it is little wonder the Veterans' Benefit Enhancement Act is supported by every major veterans service organization. This bill passed out of the VA Committee unanimously last summer, and I am pleased by the bipartisan support it got today. We now need to turn our attention to the veterans health care legislation that I am told will follow this bill. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our children sign up for military service, whether they do it at a local recruiting office or by going to a service academy or anything in-between, we make a deal with them. We ask them to put their lives on the line. We ask them to serve and to sacrifice at an increasingly difficult pace. We ask them to fight wars. We ask them to keep peace and to keep our Nation free and they go. They go and they do a better job than any other military in the world. In return, we promise that when their  service is over, we will care for them and compensate them if they have been injured in their service to our country. With our Nation now at war, we have a great moral obligation to do right by the men and women who serve our country in harm's way. This legislation helps keep the promise to our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other point I wish to add that relates to what the senator from Michigan and the Senator from Utah talked about. I have only been here for 15 or 16 months, but I will tell my colleagues that one thing I have noticed and one thing that has surprised me over the last year and a quarter is we debate whether to debate all too much. The fact is, whether we agree or disagree on an issue, what is important is we have an opportunity to vote on an issue--to make our stand and vote on an issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happened last week was a prime example, where we had a transportation bill--corrections to a transportation bill--and we spent all week because it was being delayed and delayed. I sat in the chair last Thursday night when the majority leader, the Democratic leader, came down to the floor and said: I have to file cloture on this veterans' bill--the one we passed--because I have approached the minority and they have not gotten back to me and I do not want to take the chance of wasting a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have work to do here. We have done some good work today, and I hope we can have many more days such as today, where we can vote on legislation that impacts the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
