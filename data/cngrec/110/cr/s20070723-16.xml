  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="HONORING WARREN HERRON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record of the Senate my friend Warren Herron, who is a great Georgian, a great American, and a great citizen of Cobb County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren Herron was the most important positive influence on my decision to enter public life. His active political participation and bipartisan approach is the role model I aspire to emulate to this day. He has given unselfishly of himself to make his community better through his work, his church and the Republican Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren was the first chairman of the Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration when it was created in 1985. As chairman, a post he held until January 1993, he shaped the organization through the creation of its policies and bylaws. He was known as a guiding force who led his team to a higher level by example, and his contributions can still be seen in the board today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the Senate the contributions of Warren Herron to Cobb County and the State of Georgia.</paragraph>
