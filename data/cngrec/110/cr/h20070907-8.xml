  <narrative>BORDER SECURITY AND THE ALTAR OF GREED -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10247]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it appears that in spite of Federal law that requires close inspection of vehicles and identification of people entering the United States, in the City of El Paso, Texas, border and Customs officials have been ordered to ignore some inspections. This Get-to-America-Quick plan requires that if pedestrian lines get too long, only 30 percent of them are to be questioned. If vehicular traffic waiting time is too long, then inspectors are to ignore some basic inspections for  drugs and radioactive material.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Sarah Carter of the Washington Times, in some cases only every fifth driver and his documents are verified, all this in the name of letting more foreign nationals into the United States faster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Well, it seems some businesses are complaining the delays hurt their profits. So Federal bureaucrats are making border inspection officers ignore security, all in the name of the almighty dollar, or shall I say peso.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is yet another example of the incompetent attitude and lack of will on government bureaucrats to secure the American border. American border security should not be sacrificed on the altar of greed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
