    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must continue to open markets to encourage American companies to innovate and compete with our global counterparts. This grows our economy and creates jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to represent a district in Washington State that integrates our Nation's leading technology innovators with a vibrant and highly productive small business community. Opening new global markets gives them the incentives to improve their products, produce more goods, and employ more American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen these jobs created in Washington State firsthand, with trade accounting for one of every three jobs in the State of Washington. Free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South Korea are currently pending before Congress. We cannot allow these important agreements to languish in committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues in the majority to stop the delays, pass these free trade agreements and renew trade promotion authority. Let's advance the trade measures needed to grow our economy, create jobs and improve our relations with global partners.</paragraph>
