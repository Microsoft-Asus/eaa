  <narrative>FISA -- (Senate - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12949">S12949</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the majority leader's comments and admonitions about the coming telecommunications surveillance intercept bill, otherwise known as the FISA bill, I think what the majority leader said was absolutely essential, that the work product that comes out of the Intelligence Committee and then the Judiciary Committee be bipartisan in nature. We do not want to repeat what happened in the first week of August, in which there was so much misinformation and  mistrust on both sides of the aisle. It was very difficult to cobble together a bill, which the intelligence community told us was essential because of the increased traffic, which is otherwise defined as increased communications of some indication that there might be the planning stages of an additional attack upon the United States. In that atmosphere of warnings, we were told we had to pass a bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in that crisis atmosphere that a piece of legislation was cobbled together in the midst of mistrust and misinformation on this floor. But the safeguard was put on it that what was passed and ultimately signed into law by the President was only good for 6 months. In other words, it sunsetted or ceased to exit at the end of 6 months. Therefore, in now constructing the permanent law, we need to come together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this Senator, a member of the Intelligence Committee, has been quite firm in my insistence to both of the leaders of our committee--Senator Rockefeller, the chairman, and Senator Bond, the vice chairman--that they come out with an agreed-upon, bipartisan piece of legislation to protect the rights of American citizens, their civil liberties, their privacy and, at the same time, to be able to utilize instruments of the Government of the United States to be able to go after  the people who want to do us harm. I believe that the agreement has pretty well been reached between Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond. What is potentially going to hold up an agreement is the question of what kind of immunity should be given to the telecommunications companies who had, at the request of the U.S. Government, after September 11, 2001, allowed their databases to be used for the purposes of trying to determine who the bad guys were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everything I am saying has all been out in the press. It is well established. The House has taken a position of not wanting to have any immunity for the telephone companies on a retroactive basis. They already have immunity on a going-forward basis as a result of what we passed in August, and that is now law. It is my hope that the two leaders of the Intelligence Committee will be able to get agreement on what that immunity should be, and that will be a large part of the discussion that is supposed  to take place in the markup in the Intelligence Committee tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the majority leader, Senator Reid, said, it is very important we get this right and that we get this done soon in order that it can then go from the Intelligence Committee to the Judiciary Committee and that it can come out of the Judiciary Committee, come to the full Senate and then a conference committee can iron out the differences between the House and the Senate versions and then get a final product to the President for him to sign into law. It is important it be done now in  a timely manner, instead of waiting until the last minute, when the clock is going to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>strike 12 on the tolling of the time of the 6 months that the law will cease to exist. This ought to be done under the cool deliberation of making it right instead of being forced into decisions at the last moment because time is running out. It is my hope, and it is certainly going to be my intent, to try to help this process along as a member of the Intelligence Committee.</paragraph>
