  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the sad truth is that we have an epidemic of working poor in this country. These are Americans who work 40 to 60 hours a week and sometimes 7 days a week, yet can't afford the basic necessities. At $5.15 per hour, a full-time minimum wage worker makes less than $11,000 a year, which is less than most of us make in a month. These aren't just teenagers working part time. Most minimum-wage workers are actually hardworking disadvantaged adults. Each  day these working poor are faced with the impossible decision of having to choose between food, clothing, shelter, medicine and utility bills. No American who works hard for a living should have to make those types of choices. We cannot continue to look away while hardworking Americans linger in poverty. This isn't just an economic issue, it is an ethical and moral issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Democratic leadership for their dedication to this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this raise for the millions of Americans who deserve it.</paragraph>
