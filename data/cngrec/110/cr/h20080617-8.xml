  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to welcome a group from my hometown, Olivet Baptist Church, hosted by their pastor, Kenneth Whalum, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Whalum's father, Pastor Kenneth Whalum, Sr., passed away last year, and this House named the post office on South Third Street, the main post office in Memphis, in his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a city councilman, an outstanding community leader, a clergyman of renown, and my friend. He has three sons--two musicians, one of whom is Kirk Whalum, as many of you know from his saxophone playing--and then his son, Pastor Kenneth Whalum, Jr., who serves on the Memphis City School Board and who is a political and ecumenical leader in the City of Memphis as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I welcome Olivet Baptist Church to the House of Representatives, and I give praise to them for helping me get here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
