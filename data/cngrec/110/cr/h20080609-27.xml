  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act, which I introduced earlier this year. This legislation will reauthorize the sole source of Federal funding for at least 1 million young people who find themselves homeless or unaccompanied each year. Some of those children are born homeless, but most run away to escape mental, emotional or physical abuse. More than a third of them are victims of sexual abuse in the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although they escape terrible conditions at home, for most, what is waiting for them on the street is no better. These youths are raped or assaulted at rates two to three times the national average, they are seven more times likely to contract HIV, and a third of them attempt suicide. For these young people, hope is a distant concept and the future is little more than a dead end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation is bleak, but the solutions are within our grasp. My hometown of Louisville, thanks to organizations like Safe Place and Boys Haven, has set the standard for helping homeless youth find a home, get an education and rediscover their futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invited Rusty Booker to testify before the Education and Labor Committee last year. Rusty, a fellow Louisvillian, ran away from an abusive home at the age of 12 and went through five different foster homes before finding his path at Safe Place. Rusty showed us that we have the answers, we have the tools to eliminate childhood homelessness and disconnection, but only if we choose to use them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the opportunity we have before us today, because despite the tremendous work of our service organizations, the funds and personnel to accommodate the basic needs of our Nation's runaway and homeless youth are far short of meeting the demand and the required infrastructure is simply not in place. We need to do more than just contain these children while we have them. We must set them on a path to adulthood, prepared for the workplace and ready for the world, without dragging the dead weight  of a history of neglect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act will refocus our resources and give America a real shot at eradicating youth homelessness forever. Thanks to the groundwork laid in Louisville, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act won't simply extend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act until 2013. It will provide significant improvements and much-needed expansions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Addressing the critical funding shortfall, this legislation will dramatically increase the reauthorization for Runaway and Homeless Youth Act funding to $150 million per year, ensuring that the resources are in place for community-serving organizations to reach every child in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also increase the basic center program allotments for small States, make public entities eligible for street outreach program funds, establish grantee performance standards, and finally create a process for developing a national runaway and homeless youth research and evaluation agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The progress that we have made in the past year is significant. In fiscal year 2007, 740,000 young people were helped by our HYA programs. But more significant will be the advances down the road. As we work to restore faith in this Nation's future, we must build an America where every child has a chance to learn, succeed, and at the very least have a place to call home.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the lead Republican sponsor of <bill type="h" number="5524">H.R. 5524</bill>, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008. I am pleased to be here with my good friend the gentleman from Kentucky, Congressman John Yarmuth, as we consider this important bill reauthorizing and strengthening the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, set to expire this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, each year, between 1 and 3 million children in the United States find themselves on their own and on the street. Throughout our Nation, local shelters, like NCO Youth &amp; Family Services and Aunt Martha's in my district rely on Federal support to keep these children safe and off the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress first enacted the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in 1974 and has regularly reauthorized it to ensure a basic level of support for unaccompanied youth. To meet the needs of these children, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act authorizes three major programs: The Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program and the Street Outreach Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Basic Center Program, or BCP, provides youth with emergency short-term shelter, food, clothing, counseling and referrals for health care. The BCP seeks to reunite young people with their families whenever possible or to locate appropriate alternative placements. In 2006, BCP grantees served more than 48,000 youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Transitional Living Program, or TLP, assists older homeless youth in  developing skills and resources to promote their independence and prevent future dependency on social services. In 2006, TLP grantees provided services to more than 3,600 youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Street Outreach Program provides emergency shelter and related services to young people who have been or are at the risk of being sexually abused or exploited. The goal of these efforts is to inform young people about services that can help them find suitable housing and address the problems that lead them to be on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the Street Outreach Program served over 619,000 youth. The bill before us today reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act through fiscal year 2013. Under the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services would establish grantee performance standards and provide a periodic estimate of the incidence of youth homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5524">H.R. 5524</bill> also creates a National Homeless Youth Awareness Campaign that will focus on increasing awareness about the issues facing runaway and homeless youth and the tools available for preventing runaway and homeless youth situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the prevalence of homelessness is difficult to measure, it is estimated that about 5 to nearly 8 percent of youth experience homelessness each year. More can and must be done. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act will strengthen Federal efforts to keep our children safe and off the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to share the story of one of these kids, Dennis, a constituent of mine, whose life changed as a result of one of these programs strengthened in this bill, the Transitional Living Program. As a senior in high school, Dennis began to isolate himself from family and friends. He was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, and even though he was prescribed medicine, he didn't take it. According to Dennis, he felt "walled off to a point where it just crushes in on you, it  was like someone turned off the switch. It was very, very difficult to see joy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After months of bitterly fighting with his parents, Dennis packed up his car and ran away. He stayed on the couch of friends and family for the remainder of his senior year in high school and continued to deteriorate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, that year, Dennis learned of the NCO Youth and Family Services Transitional Living Program, and he decided to use it for housing. He needed a place to stay. But the program was not just housing, it taught him to manage his disorder, as well as training and managing, budget, cooking and cleaning, monitoring his credit, applying for a job, securing transportation and locating an apartment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program helped Dennis secure a job, giving him the hope and determination to make something of himself. After successful completion of the Transitional Living Program, where is he now? Well, Dennis is an Army private serving honorably in Kuwait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Dennis, without the program, he would be half dead now. He says, "If I hadn't come to NCO, I think I wouldn't have made it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the stories like this and the success that we have seen, I am really proud to join Mr. Yarmuth, my fellow sponsor, in support of this bill. This bill is about helping homeless children, and I strongly support it and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to start thinking about how to help families facing the prospect of homelessness because they are being squeezed by high energy prices, rising prices for gasoline needed to get to and from a job, for the food needed to feed their families and even for natural gas to keep their homes warm in the winter and for electricity needed to keep them cool in the summer, we are putting enormous pressure on the American families that can least afford it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to helping homeless kids, this Congress must take action to increase the supply of oil, reduce the price of gasoline and support the development of advanced energy technologies and alternatives to oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this past weekend, the national average price of gasoline hit $4 a gallon for the first time. Well, I can assure you that for my constituents in the Chicago area, $4 for gas would be moving in the right direction. We have been paying well over $4 a gallon for weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I urge my colleagues to support this bill today, I also urge this House to take action to address the high price of energy generally and gasoline in particular, which, if left unchecked, will certainly increase the ranks of homelessness in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I thank my colleague, Mr. Yarmuth, for working with me to produce the bipartisan bill we are considering today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5524">H.R. 5524</bill>, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my two good friends, Representative JOHN YARMUTH from Kentucky and Representative JUDY BIGGERT from Illinois, for their strong leadership on this important legislation to my district in south Texas and to the whole Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An estimated 2.8 million youth under the age of 17 experience a homeless situation each year. Many more young adults under the age of 24 find themselves without a place to call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's homeless youth are exposed to some of the harshest elements imaginable. They are exposed to the harsh elements of hot and cold weather. These homeless youth are exposed to the harsh elements of crime, of abuse and exploitation on the street. They are vulnerable to illness and physical trauma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These homeless youth are deprived of the protective and nurturing elements that come with a home and a strong supportive family. They are robbed of the supports necessary for a productive adulthood. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act will reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which provides support to youth through basic centers and shelters, transitional living programs and street outreach. This is the only Federal law targeted solely to unaccompanied youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and would like to thank the authors for including many of the provisions to improve the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act from legislation I introduced last summer. <bill type="h" number="3409">H.R. 3409</bill>, the Place to Call Home Act, is included in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homelessness among our Nation's youth will persist until all sectors of society, including the Congress, declare that a safe place to live and a connection to permanent and loving families and communities are basic needs we will ensure for all young people. This legislation is one significant step in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="5524">H.R. 5524</bill>, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that, I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation that for more than 1 million young people each year could mean the difference between continuing to live on the streets without hope and finding a path to independent adulthood that begins with a place to call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Miller, Chairwoman McCarthy, and especially Representative Biggert for her hard work and dedication to this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of <bill type="h" number="5524">H.R. 5524</bill>, The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which is under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee which I chair, the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. Yarmuth, the bill's sponsor, is on my subcommittee and it was a pleasure to work with him on this reauthorization. Each  member of my subcommittee is both passionate and committed to improving the lives of our Nation's children.  In this case, Mr. Yarmuth is seeking to assist some of our Nation's most vulnerable youth, those who run away from home or who have no home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a travesty that this situation exists in our Nation--that children find themselves in situations where they need to leave their home for any number of reasons--they are thrown out, have been abused, and face other challenges at home. Worse yet, too many of our Nation's foster care youth find themselves released from the system at or around age 18 and are left to fend for themselves without guidance or little to no assistance, and they become part of the over one million runaway or homeless  youth in our Nation. These resilient youth seek caring adults, stability, and the ability to see their future as different from their present situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization improves the basic central programs, street outreach programs, and the transitional living program. As we heard in a hearing in my subcommittee, it is just too easy to look away and dismiss the problem or accept that it is inevitable that there will be homeless youth. We see it, acknowledge it, and do nothing about it. However, if we dismiss or tolerate the problem of runaway and homeless youth, I think that we can easily expect that we will see these youth in other social  systems where they may stay for the rest of their lives. Helping these youth in the here and now is both intervention and prevention. We must maintain a long-term vision for our Nation's youth. Investing in all children at an early age is clearly necessary, but we also must attend to our older youth who face challenges that neither you nor I have experienced as teenagers and young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Yarmuth has worked very hard with the community that works with runaway and homeless youth to create a strong reauthorization of these programs. He has included the development and implementation of performance standards to be used in the grant making process, to better allow the Family and Youth Services Bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate each program and fund the best of the best. You see, these programs are good, and the competition  is strong for any funding that is available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote yes on <bill type="h" number="5524">H.R. 5524</bill>, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act today. It is an investment in our Nation's most vulnerable youth and in all of America's young people. They seek caring adults and opportunities to improve their lives at home and their futures. If we help these youth now, we prevent them from entering into child welfare and juvenile justice systems, each path fraught with challenges. I think that we can all come together to change the lives of children for the  better.</paragraph>
