  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from New York (Mr. McNulty) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400268" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President is going to come here tonight and by all indications he is going to call for a new era of cooperation. I hope that comes to pass. But that is not his record. On Iraq, he continues to ignore the American people, both parties in this Congress, and even his own generals. And our troops continue to suffer the consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On energy policy, I have been in this chamber for the last several years when the President has spoken, I believe eloquently, about the need to develop alternative sources of energy. Then he gave huge multibillion-dollar tax cuts to the oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health insurance is also a subject he is going to address tonight. In the words of former Governor Al Smith of New York, "Let's look at the record." When this President took office, there were 39 million people uninsured in this country. Today that number is 47 million, up by 8 million people. We're going in the wrong direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that in the year 2007, from the White House and from this administration, we get less talk and more action.</paragraph>
