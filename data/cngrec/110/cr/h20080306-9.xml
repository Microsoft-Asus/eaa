    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true humanitarian from my congressional district, Mike Daly. In 2007, Mike retired as principal of the Black Hawk Area Education Center in East Moline, Illinois, ending a remarkable 35-year career in special education and public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Mike demonstrated tremendous passion and dedication. He successfully established partnerships between local businesses, service organizations, and the special needs community to provide opportunities for his students, such as competing in the Special Olympics, and always believing that communities should not have boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike's tireless efforts have touched the lives of thousands of people and their families, and I am proud to have the opportunity to represent him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike, thank you for your work, your commitment to others, and your efforts to make your community a better place for everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish you the best in your retirement, and may you continue to find fulfillment in helping others.</paragraph>
