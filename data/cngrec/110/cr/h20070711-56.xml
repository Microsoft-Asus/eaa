    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise to introduce <bill type="hr" number="535">H. Res. 535</bill> in tribute to David Ray Ritcheson, a survivor of one of the most horrific hate crimes in the history of Texas, and recognizing his efforts in promoting Federal legislation to combat hate crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Ray Ritcheson, a Mexican American, was a friendly and cheerful student at Klein Collins High School in the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas and a popular and talented football athlete who was loved and admired by his family and friends. However, on April 23, 2006, at the age of 16, David Ray Ritcheson was severely assaulted while attending a party in Spring, Texas by skinheads who assaulted and violated him because of his race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was through his suffering of this enormous tragedy, having gone through more than 30 surgeries to restore his appearance and regain the  normal use of his body, that this young man stayed steadfast and came to the Judiciary Committee in 2007 and gave the most passionate plea for the passage of the Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution, Mr. Speaker, is a resolution in tribute to Mr. David Ray Ritcheson, after having lost his life in July of 2007. We look forward to the debate of this resolution on the floor of the House, and we pay tribute to David Ray Ritcheson for his courage and for the tragedy that took his life.</paragraph>
