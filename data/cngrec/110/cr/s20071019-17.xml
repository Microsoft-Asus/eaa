    <paragraph>Madam President, the current Presiding Officer joins a very elite group of freshman Members who have achieved the distinction of presiding in the Senate for over 100 hours.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>

    <paragraph>I am so happy to announce that Senator Klobuchar achieved this distinction today an hour and 5 minutes ago. I congratulate her. I am embarrassed to say that as a freshman, we had a large freshman class, but I didn't preside for this long. I thought I was here all the time. It is really quite a nice award. It is something one can keep forever. We have gone to some length to make sure it looks good. For the time that I presided over the Senate as a freshman, I really learned  a lot. One learns Senate procedures, different personalities of Senators who come to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Minnesota is to be commended. She takes good care of her State. She goes back often. She has a wonderful family. She does it all. She sets a great example for the rest of the people in America, but especially she has added so much to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first came here, the woman was MIKULSKI. The woman still is MIKULSKI, but she has a lot of people to help her now. The Senate is a much better place with more women. Someday--it won't be in the immediate future but not in the distant future--we will have a body that will have an equal number of women as men. When that happens, the Senate will be a better place. Congratulations.</paragraph>
