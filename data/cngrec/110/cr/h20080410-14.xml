  <narrative>NEW EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2168]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on November 1, the Nation's employment verification system, E-Verify, is going to expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>E-Verify is a broken employment verification system that has helped grow the number of illegal immigrants in America to over 12 million. We have got to find new solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill, <bill type="h" number="5515">H.R. 5515</bill>, the New Employment Verification Act or NEVA, would  replace the current paper-based and error-prone I-9 process upon which E-Verify is based with an electronic verification system. <bill type="h" number="5515">H.R. 5515</bill> would use the existing new hire registry reporting process already used by over 90 percent of U.S. employers. This bill will create a national employment verification system for new hires that's reliable and efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With E-Verify scheduled to expire this year, now is the time for the Congress to create a new way to move forward that prevents unauthorized employment. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="5515">H.R. 5515</bill>.</paragraph>
