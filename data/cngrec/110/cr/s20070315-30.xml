    <paragraph>Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to Maui Economic Opportunity, Inc. for 42 years of outstanding community service. A private, non-profit organization dedicated to helping individuals and families in need, MEO was chartered as a community action agency on March 22, 1965, by Federal mandate under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than four decades, MEO has served the people of Maui, Moloka'i and La 8na'i through a number of poverty fighting initiatives. By providing employment training and placement, business education for low income entrepreneurs, and micro-enterprise loans, MEO has helped countless citizens get back on the path to financial independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, MEO has helped citizens lead fuller, richer lives by providing housekeeping for seniors, allowing them to remain in their homes, and providing specialized transportation for seniors, persons with disabilities and children to doctor's offices, grocery stores, and schools. In addition, they have helped former inmates reintegrate and become productive members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hard work and dedication of Maui Economic Opportunity's staff and volunteers have earned national recognition by receiving the prestigious Excellence in Community Action award from the Community Action Partnership. To this I would like to  add my sincere appreciation for the tireless efforts of these men and women for their continued advocacy on behalf of those in need of a helping hand.</paragraph>
