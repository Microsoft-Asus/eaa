    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the next sound you hear will be the rumble of thousands of Mexican trucks streaming across our southern border. The U.S. Government has agreed to allow 100 Mexican trucking companies to send trucks on the highways and byways of America. Presently, Mexican trucks may only go 20 miles inside the U.S. border. The U.S. Government says they will inspect the trucks for safety and inspect the drivers as well. Yeah, right. There are already 6,000 trucks a day crossing in each direction  just between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico; and only a fraction of these are inspected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country has no way of inspecting each and every Mexican truck for safety, and there is no telling what could be in them, whether it is legitimate cargo, narcotics or contaminated food. Not to mention, Mexican trucks are not up to the standards of the U.S. trucking industry. Overweight, polluting Mexican trucks driven by low paid, unqualified drivers that may not even be able to read highway signs is a dangerous policy for the citizens of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, our government seems to be more concerned about Mexico than it is about our Nation, our highways or our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
