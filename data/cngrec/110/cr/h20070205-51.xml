<record where="h" when="1170694805" ordinal="51" title="HONORING SCIPIO A. JONES">
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Snyder) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400383" topic="">
    <paragraph>People throughout America, Madam Speaker, celebrate our heroes of the Civil Rights Movement. Every American knows of the great contributions of Martin Luther King. No Arkansan celebrates these heroes without celebrating the Little Rock Nine. No Arkansan remembers these heroes without remember Daisy Bates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently introduced a bill to remember another noteworthy Arkansan who is not as well known as he deserves to be, Scipio A. Jones. Scipio A. Jones contributed to moving Arkansas and our Nation forward, and I am pleased that earlier today the House adopted this measure, <bill type="h" number="433">H.R. 433</bill>, to designate the facility at 1700 Main Street in Little Rock as the Scipio A. Jones Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His is the life of which movies should be made, Madam Speaker. Scipio Africanus Jones was born a slave in Dallas County, Arkansas in 1863. He moved to Little Rock, Arkansas in the 1880s, took preparatory courses at Philander Smith College and graduated from North Little Rock's Bethel University, now Shorter College, with a Bachelor's Degree in 1887.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jones apprenticed to practicing attorneys and was accepted into the Arkansas Bar in 1889. He was admitted to the Supreme Court of Arkansas in 1900, to the U.S. District Court for the Western Division of the Eastern District of Arkansas and the U.S. Circuit Court for Arkansas in 1901, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905 and the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1914.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1915 and 1924, Jones was appointed as a special judge to preside over cases when the regular judge had been incapacitated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the National Attorney General for the Mosaic Templars of America, an international fraternal organization headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas which provided services to African Americans in an era when discrimination resulted in few basic services being readily available. The location of the Post Office we will designate is less than a mile away from the Mosaic Templars headquarters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a visit to Little Rock, Arkansas by Treasury Secretary W.G. McAdoo during World War I, Scipio A. Jones personally wrote a check to purchase $50,000 worth of Liberty bonds to support the Allied cause in World War I, and soon thereafter raised another $50,000 for this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was honored by President Woodrow Wilson, who appointed him to the National Advisory Board to the Liberty Bond effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He opposed and helped defeat grandfather clause legislation that some southerners were seeking to add to the Arkansas Constitution to disenfranchise and prevent African American voter participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of the Elaine Massacre of 1919, which resulted in the deaths of five Caucasians and an estimated 856 African Americans, Scipio A. Jones garnered national attention with the successful defense of 12 sharecroppers who had been condemned to death and by securing the release of nearly 100 other Elaine defendants who had been sent to prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legal work of Jones ultimately resulted in the case of Moore v. Dempsey being argued before the United States Supreme Court, which found that mob-dominated trials were a violation of the due process clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was widely respected by people of all races in the central Arkansas community. He died on March 28, 1943 and is buried at Haven of Rest Cemetery in Little Rock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this designation will acknowledge the lifelong service of Scipio A. Jones as a civic leader, talented lawyer, skillful jurist and civil rights leader and for his remarkable courage and notable contributions to the advancement of social justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Waxman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for bringing <bill type="h" number="433">H.R. 433</bill> to the floor, and Denise Wilson of that committee for assistance in moving it forward. I also thank Representative Lynch and Representative Shays for the kind words they offered during debate on the bill today, as well as James Savage, of my staff, for his work on this legislation.</paragraph>
