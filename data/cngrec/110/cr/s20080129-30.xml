    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, let me commend Senator Webb for the leadership on the issue he talked about. I am going to speak very briefly on that same issue--the signing of the statement by the President yesterday--but before I do that, I wish to commend him and the other sponsors of this legislation. It is critically needed. It is long overdue. But for the leadership of Senator Webb and a few other Senators, we would not have had that provision in the bill which was finally  signed yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the President did sign into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which is essentially the same bill the President vetoed last month. In his signing statement, the President identified a few provisions of the act and stated that they:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the President's ability to carry out his constitutional obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's statement went on to say that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The specific provisions the President cited relate to a commission to study  and submit reports to Congress on wartime contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He cited a provision that enhances the protections from reprisal for contractor employees who disclose evidence of waste, fraud or abuse on Department of Defense contracts. He objected--or at least raised a question--about a requirement for offices within the intelligence community to respond to written  requests from the chairman or ranking member of the Armed Services Committees for intelligence assessments, reports, estimates or legal opinions within 45 days, unless the President asserts a privilege pursuant to the Constitution of the United States; and he</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I understand the President's statement did not say these specific provisions or any other provisions of the act are unlawful, nor that the executive branch would not implement these provisions. I also understand similar statements have been included in signing statements on a number of laws by this President and that those statements did not result in the refusal to enforce the law as written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, I believe it is important to come to the floor as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee to express the view that Congress has a right to expect the administration will faithfully implement all the provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008--not just the ones the President happens to agree with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I noted at the outset, the President vetoed an earlier version of this act which contained the same specific provisions he singled out in his signing statement yesterday. The President did not choose to exercise his veto over those provisions and, as a result, they have not changed in any way whatsoever in the version of the bill the President chose to sign. With his signature, these provisions become the law of the land. Congress and the American people have a right to expect the administration  will now faithfully carry them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
