  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, energy independence and fighting global warming are essential, and they are the challenges of our day. Years of inaction, even disbelief on the part of the White House and the Republicans, have delayed any real work being done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week the Democratic Congress will bring a bill to the floor to change this. There will be an Energy and Water appropriations bill that will provide substantial funding to fight global warming. Overall, the bill appropriates $3 billion for researching the effects of global warming. This funding will allow us to monitor radiation in the atmosphere, to use state-of-the-art computer technology to conduct climate change modeling and to conduct long-term experiments on the impact of increased  carbon dioxide levels on forests and other ecosystems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This research will finally allow us to have the science that we need to fight this battle. We have delayed it for years because of the Republican administration's inactivity. I hope that this week the Republican leadership will join with the Democrats in Congress to finally move this forward.</paragraph>
