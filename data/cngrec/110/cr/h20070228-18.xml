    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thanks to a 4-month investigation by the Washington Post, the world learned last week that our Nation's injured soldiers are not receiving the care they deserve once they return from active duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Post investigation described conditions at Walter Reed Hospital that are deplorable. One of the buildings at the facility, Building 18, showed signs of neglect everywhere: mouse droppings, cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses and mold on the ceilings. After the Post printed its findings last week, the Pentagon finally started renovating Building 18, but it should not have taken the embarrassment of this investigation for the Pentagon to do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American soldiers who have put their lives on the line for this Nation deserve better than what they are getting at Building 18. The Pentagon says it was forced into housing hundreds of troops there after all the other buildings were filled to capacity, and now the President wants to send more troops to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is critical that this Congress ensure that the Pentagon meets the needs of our injured soldiers.</paragraph>
