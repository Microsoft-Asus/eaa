    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pass along some inside information to the American people. By the way, this is the most poorly kept secret in Congress. Big surprise: The Democrats want to raise taxes, again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never mind that tax revenues increased by 11.5 percent last year because of strong economic growth, economic growth created by the Bush tax cuts over the last 6 years. Never mind, never mind, the economy is strong. Never mind that last year the U.S. Government took in more revenue than any government in history. Actually, in the history of the planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But yet that is not enough revenue for the Democrats' plans, yet they talk about pay-as-you-go in order to tax the American people more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a poorly kept secret, that the tax and spend Democrats are indeed still tax and spend Democrats.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
