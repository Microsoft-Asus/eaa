  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, we, as Members of Congress, owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in a way that reinforces, rather than diminishes, the public's faith and confidence in Congress. An informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy. And, a democratic Government operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye. With this bill, we have an opportunity to balance the right of the public to know with its right to petition Government; the ability of  lobbyists to advocate their clients' causes with the need for truthful public discourse; and the ability of Members to legislate with the imperative that our Government must be free from corrupting influences, both real and perceived. We must act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the public's confidence in Congress does not become a collapse of confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased with the progress we have been making on this bill. We have been having a good debate on a range of proposals to further improve this bill, including requirements to reign in wasteful spending such as by more fully disclosing earmarks and granting the President's enhanced recision authority. We have recognized the need for increased disclosure and more timely reporting of lobbyists' activities. And, I am pleased that we are considering an amendment--one that I fully support--to require  Members of Congress who use corporate aircraft to reimburse the full charter rate for a flight, instead of simply paying the cost of a first-class ticket, as required under the current rules. These are all solid proposals, but we need to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, on this issue of the first-class airfare, I don't think there is a more dramatic example of the difference between we Members of Congress and the average American citizen. No American citizen can today call up a corporation and say: Please let me use your airplane, and, by the way, I am only going to pay first-class airfare. Nothing is more egregious. There are worse abuses that go on around here, but there is no more egregious an example than the ability of a Member of Congress,  who many times has oversight of the corporation that provides the aircraft, taking advantage of a situation where they only have to pay first-class airfare, with a difference of sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. It is remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to reform earmarking beyond mere disclosure requirements. We need to curtail this practice, which cost American taxpayers $64 billion in FY 2006, and I have offered an amendment to help do that. Above all, we need to ensure the enactment and enforcement of comprehensive lobbyist, ethics and earmark reforms. That is why we need to establish an Office of Public Integrity to help provide enforcement measures for the reforms that we are advocating. We can pass all the rules changes we want  but unless we back them up with a tough enforcement mechanism, they are useless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of earmarks, Madam President--and I obviously have a long record of being opposed to these egregious examples of porkbarreling--I think that it is important for us to recognize that there are two ways we can address earmarking. One is to eliminate them and the other is to watch them grow. Over the previous 20 years, I have watched them grow and grow and grow and grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was intrigued by getting a call from an administration official who said the President is for cutting them in half. That is like saying we want to cut half of the drug dealers in America. There is an addiction in Congress to porkbarreling, and we have to cure the addiction or it will continue to grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is because of this need that I am pleased to again join my colleagues, Senators Lieberman and Collins, in cosponsoring an amendment to create an Office of Public Intergrity to investigate complaints of ethical violations by Senators, staff, or officers of this Chamber. Headed by a Director appointed by the President pro tem of the Senate upon the joint recommendation of the majority and minority leaders, the Office of Public Integrity would investigate complaints of rules  violations filed with or initiated by the office. To ensure swift action, within 30 days of receiving a complaint, the office would be required to make an initial determination whether to dismiss or investigate it. Although a determination by the office to investigate may be overridden by the Select Committee on Ethics, the amendment stipulates that this can occur only if the Ethics Committee overrides the decision by a two-thirds vote and makes this vote public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To assist it in its investigation, the Office of Public Integrity would be empowered to issue subpoenas, take statements, and compel the attendance of witnesses. If, after investigation, the Director of the office determines that there is probable cause that a violation occurred, he or she must inform the Ethics Committee, which again, can decide not to proceed on a complaint, but only upon a two-thirds vote that must be made public. If the Ethics Committee does not overrule the office's determination  of probable cause, the office shall present the case to the Ethics Committee which shall vote on whether the subject of the investigation violated any rules or other standards. Again, this vote must be made public. If the Ethics Committee finds there was a violation, the Director of the Office of Public Integrity shall recommend appropriate sanctions and whether the matter should be referred to the Department of Justice for investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 2 years, the Committee on Indian Affairs which I chaired at the time, investigated the actions of Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon, and  brought to light their efforts to manipulate the political process. If there is a silver lining to the Abramoff affair, it is that it helped to compel Congress to reassess the rules that govern our dealings with lobbyists and others who seek to influence us, and to do so through the eyes of the public, not through  our own jaundiced perspectives. Frankly, I also believe the American public sent a clear message that business as usual in an unacceptable proposition. That is what drives our amendment today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I point out that we investigated in the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Mr. Abramoff and his connection, frankly, with both sides of the Capitol. There was never an Ethics Committee investigation. It was the Justice Department that finally had to take action. There was ample evidence of misbehavior in violation of the rules of both Houses, and here we are with people in jail and, as far as I know, the Ethics Committee never ruled on their behavior. So when I hear people say the Office  of Public Integrity would somehow cause us embarrassment, are we not embarrassed by what already happened? Are we not embarrassed that Members of Congress violated their oath of office to the degree that they are in jail and the investigation continued on the part of the Justice Department?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the opponents of this amendment, in a perfect world, maybe you are right. In the world that we live in today, you are not right. We owe the American public a better system than the one that has been in place for the past several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While strengthening the Senate rules regarding disclosure, gifts, meals, travel and post-employment lobbying is necessary and overdue, it is also of little importance if the rules are not enforced. Instances of apparent violations of congressional rules by Members and staff who were the beneficiaries of Mr. Abramoff's largesse were widely reported. Press accounts of luxury trips, high-priced tickets to sporting events, meals at expensive restaurants, and other gifts suggest that there had been  flagrant, if not widespread, violations of our rules, and that these violations had been occurring for some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the columnist and scholar Norman Ornstein has observed, Congress has "regularly struggled with its constitutional responsibility to police itself, sometimes verging on partisan vendettas--what we called in the 1980s and 1990s `the criminalization of partisan differences'--but more often erring on the side of doing nothing, or as little as humanly possible, to deal with ethical violations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when the public is demanding change, the Senate needs to more aggressively enforce its own rules. We should do this not just by making more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee currently undertakes, but by addressing the conflict that is inherent in any body that regulates itself. By creating, as this amendment would do, a new office with the capacity to conduct and initiate investigations, and a perspective uncolored by partisan concerns or collegial relationships, I believe  we can address this long-standing structural problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment strikes a good balance by keeping with the Select Committee on Ethics the final decisions on whether to conduct an investigation, whether a violation has occurred, and whether to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, while adding an independent voice to the process to ensure that the reputation of the institution is not sacrificed for the understandable concern for the reputation of one's friends and colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Public Integrity would not only assist in performing existing investigative functions, but would also be charged with the new function of approving or denying requests for travel by Members and staff. The purpose of this pre-clearance is to ensure that the trips serve a legitimate Governmental interest, and are not substantially recreational in nature. I believe that the Office of Public Integrity would be an appropriate entity to conduct these reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the majority and minority leaders to allow an up or down vote on this amendment. The American public is watching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by Senator Lieberman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, there are many organizations that are observing our activities. I think, as I said earlier, we can be pleased at some of the progress we are making. But this would be a seminal vote. This will be an indication that we are really serious, if we are really serious, about making sure that decisions made by the Ethics Committee are untainted by personal relationships or by other factors. I think it is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out again that in the exit polling from the 2006 election there were two major issues that affected the voters' opinion and vote. One, as we all know, was the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other was the issue of "corruption in Washington."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public are very dissatisfied with the way Congress conducts its business. I have seen polls in the low twenties and even in the high teens of their approval rating of Congress. They don't think we conduct our business in an honest and straightforward manner, and they believe the special interests have way too much influence in determining both our priorities and the outcome of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the Lieberman amendment can go a long way toward restoring the very badly tarnished image of the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to take a few minutes to urge my Senate colleagues to carefully study and support my amendment to ban spouses of sitting Members of the Senate from lobbying any Member of the Senate or any Senate staff person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very important debate. It goes to the heart of rebuilding confidence of the American people in our institutions--Senate, House, all of Congress, all of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, we have seen scandal after scandal over several years, certainly involving both parties, that has, for obvious and good reason, rocked people's confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the heart of almost all of these scandals is a very simple, basic issue and that is public officials using their public position to enrich themselves, to enrich their family, and, of course, the public interest being sold down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is at the heart of this debate, and that concern is at the heart of my amendment. Again, my amendment--we will vote on this later this week--says very simply: No spouse of a sitting Member of the Senate can lobby the Senate, can lobby that Senator, can lobby that Senator's office, can lobby any Senator, can lobby any Senate office, can lobby any Senate committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I don't think this is a peripheral issue. I think it goes to the heart of the matter: People using public office to enrich themselves, to enrich their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the same reason, I thought it was important that we prohibit family members from going on the campaign payroll. Unfortunately, that was voted down. I think this is even more in need of strong action because certainly lobbying connections were at the heart of so many of the scandals that got us to this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two big problems, two big conflicts we are talking about that this amendment can largely solve. One is for certain lobbyists to have undue influence. That is clearly an issue with regard to lobbying of spouses of sitting Members of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill would prohibit those spouses from lobbying their spouse Member, that office. That is fine. But clearly, any Senate spouse is going to have an enormous advantage in terms of access and influence to other Senators and other Senate offices. Imagine if a spouse lobbyist walks in the door and his or her spouse happens to be the chair of a committee on which the Member she is lobbying sits. That is a pretty significant power relationship right in the midst of that lobbying. Clearly,  there is that real danger of undue influence and access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a second problem too. In my opinion, the second problem is even  bigger than the first, and that is for a special interest, for a monied interest, to have a mechanism to write a big check straight into the family bank account of a sitting Senator, to directly and dramatically increase the income, the personal wealth of a sitting Senator. That absolutely happens whenever you are going to allow spouses of sitting Senators to lobby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, that I think is an even bigger issue and certainly has been front and center in terms of a number of problems and scandals that have come up and reported fully in the media in the last couple of years on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that this recent article about the problem, about that very issue in the Washington Post be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is my understanding, initially, the Senator's amendment had a grandfather clause. Does it now contain that grandfather clause?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>No, it does not. I appreciate the question. In developing this amendment, we dealt with a lot of different ideas and a lot of different versions. I mistakenly filed a version with the grandfather clause in it. That was never my intent, in terms of filing an amendment in this Congress and in this debate. As soon as I learned that from my staff, I amended the amendment, and so it does not contain that grandfather clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thinking is very simple. If it is wrong, it is wrong. If it is a conflict, it is a conflict. If it is a problem, it is a problem. And because somebody has been doing it for a few years doesn't right the wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have an exception, which is different from a grandfather clause. I bent over backward to try to meet every reasonable argument. The exception says: If the spouse lobbyist was a lobbyist a year or more before the marriage or a year or more before the Member's first election to Congress, that is a bit of a different situation that is allowed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can make an argument for even doing away with that exception, but I tried to bend over backward for what I considered any legitimate argument.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, may I ask a second question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>So anyone who doesn't meet the specific confines of the Senator's bill would be forced to lose their job; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>No, it is not correct, for the following reason: My amendment, first of all, applies only to Senate spouses lobbying the Senate. It doesn't apply to the House, it doesn't apply to Federal agencies, it doesn't apply to State legislatures. It doesn't apply to all sorts of other things. To be quite honest and direct, I would like to have it apply more broadly to all of Congress, but to make my amendment germane, I have to forgo that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is a direct answer to the Senator's question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. SALAZAR addressed the Chair.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I believe I have the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to emphasize what I stated to the distinguished Senator from California. I tried to meet every legitimate argument. I bent over backward with regard to that issue. Specifically, I point out that the exception in my amendment that says, quite simply, if the spouse lobbyist was a lobbyist a year or more prior to the marriage or a year or more prior to the Member's first election to the House or Senate, then that is an exception, and they can continue lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every other case is a real problem, a real conflict, and specifically I don't think a grandfather clause that protects folks who are doing it now is appropriate. If it is wrong, it is wrong. If it is a conflict, it is a conflict. If it poses real ethical questions--that is true whether one has been doing it for 10 years or whether one starts tomorrow--I urge all the Senate to reject that grandfather clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message of a grandfather clause is simple: Yes, we are going to get serious about ethics, as long as it doesn't do anything in practice, as long as it doesn't affect our friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think that is the right policy. I don't think that is the right message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to support this amendment. The American people are watching this debate. They have seen the leadup to this debate. They have seen the scandals. They have seen the rhetoric in the campaigns, and they are wondering: Is this going to be real or is this going to be a farce?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had some votes, quite frankly, that are leading folks to believe this is a lot of show, a lot of sound and fury with nothing behind it. I hope we can prove those cynics wrong, but I have to admit, I am quickly becoming one of those cynics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this vote is going to say a lot about how serious we are. If there is a vote on the grandfather clause issue, that is going to say a lot about whether we are going to act when it has a consequence in this body or just act when it doesn't affect anybody in this body as it stands now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I urge all my colleagues to look at the amendment, support the amendment, certainly resist any grandfather clause which would be horrible policy, and send a very simple message to the American people. I look forward to a fuller debate on the issue and a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Colorado.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of amendment No. 71, which was offered and cosponsored by myself and Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska. The essence of the amendment we offered last night is to try to make sure that as we move forward with ethics reform in Washington, DC, a spotlight not just be on the Senate or the House of Representatives but that the ethics standards we are moving forward with in this legislation, which will be a hallmark piece of legislation  for Washington and for our Nation's Government, that those same kinds of high ethical standards should also apply to the senior executive officials of the executive branch of Government, as well as to the judicial branch of Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The essence of our amendment is to say, as we clean up Washington, DC, that we ought not to stop simply by cleaning up the affairs of the Congress; that what we ought to do is adopt a set of ethical standards that will also apply to the executive branch and to the judicial branch of Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward with that principle, what we have tried to do in this amendment is very simple. Let me discuss three important aspects of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our amendment would apply to the gift and travel ban--which will become the rules of this Senate on passage of this bill--to senior and very senior executive and judicial branch personnel. After passage of this bill, we in the legislative branch will operate under a stringent set of rules which will ban gifts and travel from lobbyists, among other things. Currently, executive branch personnel can, with few exceptions, accept gifts, except from a few so-called prohibited sources. Simply  put, there is no reason why lobbyists should be able to give gifts--no matter how small--to senior employees of the executive and judicial branches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the amendment would ban all executive branch personnel from lobbying their former agency for 1 year after leaving Government service. Currently, the revolving door rules in the executive branch apply only to senior and very senior personnel. That means junior employees of any executive branch agency are permitted to go directly from a Government job to a position of lobbying their former office. That, in my view, is an unethical thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, here in the Senate, all Members and staff are subject to at least some form of a revolving-door rule, and the bill we are debating would strengthen those rules for the Senators as well as for staff. Simply put, there is no reason the executive branch personnel, no matter how junior, should be permitted to lobby their former office immediately upon leaving Government service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the amendment would require senior and very senior executive branch personnel to disclose to the Office of Government Ethics any negotiation for private employment within 3 business days. The bill we are now debating would require Senators and senior Senate staff to disclose to the Ethics Committee that they are negotiating for private employment within 3 business days. There is no principled reason this rule should not apply equally to senior executive branch employees as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a narrowly drafted attempt to apply some of the key provisions of this bill to other branches of Government. It is based on both principle and practical concerns. The principle is that ethics rules should apply uniformly across the Government of the United States. The practical concern is that key Government personnel should not accept any gifts from parties seeking action by the Government, that all legislative and executive employees should adhere to minimum revolving-door standards,  that senior officials should not negotiate for future employment in secret, and that negotiations should be fully disclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support Senator Nelson's amendment, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to accept this amendment as we move forward in an effort to try to clean up Washington, DC. At the end of the day, this is much more than just about dealing with the ethics issues of the Senate and the House of Representatives; this should be an effort from all of us to send a loud and clear signal to the people of America that we are taking ethics seriously and that we are going to bring a new standard of conduct,  a new standard of ethics across all the branches of our Nation's Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to ask a couple of questions about the Vitter-Inhofe amendment, amendment No. 3. I think it is one thing if the amendment is prospective and doesn't affect people. I think it is another thing when it is retroactive. I believe our side would accept  the amendment if it were, in fact, prospective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment has a complicating factor in addition to that; that is, there is a prohibition against any official contact with any spouse of a Member who is a registered lobbyist under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. That is not any lobbying contact, it is official contact. Now, what is official contact? Does this mean the spouse, if he or she happens to have been a lobbyist for a substantial period of time, cannot attend the Supreme Court dinner which just took place? That could be interpreted  as an official contact. Is it an official contact if the individual calls the scheduler of her husband's or his wife's office and asks for some information on the schedule? I am surprised--and I didn't know this--that this amendment has the words "official contact." You can be sure that even if it said: Well, it is not an official contact, that someone will make the argument: Oh yes, it is an official contact if you attend the Supreme Court dinner with your spouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would repeat, this is retroactive legislation. We know it affects people in this body who have worked, helped support their families. I don't recall another time when we have enacted this kind of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it concerns me, and it concerns me if it is overly repressive, such as using the words "official contact." I am puzzled as to why, when the majority leader offered that if it had a grandfather clause, we would accept it, it wasn't taken, unless the intent is essentially to sever people from their ability to have anything to do with this body, whether it is simply as a spouse or as a professional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have some concerns about this amendment, and I wanted to take this opportunity to express them, and hopefully the author will respond.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>I certainly will.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished Senator from California for those points and questions. Let me respond to each one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I think what you said, literally at the very beginning of your comments, says it all. You said this would be fine if it didn't affect anyone, but it does. This would be window dressing if it didn't affect anyone, if it did not do anything. But, yes, it does. And it should.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield, please?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be happy to, after I finish my comment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Because I said "presently employed," if I may, through the Chair. To clarify that, I said anybody "presently employed." We know it affects people. We know it would affect people in the future. We also know it affects people presently employed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, the point is, yes, it is a great vote as long as it doesn't affect anyone here, as long as it doesn't affect anyone in the body now, as long as it doesn't affect any spouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I disagree. If it is a conflict, it is a conflict. If it is a problem, it is a problem. Having done it in the past doesn't cure the conflict, doesn't cure the problem. I think demanding that a grandfather clause be attached to this is the height of cynicism. We are going to reform things as long as it doesn't affect us. I think that is bad policy and I certainly think it is a very negative message to send to the American people--although it may be a rather clear message about what this debate  and exercise is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of the question about official contact, I think that is very clear because it is in the context of the lobbyist disclosure law. It is in the context of lobbyist contact. However, if the Senator continues to believe it is not clear and wants to offer any clarifying language, I would look at that and work with the Senator. I will be happy to work on clarifying language. Obviously, no one wants to prohibit spouses from going to the Supreme Court dinner or anything else. I think that is  a relatively--I don't think it is a problem. But even if you think it is one, I believe it is an easy problem to solve.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield for a moment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Through the Chair, on line 5, if you substituted "lobbying" for "official," I think that would do it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be happy to look at that and respond to that suggestion. Certainly, if there is any ambiguity there, and I don't think there is, I will be eager to clarify it and work on it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Again, I think this goes to the heart of the matter. I think this grandfather clause issue goes to the heart of the matter. Are we going to do something that "doesn't affect anybody," that doesn't matter in terms of people here and now and make a big show of it or are we going to make a difference and stop practices that the huge majority of the American people think are a real problem?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we are going to do the latter. I hope we are going to be real and substantive and not go through a PR exercise, and I think the American people are watching to find out. I think this, among other votes, will be a clarifying moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for her questions and I look forward to continuing the discussion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, if I may, I thank the Senator. Perhaps our staffs can get together directly and take a look at this. I appreciate it.</paragraph>
