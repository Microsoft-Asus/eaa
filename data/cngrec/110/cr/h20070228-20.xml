    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Employee Free Choice Act. Too many workers are being harassed by their employers because they want to form a union. We must put an end to scare tactics. This bill restores the right of workers to bargain for a better life. It will help 6 million workers join for better wages, benefits, working conditions and improving the quality of life. No more employer harassment. Simple and fair. The card-based system is pressure free. When workers choose,  bargaining results are more peaceful, worker-friendly. Please vote for this important legislation.</paragraph>
