  <narrative>By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Ms. SNOWE, Mr. KERRY, and Mr. MARTINEZ:)</narrative>
  <narrative><bill type="s" number="2998">S. 2998</bill>. A bill to require accurate and reasonable disclosure of the terms and conditions of prepaid telephone calling cards and services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, prepaid telephone calling cards  are used by many Americans to stay in touch with loved ones around the country and throughout the world. Unfortunately, some providers and distributors of these cards are scamming consumers--by imposing undisclosed junk fees, charging exorbitant rates, and selling cards that expire shortly after consumers start using them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past couple of years, a number of State Attorneys General and the Federal Trade Commission have opened investigations and found that a number of providers and distributors are engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices. These practices include charging customers for calls where they receive busy signals, imposing weekly "maintenance fees" that may take away up to 20 percent of the card's overall value, and billing for calls in 3-minute increments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of these investigations, some companies have been fined or have entered into consent decrees forbidding them from engaging in some deceptive practices. In addition, some states--including Florida--have imposed certain regulatory requirements on prepaid calling card providers and distributors. To date, however, neither the Federal Communications Commission nor the Federal Trade Commission has taken any action to impose up-front nationwide consumer protection requirements on this industry.  This lack of Federal standards allows many of these unscrupulous operators to move from State to State, and create new "shell companies" to escape consumer protection regulations. This is wrong, and I think we need to fix this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I rise today to introduce the Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act of 2008 requires the Federal Trade Commission to draft comprehensive rules requiring all prepaid telephone calling card providers and distributors to disclose the rates and fees associated with their calling cards upfront, at the point of sale. It also requires providers who market their cards in languages other than English to disclose rates and fees in that language as well. Furthermore, the legislation requires providers to honor the cards for  at least a year after the time the card is first used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To enforce these disclosure requirements, the bill gives the Federal Trade Commission, State Attorneys General, and State consumer protection advocates the ability to sue the fraudsters who violate these requirements in Federal court. In addition, the law expressly preserves additional state consumer protection requirements--such as state utility commission certification or bonding requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite my colleagues to join with Senators SNOWE, KERRY, MARTINEZ and myself in supporting the Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act of 2008. We should waste no time in ensuring that military servicemembers, seniors, immigrants and other Americans using these prepaid telephone calling cards are protected from bad actors in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative><bill type="s" number="3000">S. 3000</bill>. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to include Federally recognized tribal organizations in certain grant programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs for the several States and territories, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I proudly introduce, along with my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Daniel Inouye, the Native American Veterans Access Act. This measure would provide equitable veterans' services to Native Americans by allowing tribal governments to apply for veterans' program grants currently limited to States, and in some cases, even U.S. Territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native veterans have a long history of honorable and extraordinary service in our national defense. From the American Indians who served alongside General George Washington, to Nainoa Hoe, a Native Hawaiian soldier who was killed on patrol in Iraq while carrying the battle flag his father held in Vietnam, native veterans have served bravely and honorably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, too often our Nation's track record in serving native veterans does not match their service. Especially in the case of native veterans who return to their ancestral homelands, reservation communities, or tribal villages, many native veterans are geographically and culturally disconnected from the services provided by State and Federal veterans' programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the problem is that veterans' programs are not always designed with native veterans in mind. For example, while the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor operate several exemplary veterans' grant programs for State governments, most of these programs are not open to tribal governments. The bill I am introducing today would address this issue, by giving tribal governments access to many of these important programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, my bill would provide access to VA's two nursing home grants, which help local governments construct veterans' nursing homes and pay for nursing home care, adult day care, domiciliary care, and hospital care. It is important that tribal governments be included in these grants, given the expected rise in the number of older native veterans. The U.S. Census projects that while the overall number of older veterans will decrease by 10 percent by 2020, during that same period the number of  older native veterans will increase by 60 percent. This expected boom in older native veterans makes it important that we give tribal governments the same opportunities we already provide State governments to care for their elder veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill would also give the Secretary of Labor discretion to include tribal governments in Veterans Employment and Training programs and grants. Veterans' employment services are much needed among native veterans, and in Indian Country. Census data indicates that American Indian and Alaska Native veterans are twice as likely as other veterans to be unemployed. For those veterans living on-reservation, the labor market is shamefully dismal: a recently published report from the Bureau of Indian  Affairs found on-reservation unemployment to be 49 percent. That unemployment rate is twice as high as national unemployment was during the worst year of the Great Depression. Surely it is not too much to ask that tribal governments in these circumstances be considered for the veterans' employment programs States and U.S. Territories already have access to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these measures, as we work towards parity in access and benefits for Native American veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the the Record.</paragraph>
