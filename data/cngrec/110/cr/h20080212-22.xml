    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to join my colleagues today in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3468">H.R. 3468</bill>, which seeks to name a postal facility on the campus of Elizabeth City State University in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, after a great American, Dr. Clifford Bell Jones, Sr. Mr. Speaker, this bill has the support of the entire North Carolina delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Clifford Bell Jones, Sr., was born in Washington County, North Carolina, a very rural part of my congressional district. He and his family relocated to Virginia, and Dr. Jones spent his formative years in Hampton. Later he attended Lutheran College in Greensboro, North Carolina. In 1923, Dr. Jones received a Bachelor of Science degree from the great Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Dr. Jones earned a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree in 1927 from the historic Meharry Medical  College in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly after being awarded his dental degree, Dr. Jones began his professional life in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where he practiced general dentistry for 66 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud to sponsor this legislation because my father and Dr. Jones were very close friends. They were classmates at Shaw. They were classmates at Meharry, and they fought together in World War I and spent their lifetimes in service to their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones participated in many local and community activities in Elizabeth City. He was one of the first African Americans to run for the city council in Elizabeth City in 1957 and was defeated by only 28 votes. Later, in the 1960s, Dr. Jones was appointed to serve on the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County School Board. He served as a deacon at the Cornerstone Missionary Baptist Church in Elizabeth City, and as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of the Albemarle. He was a proud trustee  emeritus of Elizabeth City State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said a moment ago, a veteran of World War I, he was a member of American Legion Post 223.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones was a member, as was my father, of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, and was a 32-degree Mason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones was a member of numerous professional organizations that included the Eastern North Carolina Medical, Dental and Pharmaceutical Society, and the North Carolina Dental Society, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones was the recipient of several awards and honors throughout his professional career. He received the Meharry Medical College President's Award for Service to Mankind. I accompanied Dr. Jones and my father back to Meharry for their 50th reunion in 1977. It was a great occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twice Dr. Jones was awarded the Delta Iota Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity's Certificate of Honor, and I'm sure the Speaker would take great pride in that, as the Speaker of the House today, the acting Speaker, is an Omega, for exceptional service to the citizens of northeastern North Carolina in the field of dentistry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was awarded a certificate of appreciation from the City Council of Elizabeth City for his invaluable services on the city's human relations committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones dedicated the better part of his 99 years serving mankind in his profession and through his community and involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Dr. Clifford Bell Jones, Sr., passed away several years ago and leaves a rich history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Jones for his outstanding service to my home State of North Carolina and to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "aye" on <bill type="h" number="3468">H.R. 3468</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the passing of this bill designating the post office in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, as the Dr. Clifford Bell Jones, Sr. Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones led an honorable life serving his country, profession, and community with dignity for well over half a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A veteran of World War I, Dr. Jones returned home to earn his bachelor of science from Shaw University and ultimately his doctorate of dental surgery from Meharry Medical College Dental School in 1927. He began his professional career in Elizabeth City, North  Carolina, and found himself at home. He practiced general dentistry there for 66 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside of the office, he remained extremely active in his community. With the encouragement of other council members, including the father of Mr. Butterfield, Dr. Jones ran for city council in 1957. He was defeated by just 28 votes. Though he did not win the seat, he was one of the first African Americans to run for city council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1960s, Dr. Jones served on the Elizabeth City-Pasquotank County School Board and as deacon at his church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, Dr. Jones' contributions were recognized by those whom he touched. Among his many honors he received the Meharry Medical College President's Award for Service to Mankind and a special recognition award for loyalty and service to the dental profession from the Old North State Dental Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though not a native, Elizabeth City lost one of their own when Dr. Jones passed away in 1995 at the age of 99.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm happy to rise today in support of this legislation honoring a dedicated professional, a wonderful human being, and a symbol of this community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
