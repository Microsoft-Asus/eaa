  <narrative>REMEMBERING ROBERT COOK EDWARDS -- (Senate - December 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10944">S10944</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a dedicated educator and innovator, Clemson University president emeritus Robert Cook Edwards. After a lifetime of unprecedented service to his students as Clemson's longest serving chief executive, Dr. Edwards passed away in Seneca, SC, on December 4, 2008, at the age of 94.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Edwards will be remembered for his legendary leadership, strength in business negotiation, and passion for Clemson football. Known as a giant in the history of Clemson University and affectionately referred to as "R.C." by his students, he led the institution through a period of peaceful integration and phenomenal growth to become a thriving, coeducational, and diversified university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in Fountain Inn, SC, Dr. Edwards attended Clemson College at the young age of 15. He went on to graduate with a bachelor of science degree in textile engineering in 1933, and after a successful career in the textile industry, he returned to Clemson as the university's first vice president for development in 1956. Dr. Edwards became acting president in 1958, after the death of President Robert F. Poole, and was eventually elected president on April 9, 1959, by the board of trustees.  He became the eighth chief executive of Clemson and the second alumnus to hold the position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Edwards peacefully led the university through racial integration when its first African-American student was enrolled in 1962. Despite the recurring turmoil of racial tensions during the 1960s, President Edwards handled those challenging times without incident. His brave actions resulted in progress and advancement of equal civil rights throughout the State of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time of his retirement in 1979, Dr. Edwards had awarded over 28,000 diplomas, which represented more than 70 percent of all the undergraduate degrees and doctorates awarded in Clemson's history to date, the student body had grown to 11,000 students, 4 schools had become 9 colleges, and the students could choose from over 60 majors. Because of Dr. Edwards's oversight, leadership, and enthusiasm for growth, his influence has stretched beyond the gates of the university to impact the lives  of men and women all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Edwards was predeceased by his wife Louise Odom Edwards, who died on July 29, 2008. She was affectionately referred to as "Moon Pie" by Clemson students and alumni and was said to be a perfect compliment to her husband, "R.C."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert Cook Edwards's legacy will live on not only in the hearts of his students and fellow educators, but through the developments and achievements he has accomplished at one of our Nation's finest institutions. I ask that the Senate join me in commemorating Dr. Edwards's lifelong dedication to higher learning and to the State of South Carolina.</paragraph>
