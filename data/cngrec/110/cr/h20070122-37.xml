  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, anniversaries are commonly recognized as a cause for celebration. Yet today the 34th anniversary of Roe v. Wade is no cause for celebration. While I am inspired by the thousands of citizens who came to Washington to march for life, I am truly disheartened by those who celebrate this "anniversary," a date which marks an overactive judiciary allowing the destruction of human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This judicial opinion's 34th anniversary marks the Federal judiciary's usurpation of the Republic's right to set social and moral policy through the electoral process. Moreover, the science behind the opinion is outdated and should, at the very least, be reevaluated in light of new advancements in science over the last 34 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many legal scholars see the finding in Roe v. Wade as nothing more than judicial activism, a poorly written opinion lacking logic and the strict interpretation of the Constitution in rendering said opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real legacy of Roe v. Wade is a culture war that will likely continue through many of the opinion's anniversaries yet to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is no cause for celebration. It is yet another example of judges legislating from the bench. Human life is a gift from God, and we all should cherish and protect it.</paragraph>
