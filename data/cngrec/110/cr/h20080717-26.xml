    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, good morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, several of my Republican colleagues are coming to Golden, Colorado, which is my home, to visit the National Renewable Energy Lab, and I want to welcome them, and I want to thank them for coming out to take a look at that laboratory. It's the finest laboratory in the world to come up with energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this day and age with gas at $4 a gallon, we have to look forward. We cannot remain hooked and addicted to oil and dependent on the Middle East. And so by them coming out to Colorado--they've never really favored renewable energy and energy efficiency--but it's time that we stop this addiction that we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we all know, and I'm beginning to hear my friends on the Republican side of the aisle recognize the need for renewable energy and energy efficiency because it's good for national security, it's good for the climate, and it is good for jobs; and I welcome them to my home in Golden, Colorado, and I look forward to them looking and visiting the National Renewable Energy Lab.</paragraph>
