  <narrative>FEINGOLD AMENDMENTS -- (Senate - February 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1149">S1149</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this afternoon we will indulge in a little bit of nostalgia with another vote on the Feingold bill to cut off funds for our troops in Iraq. I don't know what our friends on the other side expect to accomplish, but if past experience is any guide, we already know the outcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last May, 67 of us voted against the proposal to cut off funds for our troops in the field. Mr. President, 4 months later, 70 Senator s--3 more--voted against it the second time. Two weeks after that, 68 Senators voted against it for a third time. And in December, 71 of us--more than three-fourths of the Senate--voted no once again to cutting off funds for troops in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the outcome of the final vote on the Feingold bill is obvious: The Senate is on record not once but four times  that it will not cut off funds while our troops are in the  field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the more so will we oppose it when the fight in Iraq, by all accounts, is showing clear-cut tactical progress, and now, at last, some important political progress is also apparent over in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does give us an opportunity--an opportunity to step back and highlight the remarkable progress that has been made in Iraq since the first time our friends proposed cutting off funds last May. It gives us a chance to highlight</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two months ahead of another visit by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, we should acknowledge the heroic sacrifices of our men and women in uniform and the important turnaround they have achieved in Iraq on behalf of the American people. The brave Iraqis who have stood with them also deserve our praise. All of this is in our Nation's long-term security interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ACTIN G PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will make a statement prior to the Iraq votes, and I will be happy to lay out why we are doing this. We are doing this because the majority of the American people recognize this war in Iraq is costing huge amounts of money. Some are saying now as much as $15 billion a month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's say it is not that much. Let's say it is only the lower figure of $10 billion to $12 billion a month. I met</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are going to continue to debate this because the American people know what is taking place, and I will discuss this more fully right before the votes on the two cloture motions that have been filed on  the Iraq situation.</paragraph>
