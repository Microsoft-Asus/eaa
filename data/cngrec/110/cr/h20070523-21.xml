  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for too long our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil. Today all of our constituents and all Americans are feeling that lack of independence at the pump. It is time for this Congress to enact realistic and effective energy legislation that will help America become energy independent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must begin to invest in the resources we have right here at home. We must work together to create solutions to rely on our own ingenuity rather than the unreliable sources of foreign energy. Some of these solutions begin right on the farm, like in my own district in northeast Wisconsin. Biodiesel, methane digesters, cellulosic ethanol, all of these measures will help us become independent once again. It begins with a $5 million investment in our own family farms, the energy independent family  farm program. This provision will be included in the farm bill, and I urge all my colleagues to support it, along with the other positive measures within it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By investing and creating energy independence on the farm, we will take the first step in becoming less dependent on foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
