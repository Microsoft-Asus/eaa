    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise tonight on a sad occasion in the loss of loved ones in the Kirkwood, Missouri, community, part of which I represent and part of which is represented by my colleague Representative Akin of St. Louis County, and tonight we want to talk about that incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This close-knit community of Kirkwood, Missouri, struggles this week over the loss of loved ones. The wounded, especially Mayor Mike Swoboda, who remains hospitalized, and the chill to public servants and citizens from the violence in Kirkwood City Hall at the level of democratic government closest to the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw firsthand last Friday night at the Kirkwood community's candlelight vigil the way this community has come together through this tragedy, uplifted by ordinary people performing extraordinary acts of heroism, caring, and love. The hearts and prayers of all Missouri and the Nation go out to the families now grieving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our obligation is to care for the wounded and honor the lost, who were lost while on duty in the high calling of public service. We lost two city council members, Councilwoman Connie Karr and Councilman Michael Lynch; two police officers, Officer Tom Ballman and Officer William Biggs; and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We search our hearts and minds to understand what went wrong that terrible day this past week, to honor their public service, and to learn from this breakdown in the public square. Rightly, we come together to let them know they are not alone in their suffering. We know each and every one of them found purpose in life helping others and as public servants in the public good. One person, Dick Reeves, posted a comment on the St. Louis Post Dispatch site that impressed me and it summed up how to  deal with this tragedy. He said, "If something positive comes out of this horrific tragedy, please let it be that in the memory of these good people, each and every one of us dedicates ourselves to treating our elected officials and each other at home, work, school, play, and while driving with respect, decency, and kindness. We can do it. Let our actions be their monument."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would like to yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Akin).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great tragedy that occurred in Kirkwood, Missouri, in my  district this last Thursday. On what seemed to be a typical night in what has long been considered an almost idyllic community, Charles Lee Thornton shot and killed Police Sergeant William Biggs outside of the Kirkwood City Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After entering City Hall, Mr. Thornton then shot and killed four dedicated civil servants and severely wounded the mayor before he himself was shot and killed by responding Kirkwood police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Kirkwood Mayor Mike Swoboda continues to struggle for his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those killed in the City Hall were Police Officer Tom Ballman, Councilwoman Connie Karr, Councilman Mike Lynch, and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost. Kenneth Yost had served in that position for 35 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Kirkwood and surrounding communities lay to rest officers and public servants, one cannot help but be moved by the deep sense of faith expressed by the family and friends they have left behind. What has also become so clear is the deep commitment that these individuals had for their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that service in mind, I would like to refer to Matthew 20:28, which states: "Among you, whoever wants to be great must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the willing servant of all, like the Son of Man; He did not come to be served but to serve and to give up his life as a ransom for many."</paragraph>
