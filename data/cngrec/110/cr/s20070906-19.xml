    <paragraph>Madam President, I take great pride now in asking unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess for 2 minutes so we may greet five Parliamentarians from the Republic of Slovenia. I take great pride in this. As the occupant of the Chair knows, my mother came from the small village of Suha in Slovenia, was an immigrant to this country. I know the grandfather of the Senator from Minnesota also came from Slovenia. So for those of us with Slovenian roots, this is a proud moment. In  its 16 years of independence, Slovenia has established a stable multiparty democracy, a free press, an independent judiciary, and an excellent human rights record. In 2004, Slovenia joined NATO and became a member of the European Union. In fact, in January of 2008, Slovenia will ascend to the presidency of the European Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are proud to have five members of the Slovenian Parliament here: Miro Petek, Marijan Pojbic, Jozef Horvat, Samo Bevk, and Marjan Drofenik.</paragraph>
