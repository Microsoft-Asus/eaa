    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour. The time is divided between the two sides. The Republicans will control the first portion. The Senate is expected to resume consideration of the Defense authorization bill this morning. Today the Senate will recess under a previous order entered for our respective party conferences at 12:30 and reconvene at 2:15. At some point during today's session it is expected that we will receive a message from  the House relating to the SCHIP program, children's health. The Senate will consider that message and take the necessary steps to conclude action and send it to the President.</paragraph>
