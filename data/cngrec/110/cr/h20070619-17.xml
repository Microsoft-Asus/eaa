    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, nearly 2 months after the horrifying events at Virginia Tech took the lives of 32 innocent people, I am grateful the House last week acted to improve State reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Sadly, had this legislation been in place sooner, that tragic day at Virginia Tech might never have occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm especially pleased that the National Rifle Association, of which I'm a proud member, was active in supporting this effort. I'm also thankful John Goodwin, previously with former Congressman Rob Simmons, has recently joined their able team. The NRA plays a vital role in promoting second amendment rights, and I appreciate their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families affected by the Virginia Tech shootings. I urge the Senate to quickly consider <bill type="h" number="2640">H.R. 2640</bill> to ensure guns are available to law-abiding citizens and kept from the hands of criminals</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11. Our sympathy to the people of Charleston due to the tragic deaths of courageous firemen.</paragraph>
