  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a remarkable professor, scholar, and author, Dr. Emmett Buell of Denison University in Granville, OH. Today, April 28, 2008, Dr. Buell will teach his final class before stepping down as a full-time professor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professor Buell received his Ph.D. in political science from Vanderbilt University after earning his undergraduate and M.A. at Louisiana State University. He has taught at Denison since the 1969 to 1970 academic year and has directed the Richard G. Lugar Program in Politics and Public Service since its inception in 1995. This program provides students with opportunities to study various aspects of public policy, combining classroom instruction with the practical application of these studies through  an internship experience. As of July 2007, about 110 students in the program will have served as interns in congressional offices. Given his exemplary leadership and record of success, Dr. Buell was subsequently installed as the inaugural holder of the Richard G. Lugar Chair in Public Policy on April 21, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Emmett Buell is a nationally recognized expert in the political science field and specifically on Presidential selection and negative campaigning in Presidential elections. He has authored, coauthored, or coedited four books, including "Attack Politics: Negativity in Presidential Campaigns Since 1960". Emmett also has authored or coauthored articles and research notes in the American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, American Politics Quarterly, Urban Affairs Quarterly,  Social Science Quarterly, and the Journal of Law &amp; Politics. In addition, he has written chapters for books edited by others on such topics as the invisible primary, the New Hampshire primary, the changing role of national party conventions, and news coverage of Presidential aspirants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside of his impressive list of experiences and skills, I know Emmett to be an individual of high integrity and character. He is idealistic, while remaining grounded in the practical. He is serious and thoughtful, while maintaining a sense of humor. He is generous with his time and attention, without losing his focus and personal discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Buell has been an inspirational mentor to hundreds of students. His office door has always been open, and he makes every effort to assist, promote, and encourage those who seek guidance. I have heard from many individuals, including those who have worked in my own office, that they would not be in their employment positions today if it were not for his assistance. Likewise, I know that he is immensely proud of these students and their accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Buell is also legendary on the Denison campus for his devotion to personal fitness and mastery of racquetball. He has encouraged numerous student challenges on the racquetball court throughout his career and has almost always been on the victorious side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was pleased to join with many of these former students, along with numerous faculty and friends, in celebration of Emmett's career at a retirement ceremony on Saturday, April 19, 2008. I am delighted that this event provided a forum to share our admiration for his years of service and contribution to Denison University.</paragraph>
