    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the break, I was home in my district in  Memphis, Tennessee, and I spoke to 40 soldiers who had been to the Middle East. They were being honored. I asked many of them if they wanted to return. Most, nearly all, said, "No. Why are we there and what are we accomplishing?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked groups about their thoughts, and almost to a one, they said, "Bring the troops home; don't stay the course."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would submit to the President that he went to war under Donald Rumsfeld's opinion that you fight the war with the troops you have got.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the President should support the troops with the bill that the Congress sends him. We have sent him a bill that supports the troops, supports the veterans and, yet, brings our troops home. We must end this foolishness in Iraq, the loss of American lives and the spending of our tax dollars in a country where we are not wanted.</paragraph>
