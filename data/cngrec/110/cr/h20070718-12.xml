  <narrative>ALL NIGHT SENATE SESSION -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7999]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Senate was in session all night long because Senate Republicans refuse to allow a fair up or down vote on an amendment that would redeploy our troops by April of next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Senate Democrats want a vote on an amendment offered by Senators Levin and Reed, but Republicans are using the filibuster to prevent a fair majority vote. Do Senate Republicans really want to obstruct the process on the most critical issue of our time?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are demanding change in Iraq, and while a majority of Senate Republicans refuse to listen, nearly a dozen Republicans have said the administration must change its strategy in Iraq. These Republicans need to realize that their words are important, but they will only have meaning if they choose to act and support the Levin-Reed amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that President Bush has no intention of making any changes in his war policy, and so it is up to Congress to force that change, which is why last night's all-night debate in the Senate was so important. Let's hope wayward Senate Republicans are finally listening.</paragraph>
