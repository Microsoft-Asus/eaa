  <narrative>THE VALUE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11698]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, according to today's Baltimore Sun, there have been 240 homicides in my hometown of Baltimore City, 22 more deaths than this time last year. Unfortunately, many of these victims and their families will not have closure because of the inability of law enforcement to bring their killers to justice. This is due in large part to the fear that witnesses have in coming forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Witness intimidation is a serious threat to our justice system. According to the National Institute of Justice, 51 percent of prosecutors in large jurisdictions find witness intimidation to be a major problem. In Baltimore City, it is estimated that witness intimidation occurs in 90 percent of the cases that are prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, protecting witnesses is a core government function. It is standard in the Federal system, and State and local prosecutors should have the same tools. However, there is a great disparity between funding and witness services, if any, that are provided by local authorities and those of the Federal Witness Security Program within the United States Marshals Service that operates on a $40 million budget to assist 17,500 witnesses and their family members with gaining new lives, new identities,  and new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel recently reported on the problems associated with inadequate witness protection programs. Maurice Pulley was shot to death in front of his home, the apparent victim of retaliation for agreeing to cooperate with authorities. Just three days prior to his death, Mr. Pulley had agreed to testify as a witnesses against Calvin Glover for shooting him on June 30; however, law enforcement was not able to offer him assistance because the witness program in the county was  essentially terminated due to budget cuts. The sheriff even admitted to occasionally relying on private funding to relocate witnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the same week, the Denver Post told a story of Javad Marshall-Fields and his fiancee, who were gunned down just days before he was scheduled to testify against Robert Ray. In 2004, Robert Ray shot and killed one person and wounded two others, including Javad Marshall-Fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A program to protect State witnesses has been in existence in Colorado for over 12 years; however, the budget was recently cut from $100,000 to $50,000. Unfortunately, it now allows for a little more than a bus ticket or security deposit for a new apartment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make matters worse, it appears that no one told Javad that this program even existed, even though prosecutors filed a motion to keep his address and those of five other witnesses secret due to their fear of retribution. Why was Javad not notified of the program? His mom was told that it was because he did not ask.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as I always say, there is nothing worse than a person not knowing what they don't know. This is why I recently teamed up with Baltimore City's State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy to film a public service announcement encouraging people in the communities to come forward if they have witnessed a crime, or if they have already come forward and feel they may need protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I have introduced <bill type="h" number="933">H.R. 933</bill>, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007, that authorizes $270 million over the next 3 years to enable State and local prosecutors who demonstrate a need for funds to protect witnesses in cases involving gangs or other violence to establish short-term witness protection programs. This legislation will assist in correcting the inequity that exists between the Federal and State level. I call upon my colleagues to support its enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving protection for State and local witnesses will move us one step closer to alleviating the fears and threats to prospective witnesses and help safeguard our communities from violence. It is time that we show our commitment to our constituents and the justice system, because without witnesses, there can be no justice.</paragraph>
