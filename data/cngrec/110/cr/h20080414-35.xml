    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tomorrow Pope Benedict XVI will make his first papal visit to the United States of America. This is an exciting time for America and the over 64 million American Catholics to celebrate the relationship between our Nation and The Vatican and our continued work towards peace and humanitarian needs around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his trip, the Pope will visit New York City and Washington, D.C., where he will attend Mass at Nationals Park and Yankee Stadium, visit the World Trade Center site, and attend ceremonies and meetings at the White House with President George W. Bush. As an extraordinary sign of respect, the President will welcome the Pope at Andrew's Air Force Base in Maryland and escort him to the White House. Pope Benedict is just the third Pope to visit the United States, and this visit marks the 25th  meeting between a sitting President and a Pope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the citizens of the Second Congressional District of South Carolina, I welcome Pope Benedict to the United States. I hope his visit will be a positive reminder of the importance of our relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Welcome Michael McCrory Wilson, who was born on April 11, 2008, at Lexington Medical Center, West Columbia, South Carolina.</paragraph>
