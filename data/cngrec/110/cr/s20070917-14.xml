  <narrative>NOMINATION OF JUDGE MICHAEL MUKASEY -- (Senate - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11540">S11540</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to address two topics quickly, and I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first wish to speak to the President's announcement this morning that he is going to ask the Senate to confirm Judge Michael Mukasey as the new Attorney General for the United States. I had an occasion to meet with Judge Mukasey this morning, and I have been reading throughout the last several months a great deal of what he has written, particularly on matters of national security and intelligence gathering. I find him to be very thoughtful and a highly qualified person for this position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply wish to make the point to my colleagues that I am looking forward to this confirmation process, first as a member of the Judiciary Committee and then as a matter before the full body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think my colleagues will find Judge Mukasey not only highly qualified, being a graduate of Columbia and Yale Law School, but also someone who has an extraordinarily fine reputation on the bench and bar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After practicing law and serving as a U.S. assistant attorney, Judge Mukasey, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, served 18 distinguished years on the Federal bench in New York as chief of the New York division. During that period of time, he acquired a reputation of the highest order, someone who is tough but fair, someone who is highly respected by his peers and the litigants who appeared before him and, as I said, who has presided over some of the most difficult and high-profile cases to  come before the bench, particularly in matters dealing with terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to the confirmation process. I note that Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern that many of the positions in the Attorney General's Office have been vacant. I believe now there  are 9 out of 15 high-level positions in the Department of Justice vacant, including the position of Attorney General. It is clear that we need to get the nominee dealt with as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average time for confirming an Attorney General is 3 1/2  weeks, and I am hopeful we can use our time wisely to confirm Judge Mukasey within that period of time.</paragraph>
