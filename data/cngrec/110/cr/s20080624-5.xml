    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have a very busy schedule this week. We have some work we need to complete. We have, of course, FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; we have the supplemental appropriations bill; we have the tax extenders; we have Medicare we need to complete; and, of course, we are on housing today. Regarding that, following any remarks I make and those of the Republican leader, we will return to the House message to accompany <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the housing reform legislation.  There will be up to an hour of debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Dodd-Shelby substitute with respect to the housing reform bill. Senators have until 10:30 a.m. today to file amendments to the Dodd-Shelby substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By virtue of the previous order, the Senate will be in recess from 12:30 until 2:15 today for our weekly business luncheons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say a couple of other things. We are going to do a number of judges this afternoon, the exact number of which we don't have worked out just yet, but we are going to do three circuit court judges and some district court judges. I have to confer with Senator Leahy on the number of district court judges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say to my friend the distinguished Republican leader that I spoke to Senator Feingold this morning regarding the FEC nominations, and it appears very clear we should be able to do them today. In regard to that, I wish to underscore my desire--our desire--to constitute the Federal Election Commission so it is working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a brief history, Mr. President. Before Memorial Day, there were four FEC nominations pending--two Republicans, two Democrats. At that time, we offered to confirm those nominees by unanimous consent. The Republicans did not take me up on that offer. There would have been five FEC Commissioners today had that been done. In fact, it would have been prior to that recess. There would have been enough to conduct all official business. There was a thought, I assume, on the part of the Republicans  that they wanted a full six, and I understand that. So they rejected the offer I made. They wanted to wait until a replacement for the failed nomination of Hans von Spakovsky was received in the Senate. I told the Republicans in December that von Spakovsky would not be approved by this body. Someone should have been cleared to replace him long before now. Nonetheless, I pledged to swiftly move that new nominee, and we have done that. I implored</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I discussed on Friday, Senator Feingold--I didn't mention his name at the time, but it is out in the press since then--would like to meet with each of the nominees. That will be completed today. These meetings are important to the Senator. He has the right to do that. I certainly compliment him for caring so much. Four of the five FEC nominations now pending are relatively new to the Senate, and it is certainly within Senator Feingold's right to speak with them prior to their  confirmation. This is not unusual. So I look forward to completing that, unless something comes up that I don't understand, and we should be able to do that today. It is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been some concern raised by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the Democrats have set out to delay this FEC being reconstituted so that the Democratic National Committee's lawsuit against Senator McCain may be heard in the court. The DNC sued McCain, alleging that he violated campaign finance laws in the treatment of his primary campaign funding. The court dismissed that suit without prejudice, saying the DNC needed to give the FEC 120 days to act on  its complaint before coming to court. The 120 days expires today, June 24.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is simply no truth to the argument that we are playing this game with the FEC. Democrats have been trying to get the FEC running since it went dark in December. Repeatedly, the Republicans have objected to consent request after consent request. This lawsuit of the DNC's has been out there many months. The decision for setting the deadline for FEC action was made prior to our Memorial Day recess, and the offer to confirm the pending nominations was made before that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this means is that Democrats offered to confirm the four pending FEC nominees--which would have stopped the DNC suit--before Memorial Day. If we were trying to help the DNC's suit, would we have made that offer? I don't think so. Would we offer to waive the hearing and the markup for both Republican nominees so it would be moved quickly? The answer would be no. Of course we wouldn't have done that, Mr. President. As I have told my colleagues, Democrats want a functional agency as soon as  possible. That could have happened in May. It could happen today. We want to do everything we can to reconstitute the FEC. It is extremely important to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have mentioned the matters we need to complete, and, of course, the one thing I didn't mention was the FAA extension. I asked unanimous consent to do that, and that was objected to yesterday by my friend Senator Kyl on behalf of Senator DeMint. I hope we can get that done. The House is going to pass that today as a temporary extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also are going to bring before the body, within the next 24 hours, the PEPFAR legislation. What is that? It is the AIDS legislation that the President is in favor of and which we have been trying to move. It has been held up on the other side by a Senator or two, and we hope we can complete that. Again, I will ask unanimous consent that be passed today. It is my understanding, having spoken with Senator Enzi, that he and Senator Biden have worked something out on that, and  hopefully the Senator on the other side who is objecting to this will no longer object to it.</paragraph>
