  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medicare prescription drug insurance program continues to exceed expectations. The current private sector approach has resulted in more choices available to Medicare beneficiaries while simultaneously keeping costs below previous projections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of seniors are satisfied with the program and are saving on average $1,200 a year. Seniors are able to choose a prescription drug plan that meets their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office has stated that requiring the Federal Government to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturer will not result in any savings to the Federal Treasury or the taxpayer. When asked, seniors support lower drug prices; but when told that means less choice of available drug or pharmacy, they disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seniors across America want their doctors, not the Federal Government, to choose the most effective drugs.</paragraph>
