  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas religious intolerance and discrimination continue to be the root causes of many of the conflicts around the world;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States of America was founded by those seeking to practice their religion freely, and the American justice system, including all legal professionals involved, should be working to uphold this principle;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances";</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution states, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its  jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National High School Mock Trial Championship has been, until this date, a prestigious event that requires a tremendous amount of preparation, skill, and dedication on behalf of those students who are competing, and is looked upon with distinction by institutions of higher learning;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National High School Mock Trial Championship is a program based on constitutional law;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the sponsor of the 2005 competition stated that, "The National High School Mock Trial Championship is a participatory program that engages students, legal professionals and the educational community to advance the understanding of the American justice system and the important role of lawyers. A well-educated public translates into a more engaged citizenry that is better equipped and more interested in fulfilling their civic responsibilities"; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National High School Mock Trial Championship espouses the goals of heightening "appreciation of the principle of equal justice for all" and promoting the "exchange of ideas among students from throughout the United States";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the usual National High School Mock Trial Championship schedule consists of two rounds on Friday and two rounds on Saturday, followed by a Championship round on Saturday;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Torah Academy of Bergen County of Teaneck, New Jersey, won the 2005 New Jersey State Bar Foundation High School tournament, and was eligible to compete in the National High School Mock Trial Championship;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the members of the mock trial team from Torah Academy observe the Sabbath, in accordance with their practice of Orthodox Judaism, and would not have been able to participate in any National High School Mock Trial Championship competitions from sundown on Friday through sundown on Saturday without certain accommodations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas satisfactory accommodations were made to allow Torah Academy of Teaneck, New Jersey, to compete during the last National High School Mock Trial Championship held in Charlotte, North Carolina, from May 5-7, 2005, without violating the religious practices of the students;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a review of the post-host report compiled after the 2005 Championship showed a majority of the comments supported the accommodations made for the Torah Academy students and the benefit of competing with the Torah Academy students;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas one respondent replied, "the compromise demonstrated fairness, tolerance and problem-solving, all values that I try to encourage in my students";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship voted on October 15, 2005, to refuse any future accommodations for students who observe Sabbath on Friday and/or Saturday;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas students who have otherwise met all of the criteria to participate in the qualifying competitions leading to the National High School Mock Trial Championship should be able to compete regardless of their religious affiliation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Board of Trustees of the New Jersey State Bar Foundation unanimously voted at its October 27, 2005, meeting that New Jersey will not compete in the National High School Mock Trial Championship unless the National Board establishes a policy permitting accommodation for religious observance;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on January 6, 2006, the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers also officially withdrew from participating in the National High School Mock Trial Championship because the National Board would not make changes to the competition's schedule to accommodate students with religious restrictions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the decision of the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to refuse any future accommodations for students who observe their Sabbath on Friday and/or Saturday adversely and wrongly impacts observant Jewish, Muslim, and Seventh-Day Adventist students;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the decision made by the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship is inconsistent with the spirit of freedom of religion or equal protection; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas all students should be allowed to both compete fully in the National High School Mock Trial Championship and uphold the practice of their religion: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) calls on the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to accommodate the religious beliefs of students participating in the competition; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) urges the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to restructure the rules of the competition to allow qualifying students of all faiths to compete fully in this national championship without betraying their religious beliefs.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="25">H. Res. 25</bill>, a resolution that calls on the National High School Mock Trial Championship board of directors to make provisions in the championship schedule to accommodate the religious faiths of all potential students and participants. This legislation was introduced by Mr. Rothman, my colleague from New Jersey, who has worked diligently on this issue to see that fairness and tolerance prevails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National High School Mock Trial Championship is a competition between winning high schools on a national level designed to showcase bright and talented high school students. The event requires intense preparation, skill and dedication for those who reach the high level of competition. The current championship takes place on weekends. There are two rounds on Friday, two rounds on Saturday, and a championship round that occurs later on Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, just a couple of years ago, this schedule caused an imposition to a team in that competition. The Torah Academy of Teaneck, New Jersey was scheduled to participate after winning the 2005 New Jersey State Bar Foundation high school tournament. Now, this school, without proper accommodation, would not have been able to compete because of their orthodox religious practice to observe the Sabbath from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. In that instance, the board of the competition  made a proper accommodation for the students' religious faiths. The team was able to compete in May of that year. Those who took part in that competition recognized that the adjustment made by the board showed fairness and tolerance, and it was a good way to approach a problem. All participating applauded the board</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, a number of legal organizations then withdrew their participation and support for the National High School Mock Trial Championship pointing to this act of the board of directors that quite clearly undermines free religious spirit, the kind of spirit on which this country was based. It is not without irony that this was applied in a competition that is intended for legal and constitutional education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution before us today from Mr. Rothman and cosponsored by a number of us calls on the mock trial championship to recognize the diverse religious views and practices in this country and to restore its rules in order to accommodate excellent students of all faiths. I commend Mr. Rothman for pursuing this. We hope that this can be resolved in a way that is most inclusive and in the spirit, the constitutional spirit, of equality of religious practice in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 25. I thank my colleague for his opening remarks. This resolution calls on the board of directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to accommodate students of all religious faiths. Among our most basic human rights, the right to follow one's conscience in matters of religion and belief, is undoubtedly one of the most cherished, so much so that people have been willing to endure the severest trials and even to lay down  their lives rather than surrender this fundamental right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout history, men and women of religion have fought for the natural right of all individuals to practice their own faith and beliefs free from harassment, suppression and persecution. One can also point to many shining examples of established religions tolerating each other's beliefs and practices. The National High School Mock Trial Championship, which is based on constitutional law, is a prestigious event that requires a tremendous amount of preparation, skill and dedication on behalf  of those students who are competing. The competition espouses the goals of heightening "appreciation of the principle of equal justice for all" and promoting the "exchange of ideas among students from throughout the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This participatory program engages students, legal professionals and the  educational community to advance the understanding of the American justice system and the important role of lawyers. I have to admit sometimes that I have a prejudice against some of my lawyer friends. Nevertheless, they are clearly an integral part of our system of the rule of law and justice for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 15, 2005, the board of directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship voted to refuse any future accommodations for students who observe the Sabbath on Friday and/or Saturday. This decision of the board of directors to refuse any future accommodations adversely and wrongly impacts observant Jewish, Muslim and Seventh Day Adventist students and is inconsistent with the spirit of freedom of religion and equal protection guaranteed by our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>During the 2005 championships, satisfactory accommodations were made to allow Torah Academy of Teaneck, New Jersey, to compete at the National High School Mock Trial Championship held in Charlotte, North Carolina. A review of the post-host report compiled afterward showed a majority of the comments supported the accommodations made for the Torah Academy students and the benefit of competing with the Torah Academy students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is an important point in this debate. All the other participants, even recognizing the challenge from a significant competitor, thought this was the right thing to do. One respondent replied, "The compromise demonstrated fairness, tolerance and problem-solving, all values that I try to encourage in my students."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The simple fact is that all students should be allowed to both compete fully in the National High School Mock Trial Championship and uphold the practice of their religion. We stand here today calling the National Board of Directors to accommodate the religious beliefs of students participating in the competition and urge the Board of Directors of the National High School Mock Trial Championship to restructure the rules of the competition to allow qualifying students of all faiths to compete fully  in this national championship without betraying their religious beliefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, Mr. Rothman, for bringing this matter to the floor today, and I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), the author of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400346" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first let me thank my distinguished friend and colleague, Mr. Holt from New Jersey, for his leadership on this issue and his support from the very beginning. It was critical. I am most grateful, as are all the students who will now be able to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to thank my friend and colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) for his kind remarks and his support of this resolution, which will bring fairness and restore a sense of equal justice under the law to a program we are hopeful has the potential to provide valuable lessons to all our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2005 there was a National High School Mock Trial Championship competition all over America, just like there has been for many years. There were literally hundreds of schools in New Jersey, as there are hundreds of schools in other States, participating in this competition, and, by the way, hundreds of schools, public schools, private schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That year, in 2005, the Torah Academy, an Orthodox Yeshiva located in Teaneck, New Jersey, won the New Jersey State championship. And they won the right to represent our beloved Garden State in the National High School Mock Trial Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How awful it was for them to learn that if they had proceeded in the competition to the semifinals and finals, they wouldn't be able to participate because the semifinals and finals had been scheduled on a Saturday, on their Sabbath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we went to the National High School Mock Trial Championship, they were at first very reluctant to accommodate these students, although every conceivable reason that they might have, they had to get more buses, move people from one place to another, would have been accommodated and provided for them. In the end, they did the right thing, and they allowed these students to participate. All they did was move the championships then to Sunday instead of Saturday, without objection from anyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague from Minnesota has said, the results of the inclusion of these students not only demonstrated fairness, tolerance and problem-solving, but was a demonstration to all those involved, particularly the young people, that accommodations for religious practice, when reasonable, should be put into place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the decision of the board of this National High School Mock Trial Championship to never again permit such an accommodation, whether it be an Orthodox Jewish school or a Muslim school or a Seventh Day Adventist school, was wrong, and we couldn't talk them out of it. The question was how to impress upon them that this was un-American and that the Congress of the United States wouldn't stand for it. That is why we drafted this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember, these are students who played by the rules, were eligible to participate, competed, and won in their State championships, all according to the rules. The organization in fact demonstrated that they could accommodate these students without any problems whatsoever, and, in fact, with a very positive result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I urge all the Members of the House to join me and my distinguished colleagues in supporting House Resolution 25, to express our body's strong disapproval of the decision made by the board of the National Mock Trial Championship not to make any attempt in the future to accommodate students of all faiths in future events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, the most important purpose of this mock trial championship was to teach about the rule of law; and part of our rule of law here in America is equal justice under the law, no matter where you come from, what your religion is, as well as equal access to the law. As we pride ourselves on these values, it is important for the United States House of Representatives to pass this resolution to convey in the strongest terms its hope that the National High School Mock Trial Championship Board  will revisit its decision to deny accommodations for students who observe the Sabbath on Friday and Saturday, and instead schedule future competitions in such a way that enable all eligible students to participate, regardless of their religion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was sitting here listening to my distinguished colleagues speak and looking at my own notes, and, again, I just find it incredible that you have this wonderful competition which espouses the goals of heightening the appreciation of the principle of equal justice for all stated, a stated goal, and yet it couldn't make accommodation to respect the religious beliefs and practices of the competitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I urge all my colleagues to join in support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield balance the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400346" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I did want to point out that good people have not stood silently during all of this. Both the New Jersey State Bar Association and the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers have withdrawn from the National High School Mock Trial Championships and have established their own mock trial competition, which ensures that all students, regardless of affiliation, religious affiliation, can participate in every aspect of the annual contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend these organizations. That may be the direction to go, to ask people of all good will to remove themselves from the National High School Mock Trial Championships if they will not accommodate students of all religions who are otherwise eligible to participate. I hope it doesn't come to that, but so far the board of the National High School Mock Trial Championship has not been willing to accommodate all these students.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish this resolution were not necessary, but maybe we should welcome this and embrace it as a teachable moment, not only to understand the religious tenets, practices, and traditions of various people in this country, but also to understand what it means to say we are a Nation dedicated to the proposition that all are equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one said that the freedoms we cherish need be convenient. They do require from each of us, from time to time, accommodation, even inconvenience. This is a teachable moment, an important lesson in tolerance, equality and, yes, accommodation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman) for bringing this forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="25">H. Res. 25</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
