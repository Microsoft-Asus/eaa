  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, my colleagues and I questioned the CEO of Blackwater and lead figures in the Department of State regarding private security contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of this hearing, I was absolutely alarmed and shocked by the stark reality that private contractors such as Blackwater have possibly created a shadow military of mercenary troops that are not accountable to the United States Government or to anyone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With 180,000 Americans, Iraqis and nationals from other countries who operate under an array of Federal contracts provide everything from security and intelligence gathering to infrastructure building and transporting supplies to a country nearly the size of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more alarming is the fact that Blackwater and similar private contractors make up the largest security force in Iraq. There are currently over 20,000 more contractors than the total U.S. military forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With these numbers, one may suspect the contractors are being utilized, in part, to mask the true extent of our involvement in Iraq. I am also concerned with the fact that many contractors such as those working for Blackwater are simply held to a different standard, where circumventing criminal law, rules of engagement and even the Geneva Conventions have become far too commonplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been 195 escalation of force incidents from Blackwater alone since 2005, including several previously unreported killings of Iraqi civilians. In 80 percent of these instances, Blackwater fired first. This "shoot now and ask questions later" attitude has resulted in further distrust amongst Iraqis for American military forces and the Iraqi Interior Ministry demanding that Blackwater cease its operations in Iraq, all during a time when winning the cooperation of Iraqi civilians and  government is critical for our success for our mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to these and other incidents, Blackwater has undermined our strategic mission in Iraq and possibly stifled our already sensitive relationship with Iraq's neighboring states, those  same countries where garnering multilateral and bilateral support is critical to solidifying political reconciliation in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has consistently stated that he wants to win the hearts and the minds of Iraqis. However, the ongoing use of Blackwater contractors that are consistently beyond legal reach is not the way to achieve that goal. Blackwater is clearly the realization of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's vision of a "hollow military," where everything that can be privatized and outsourced will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Blackwater appears to be held above the law, as the State Department continues to make little effort to hold it accountable, while continuing to award contracts amounting to over $1 billion since 2000, $300 million of which were awarded as no-bid contracts. Clearly it is time for a new direction beyond the failed policy in Iraq, which has been further deteriorated by the administration's use of inept privatized security contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That new direction begins with outlining a clear statement on appropriate and detailed contingency plans for a reasonable redeployment of troops from Iraq, including consideration of force protection for military and civilian personnel and a need to continue to protect our vital national security interests as mandated in Representatives Abercrombie, Tanner and Turner's bill, <bill type="h" number="3087">H.R. 3087</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As such, the passage of <bill type="h" number="3087">H.R. 3087</bill> is a clear step in the right direction, that our men and women in uniform not sacrifice another 3,800 lives without a clear strategy for redeploying our troops. We recognize that, since the planning of the redeployment of our troops from Iraq is a complex status, we must plan accordingly as to not repeat the mistakes made in the original planning for the Iraq invasion and post-war occupation.</paragraph>
