  <narrative>CHAMP ACT AND DENTAL HEALTH -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8607]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the Children's Health Medicare Protection Act, entitled CHAMP, of 2007,  which makes great strides in improving our Nation's health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It chills the conscience to think that approximately 9 million children are currently without health insurance. An estimated 18,000 Americans died last year because they did not have access to health care, many of them sadly were children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no justice until all of our children, our most valuable resource, are granted access to the most technologically advanced system in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals travel from every corner of the globe to access our high-quality health care. Yet, we cannot seem to provide care to the individuals in our own backyard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHAMP Act would begin to begin to change that injustice, committing $50 billion to reauthorize and improve the State Children's Health Insurance Program, our Nation's health care safety net for low-income, uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act does not expand the SCHIP benefit to wealthy children or adults, as some would argue. It merely provides benefits to the same low-income children who we originally intended to cover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of the 9 million children who are currently uninsured are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, but do not receive the benefits because of enrollment barriers and underfunding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHAMP Act will lift the barriers and raise the funding so we can get our children the care they so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great enthusiasm that I support this landmark legislation. I am pleased that my colleagues have been able to rise above the political rhetoric to develop legislation that will have a significant impact for our Nation's most vulnerable children. I am also pleased that my chairman shares my commitment to improving children's access to dental care. The chairman recognizes, as I do, that oral health is an overall component of overall health, and we cannot afford to ignore the dental health  needs of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud efforts to include a dental benefits package and dental quality assurance methods in the CHAMP Act. I also want to thank the chairman and of my fellow colleagues from Maryland, including Congressman Albert Wynn, for their support of two initiatives that I had promoted to increase children's access to dental care under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first would allow federally qualified health centers to contract with private-practice dentists, significantly enhancing our Nation's dental safety net. The second one requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide educational materials to new mothers on the importance of oral health and the services available to their children, with the goal of stopping dental disease before it even starts. Both initiatives will cost little or nothing, while yielding excellent results for  our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Wynn and I know the importance of protecting our children from dental disease. It was a short 5 months ago that a 12-year-old Maryland boy died when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. Forty dollars worth of dental care might have saved his life, but he never got that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before, Deamonte Driver's case was rare and extreme, but he was by no means alone in his suffering. Dental disease is the single most common chronic disease in this country, and it is preventable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, all it takes on our part is the will to protect our children. I am pleased that so many Members of Congress have demonstrated this will, and I encourage all my colleagues to support the vitally important CHAMP Act.</paragraph>
