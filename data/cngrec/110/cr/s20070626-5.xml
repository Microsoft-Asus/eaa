    <paragraph>Madam President, yesterday the U.S. Conference of Mayors highlighted the toll of the Iraq war, the toll it is taking on our health, safety, and well-being here at home, by voting for a resolution to bring the war to a responsible end. Stanford, CT, Mayor Dan Malloy said the war has drained desperately needed funds from classrooms and municipal services. David Cicilline, Mayor of Providence, RI, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continued U.S. military presence in Iraq is resulting in the tragic loss of American lives and wounding of American soldiers ..... reducing federal funds for needed domestic investments in education, health care, public safety, homeland security and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mayors understand this as much as any other political body in the country. They are the ones who are seeing that desperately needed funds are not going to projects they believe are so important to their constituents, the people who live within those cities, because the money is going at the rate of $10 billion a month to Iraq. I appreciate the Conference of Mayors for taking the important stand they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, last evening, just before the Senate went out, Richard Lugar, former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee today, made a very important speech, one of the most important speeches we have had in the Senate in a long time. He is a soft-spoken man and doesn't really talk a lot. He is a Rhodes scholar, a brilliant man, an academic with experience, prior to coming here, as  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="8378">S8378</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>appreciate what he did last night, what he said last night. On foreign policy, he has the credentials to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, he gave voice to the growing sentiment among his Republican colleagues that we must change course in Iraq and change now--not in September but now. Senator Lugar said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recommend and suggest to all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, that they read the brilliant speech given by DICK LUGAR last night. It was very good. It was, I am sure, prepared by him, every word. I understand it is not easy to speak out against the war. I can vouch for that. I also recognize how difficult it is for Republicans to speak out against the war. It has been hard enough for this Democrat to speak out against the war. Senator Lugar's comments and those of a handful  of other Republicans who share his view--to this point, two have said so publicly--takes real courage. Courage is the only way we will change course in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some floor speeches go unnoticed. Most floor speeches go unnoticed. Senator RICHARD LUGAR's speech last night is not one of them. When this war comes to an end--and it will come to an end--and the history books are written--and they will be written--Senator Lugar's words yesterday could be remembered as a turning point in this intractable civil war in Iraq. But that will depend on whether more Republicans take the stand Senator Lugar took, a courageous stand, last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Senator Lugar--and hope and believe a growing number of Republicans--to put his words into action by delivering a responsible end to the war that the American people demand and the American people deserve.</paragraph>
