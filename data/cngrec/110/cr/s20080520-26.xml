  <chair> Under the previous order, there will be 15 minutes equally divided and controlled between the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and the junior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, or their designees.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Illinois is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will take the time allotted on the Democratic side to Senator Webb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have heard the sad news about our friend TED KENNEDY. Those of us who stood by his side know that there is no better ally and no more determined fighter. Now, as TED KENNEDY faces another great fight, we know he will bring the same courage and determination to the battle. We also know TED has spent his entire life caring for those in need. It is time for those of us who love TED and his family to care for them and join in prayer to give them strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at 2:30 we will consider the nomination of Steven Agee of Virginia to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It is a lifetime appointment. He is a consensus nominee. Both Senators WARNER and WEBB support him. Of the 11 appellate court nominees pending before the Senate, only 6 can claim the same home State Senator support. That is one of the reasons some of them have been delayed. If we work more toward bipartisan consensus, more nominations would  be approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, it is difficult to hear criticisms that these nominations have been delayed. The Republican minority has delayed so many bills and so many matters in this Congress, they have set a new record for filibusters and delay. That is a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has confirmed 303 judges for lifetime appointments during the Bush Presidency. President Bush has had 86 percent of his judicial nominees confirmed; President Clinton, only 75 percent. When it comes to circuit court nominees, President Bush has even had a higher confirmation rate than President Clinton--71 percent to 57 percent. There has been no mistreatment here when it comes to the nominees sent to us by the Bush White House. Under  President  Clinton, 61 judicial nominees were not even given the courtesy of a hearing and a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the problems that faces the analysis on the Republican side is that there have been fewer judicial vacancies. President Clinton had 377 judges confirmed; President Reagan, 382, but at the present time, with the 303 already confirmed, if every vacancy were filled--every one of them--then President Bush would have fewer than President Clinton or President Reagan had confirmed. In other words, the fact that President Bush will have appointed fewer judges than his predecessors is a function  of math, not political mischief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another complaint we have heard from my Republican colleagues is that we are moving on Sixth Circuit nominee Helene White ahead of three circuit court nominees whom they would prefer. Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and the majority leader have already addressed this point, but I think the record should be abundantly clear. Helene White was originally nominated in January 1997 and was pending as a Clinton nominee for 1,532 days--over 4 years--until March 2001. You  can even argue that she has been pending for over 11 years. So in terms of a place in line, she certainly deserves consideration for her patience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope these battles will be resolved and resolved soon, but most importantly I hope they are resolved with good men and women who come to these lifetime appointments with the appropriate background and appropriate temperament to serve this Nation well. I hope the Senate will join on a bipartisan basis in approving this afternoon's pending nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today it is my distinct pleasure to offer my support--along with my colleague, Senator Warner--for the nomination of Justice G. Steven Agee to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Agee is regarded as a jurist of superior intellect and judicial temperament who exhibits the highest degree of integrity and professionalism. After graduating law school, Justice Agee began his legal career as an associate with Martin, Hopkins &amp; Lemon, 1977 to 1979. In 1979, Justice Agee joined Rocovich, Dechow, Parvin &amp; Wilson, P.C., where he did additional work as an associate. From 1980 to 2000 Justice Agee was a shareholder and director with Osterhoudt, Ferguson, Natt, Aheron &amp; Agee.  In 2001, Justice Agee began serving as a judge on the Court of Appeals of Virginia and has been a justice on the Supreme Court of Virginia since 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Agee has unparalleled support from the entire legal community in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Justice Agee served for 12 years in the Virginia House of Delegates--1982 to 1994--and served as an appointed member of the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission, 1997 to 2000. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Justice Agee "well qualified" to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He is active in myriad community and civic organizations. Justice  Agee received his B.A., magna cum laude, from Bridgewater College in 1974, his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1977, and his L.L.M. in Taxation from New York University School of Law in 1978. He is married to Nancy Howell Agee, the chief operating officer and executive vice president of Carilion Clinic, and together they have one child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am acutely aware of the vitally important role that the Constitution assigns to the Senate in the advise and consent process related to Federal judges. Judgeships on our Nation's Circuit Courts of Appeal are critical to the American system of jurisprudence. Senator Warner and I undertook a careful and deliberative process to find the most qualified nominees. Our collaborative process involved a thorough records review and rigorous interviews. We are of the opinion that Justice Agee  not only met our high standards for selection but exceeded them. Justice Agee was on the joint list of recommended nominees that we submitted to President Bush last year. We are pleased that President Bush has chosen to respect our diligent bipartisan work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks about Justice Agee today and for the expeditious way the Senate has moved his nomination through the process during the 110th Congress. Again, it is with pride that I join Senator Warner in commending Justice Agee to each of my colleagues in the Senate, and I ask my fellow Senators to vote to confirm his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time remains that is controlled by the Senator from Vermont?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has 3 minutes 40 seconds remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note, in all these numbers, we Democrats have worked very hard to erase what was done by the Republicans when there was a Democratic President. They pocket filibustered over 60 of President Clinton's nominees. They let one go through--actually voted for him in committee, one of the most distinguished African-American jurists in this country. Then, in lockstep, every single Republican voted against him--a humiliation for him. He went on to become chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who seeks recognition?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for an extraordinary nominee to the federal bench. I welcome the opportunity today to vote in favor of confirmation for the Honorable G. Steven Agee to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Agee currently serves with distinction on the Supreme Court of Virginia. It was my privilege to introduce him to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, and, as I expressed to the committee, Justice Agee's qualifications to serve on the Fourth Circuit are as impressive as any circuit court nominee for whom I have voted in my 30 years in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I am pleased to note that the American Bar Association concurs with my assessment of this nominee. The ABA gave Justice Agee its highest recommendation: unanimously well-qualified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Agee's nomination is a product of a collaborative process between the administration and Virginia's two U.S. Senators. In early 2007, Senator Webb and I personally, extensively interviewed more than a dozen individuals to serve on the Fourth Circuit, and ultimately, in June 2007, we submitted to the President a list of five individuals that both of us would strongly support for confirmation. Justice Agee was one of those five individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A magna cum laude graduate of Bridgewater College in Virginia, Steve Agee subsequently earned his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law and an L.L.M. in Taxation from New York University. For the past 30 years, he has been engaged in the Virginia legal community as either a practicing lawyer or as a jurist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his remarkable legal career, Justice Agee has been actively engaged in public service through the military, elected office, the state bench, and other civic and volunteer causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 11 years during his career in private practice, he served in the U.S. Army Reserve, Judge Advocate General Corps, completing his service at the rank of major in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1982 to 1994, Steve Agee was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the city of Salem; the Counties of Craig, Montgomery, and Roanoke; and the towns of Christiansburg, New Castle, and Vinton to Virginia's General Assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, the Virginia General Assembly unanimously confirmed Steve Agee to the Virginia Court of Appeals. In January 2003, the General Assembly once again unanimously confirmed Judge Agee--this time to one of seven seats on the Virginia Supreme Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, he has been a member of the Board of Trustees for Bridgewater College; a member of the Board of Directors for the Bradley Free Clinic of Roanoke; a member of the Salem Rotary Club; and he has also contributed his time to the Western Virginia Foundation for the Arts and Sciences  and the Governor's Regional Economic Development Council for the New Century Region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Agee is obviously a very accomplished American. I appreciate the Senate Judiciary Committee's prompt consideration of this nominee, as the seat to which he has been nominated is designated as a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident that Justice Steve Agee will serve on the Fourth Circuit with distinction, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of his confirmation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my colleague. I would like to add just one more word, if I may.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just received the news with regard to a dearly beloved Member of this Chamber, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. It has been my privilege to know the Kennedy family for many years. In 1949, when I went to the University of Virginia Law School, his brother Bobby was there. I first met TEDDY KENNEDY in conjunction with the things we did in those days at Virginia Law School. We have been very close friends all these ensuing years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I send forth my prayers for his recovery. You know, as Churchill once said in the darkest days of the Battle of Britain: Never, never, never give in. Those are the words that I know to be in TED KENNEDY's mind now. He will take on this challenge. How many times have we been privileged, in this Chamber, to listen to our colleague speak from that back row? He really doesn't need the microphone; his voice resonates to the rafters in this Chamber. That great strength that propels his voice  to reverberate throughout the Senate Chamber will be the same strength that he will draw upon again in his recovery, for which we all pray.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Pennsylvania.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just before entering the Chamber, I heard the devastating news about Senator Kennedy's diagnosis with a malignant brain tumor. I have been there. A few years back, I was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and given 3 to 6 weeks to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note in the press release that it says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How well patients fare depends on what specific tumor type is determined by further testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The diagnosis for me, for a malignant brain tumor, turned out to be incorrect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note Senator Kennedy will be receiving chemotherapy and radiation. I know something about chemotherapy myself. I am in the middle of it right now for Hodgkin's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Senator Kennedy is a real fighter. We all know that. I am betting on Senator Kennedy. He has been such a champion on so many causes--civil rights, health, education, labor reform, and the judiciary, where he served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee with great distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be my hope that what has happened today would provide some motivation for both parties to find a bipartisan way to cross the aisle and to stop the bickering which has characterized the confirmation process for so many years. Senator Kennedy has been an example, a shining example. He has crossed the aisle and sponsored so many legislative enactments. I have had the opportunity to cosponsor the Kennedy-Specter bill, for example, on hate crimes and the civil rights bill that has  been so often cited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said all I had to say about the current matter. I spoke at length yesterday and again today on Justice Agee. There is no doubt he is well qualified--the other two nominees are as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you cite the statistics, you can cite them both ways. You can cite them in all directions. When you talk about fault, it is equal; the blame is on both sides. The conduct of both parties in this Chamber has been disgraceful in the last 20 years--both sides, first one side and then the other, and each time it exacerbates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worked very closely with Senator Leahy over the years, and we have had some real bipartisan agreements. My hope is that he and I can get together again and find a way to solve this partisan morass and to establish a timetable that once a nomination comes in, so many days later, there is a hearing; so many days later, it comes out of committee; and so many days later, it comes to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the middle of the battle over this so-called deal, which I have spoken on at length yesterday and today, the news of what has happened with Senator Kennedy perhaps will give us some motivation to follow Senator Kennedy's lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise principally to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Warner, our senior Senator from Virginia, and to recommend to this body the qualifications of Steven Agee for this position and to emphasize that I believe Senator Warner and I have been able to accomplish some things in the last year and a half that I hope we can sort of spread out in a broader way to the body here. We found the issues on which we can work together in terms of governing  this country in a responsible way. The judicial nominees are one of them. We have worked not only closely together, we worked in the same room, interviewing people who would be potential judges, recommending them jointly to the White House, and supporting them thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I highly recommend this candidate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to take a moment and associate myself with the remarks of others who expressed their concern about Senator Kennedy. He is truly a lion of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incidentally, I wish to also express my profound respect for the senior Senator from Pennsylvania for the way he has addressed his own health challenges over the years and the example he has set for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I say to my distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from Virginia, and my partner, I thank him so much for the way in which, from the moment he has arrived at the Senate, we have worked together on behalf of the interests of our Nation and our State. I think this is a very clear manifestation of how two Senators of different parties can come together and find that candidate they judge to be eminently qualified to serve--not only the State of Virginia but the  other States served by the Fourth Circuit. As we know, circuit court opinions are binding on a wide realm of cases throughout the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Virginia for his participation with me as a full partner in bringing this nomination to the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator. I thank him also for the leadership and example he has set for this body over the 30 years.</paragraph>

  <chair> One and one half minute remains for Senators to speak.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I sat here, discussing with the distinguished ranking member, Senator Specter, health matters. Senator Specter is a longtime friend. He has gone through some terrible health issues. We were discussing that. I will not go further into that because it was a private conversation, except that he knows how much I pray for his well-being and his continued health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say I thank Senator Warner and Senator Durbin and Senator Specter and others for what they said about Senator Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in New England especially feel extraordinarily close to Senator Kennedy. I have known him for more than a third of a century. We have all heard bad news on the Senate floor. This is one of the most difficult things I have heard in my 34 years here. I said to the people in my office, this is one of the worst days I have spent in the Senate, to hear this news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marcella and I will keep not only Senator Kennedy but his wonderful family in our prayers and will continue to pray for a full recovery.</paragraph>
