    <paragraph>Mr. President, nearly a week has passed since the President vetoed a bipartisan proposal that fully funded our troops and also changed course in Iraq so we could responsibly end the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the President's actions thwarted the will of the American people, very clearly, they--the American people--deserve to know what their leaders in Congress are doing. We are alerting them that we, as congressional leaders, are doing everything we can to work toward an agreement on an emergency supplemental funding bill that will make America more secure, fully fund our troops, and responsibly change course in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our proposal called for a change in the mission and the phased redeployment of U.S. combat troops no later than October 1 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bipartisan majority of the House and Senate made it clear they believe a timeline for the reduction of combat operations will compel the Iraqi Government to take responsibility for their own country, will reduce the specter of occupation, and will allow our forces to come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people believe this overwhelmingly. But now there are signs the Republican leadership in Congress is beginning to think a timeline is necessary as well. According to the L.A. Times, House Republican Leader JOHN BOEHNER said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bush risks defections in the fall if the war situation hasn't improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time we get to September or October, members are going to want to know how well this is working,  and if it isn't, what's Plan B.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Republican leader now seems to be saying that he and his colleagues agree there must be a time limit on the President's current course in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is also revealing, and somewhat disturbing, is the Republican leader is willing to allow our troops to stay in Iraq with a failing strategy until he and his colleagues decide it is time to part with the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush--the same President who vetoed our plan--said this as a candidate about his predecessor, Bill Clinton, and the war in Bosnia, in 1999:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's important for the president to lay out a timetable as to how long they will be involved and when they would be withdrawn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope President Bush will keep his own past words in mind as these negotiations continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are pleased to see the House Republican leader, speaking on behalf of his caucus, adopt our view that this commitment in Iraq must not be open-ended, that there must be a timeline. It is surely no coincidence that his views come at a time when conditions in Iraq grow worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of the Easter sermon of Pope Benedict, delivered only a month ago. The Pope said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How many wounds--how much suffering there is in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He continued:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing positive comes from Iraq, torn apart by continual slaughter as the civilian population flees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since those words were spoken, conditions have indeed deteriorated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April, our troops suffered the deadliest month of the year and one of the deadliest of the entire 51 months of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's own Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction released its quarterly report last weekend that painted a dispiriting picture of waste, ineffectiveness, and failure to achieve even minimally satisfactory results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite burning through most of the 20 billion American dollars planned for reconstruction, many Iraqis are without basic necessities such as electricity and clean drinking water. Of course, oil production is down. Only a third of Iraqi children are attending school. Seventy percent of the kids are suffering from symptoms of trauma that could paralyze an entire generation that we are counting on to harvest the seeds of democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki is accused of sabotaging efforts for peace and stability by firing some of the country's top law enforcement officials for doing too good a job of combating violent Shiite militias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush speaks of pressuring the Iraqi people to take responsibility for their own future. Yet while American troops are fighting and dying to secure the country, the Iraqi Government is planning a 2-month summer vacation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, eight more courageous American soldiers fell; four the day before. I have no doubt these developments weighed on Leader Boehner's mind when he made his comments suggesting a fall timeline to the war in Iraq. But I know he is not alone. Many of my Republican friends across the aisle feel strongly that a change of course in our Iraq strategy is needed--one that holds the administration and the Iraqis accountable for real results. Many of my Republican friends across the aisle  feel it is time for change. This is the time. I know many of my Republican friends also intend to be part of the solution on the way forward, and I look forward to working with them. We all look forward to continuing negotiations, which we will work on</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one wants to succeed in Iraq and make America more secure than I.</paragraph>
