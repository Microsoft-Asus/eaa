  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas armed groups have been moving freely among Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic, committing murder, banditry, forced recruitment, mass displacement, gender-based violence, and other crimes that are contributing to insecurity and instability throughout the region, exacerbating the humanitarian crises in these  countries and obstructing efforts to end violence in the Darfur region of Sudan and adjacent areas;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on February 2, 2008, rebels stormed the capital of Chad, N'Djamena, in their second coup attempt in two years, prompting clashes with forces loyal to President of Chad Idriss Deby that caused more than 100 civilian deaths, thousands of displacements, and an estimated 10,000 refugees from Chad to seek refuge in neighboring Cameroon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on February 2, 2008, the United States Embassy in N'Djamena was forced to evacuate employees' families and all nonemergency staff and urged United States citizens to defer all travel to Chad;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on February 2, 2008, the United States Government condemned the armed attack on N'Djamena and expressed "support [for] the [African Union]'s call for an immediate end to armed attacks and to refrain from violence that might harm innocent civilians";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on February 12, 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that recent offensives by the Government of Sudan in Darfur have prompted up to 12,000 new refugees to flee to neighboring Chad, where the UNHCR and its partners are already struggling to take care of 240,000 refugees from Sudan in eastern Chad and some 50,000 refugees from the Central African Republic in southern Chad;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas cross-border attacks by alleged Arab militias from Sudan and related inter-communal ethnic hostilities in eastern Chad have also resulted in the displacement of an estimated 170,000 people from Chad in the region, adding to the humanitarian need;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there have been allegations and evidence in both Chad and Sudan of government support for dissident rebel militias in each other's country, in direct violation of the Tripoli Declaration of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, 2006;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on January 16, 2008, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for the Central African Republic reported that waves of violence across the north of that country have left more than 1,000,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 150,000 who are internally displaced, while some 80,000 have fled to neighboring Chad or Cameroon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, since late 2007, arrests, disappearances, and harassment of journalists, human rights defenders, and opposition leaders--particularly those reporting on military operations and human rights conditions in eastern Chad--mirror the repressive crackdown in the aftermath of an attack on N'Djamena in April 2006, and conditions have only worsened since the February 2008 attempted coup;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on September 27, 2007, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), authorizing a limited United Nations peacekeeping mission (MINURCAT) and a concurrent European-led force (EUFOR), which is permitted to "take all necessary measures" to protect refugees, civilians, and aid workers in eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, despite the explicit support of President Deby, deployment of both the 3,700 EUFOR troops and the 350 MINURCAT officers has been hampered by political and security delays as well as insufficient resources; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas continuing hostilities will undermine efforts to bring security to Sudan's Darfur region, dangerously destabilize volatile political and humanitarian situations in Chad and the Central African Republic, and potentially disrupt progress towards peace in southern Sudan: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) expresses the concern and compassion of the citizens of the United States for the hundreds of thousands of citizens of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic who have been gravely affected by this interrelated violence and instability;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) calls upon all parties to these conflicts to cease hostilities immediately and uphold basic human rights;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) urges the governments of Chad and Sudan, with support from other key regional and international stakeholders, including France, Libya, and China, to commit to another round of inclusive negotiations towards a sustainable political solution for national and regional stability facilitated and monitored by impartial third-party leadership;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) calls upon the governments of Chad and Sudan to reaffirm their commitment to the Tripoli Declaration of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, 2006, refrain from any actions that violate these agreements, and cease all logistical, financial, and military support to insurgent groups;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) urges the Government of Chad to increase political participation, strengthen democratic institutions, respect human rights, improve accountability and transparency as well as the provision of basic services, and uphold its commitment to protect its own citizens in order to redeem the legitimacy of the Government in the eyes of its citizens and the international community;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) calls for diplomatic and material support from the United States and the international community to facilitate, implement, and monitor a comprehensive peace process that includes an inclusive dialogue with all relevant stakeholders to end violence, demobilize militias, and promote return and reconstruction for internally displaced persons and refugees; and</chair>
  <chair> (7) encourages the United States Government and the international community to provide immediate and ongoing support for the multilateral peacekeeping missions in Darfur, eastern Chad, and the northern Central African Republic, along with adequate assistance to meet the continuing humanitarian and security needs of the individuals and areas most affected by these interrelated conflicts.&lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</chair>
