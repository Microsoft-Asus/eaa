  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of the Armenian Turkish newspaper editor, Hrant Dink. On January 19, the legacy of the Armenian genocide continued. Hrant Dink, who was tried and convicted of "insulting Turkishness" by recognizing the Armenian genocide, unfortunately, was shot dead over a week ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dink was a voice for freedom of the press, for democracy and for Armenian genocide recognition. Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire led a genocide on its Armenian population, killing over 1.5 million people. Over 90 years later, the Turkish Government still refuses to acknowledge it occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told the Turkish foreign minister last year that to move forward with democratic reform, Turkey must first comes to grips with its past, just as our country had during the civil rights movement. Yesterday, I sent a letter to President Bush urging the withdrawal of the nomination of Richard Hoagland to be Ambassador to Armenia. Given the assassination of Dink, we cannot have an ambassador who refuses to acknowledge the Armenian genocide happened. It would send the wrong message.</paragraph>
