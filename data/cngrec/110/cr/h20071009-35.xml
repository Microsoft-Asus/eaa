  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that we come to the floor tonight to honor the memory of our colleague and friend, the Honorable Jo Ann Davis, who lost her 2-year battle with breast cancer this past Saturday. She was not only our House colleague; she was our Virginia colleague who represented the First District of Virginia, a district which she proudly called "America's First District" because of our country's roots at Jamestown and the many significant events in history which  occurred there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann Davis also could have had a first next to her name because she was the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Virginia in 2000 to succeed our late colleague Herb Bateman. But that historic aspect of her career in Congress was not important to her. Representing her constituents and being the best Member of Congress she could be for the people of her district, that was what was most important to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her career in elected office spanned 10 short years, from her first election in 1997 to the Virginia House of Delegates to her four elected terms in the House beginning in the year 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But over that decade she made her mark as a deeply caring and very hardworking public servant who believed in common sense and conservative ideals. In remembering Jo Ann's work in Congress, there are several thoughts I would like to share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She battled to the end with courage and grace in her fight against breast cancer. When she was first diagnosed in 2005 with the insidious disease, she announced it publicly to encourage other women to beware of the disease. Her bravery and personal strength were a source of inspiration to many. She was a person of honesty, integrity, and very strong moral conviction in representing her district and living her life. And she had a very strong commitment to the Lord. She was a dedicated and tenacious  fighter for her beliefs, and the importance of her faith was obvious in the way she cared for and treated others and in the way she did her job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a tireless and passionate advocate for the First District in Virginia, working to protect the military interests in her district and Navy shipbuilding in Newport News. She cofounded the Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus as she worked to provide for the defense of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as important as that work was for Jo Ann, protecting the interests of men and women in uniform, their families, and veterans was priority number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She also worked hard for other local interests, such as the removal of the "ghost fleet" of obsolete, environmentally hazardous ships from the James River; better regulation of the amount of trash coming into Virginia; and protecting the resources of the Chesapeake Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House and this Nation will miss Jo Ann Davis and her dedication to public service. I want to express my sincere condolences to her staff, both in Washington and in her district, who can be proud of their work by her side for the people of America's First District. Jo Ann Davis had an outstanding staff, and I want to thank the staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to join with my colleagues in expressing profound sympathy to Jo Ann's husband, Chuck; and their two sons, Christopher and Charles; and a granddaughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In remembering Jo Ann Davis and her life of service to others, I am reminded of the words of Scripture where it says: "Well done, good and faithful servant."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a news article and editorial from the Newport News Daily Press about our late colleague, the Honorable Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The Unlikely Politician--The Self-Described Country Gal Preferred Horses to the Capitol Hill Party Circuit</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By David Lerman)</narrative>
  <narrative>She was, by her own admission, an unlikely politician.</narrative>
  <narrative>Virginia Rep. Jo Ann Davis, who died of breast cancer Saturday at age 57, was more at ease with her beloved horses on her Gloucester farm than the cocktail party circuit on Capitol Hill.</narrative>
  <narrative>The self-described country gal and former real estate agent fell into a congressional career almost by accident. It took church connections, perseverance and the sudden withdrawal of the leading Republican Party favorite to propel Davis to the office she first won in 2000.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I could have cared less about politics," she recalled in a 2003 interview. "I did not know there was a Republican Party committee in Virginia."</narrative>
  <narrative>But since becoming Virginia's first female Republican member of Congress, Davis learned her role quickly and, many agreed, managed to make the 1st District House seat her own:</narrative>
  <narrative>When obsolete, environmentally hazardous ships started mushrooming in the James River off Fort Eustis, Davis fought for federal funding to speed up their removal--and made significant progress.</narrative>
  <narrative>When state and local officials complained about the barrage of trash coming into Virginia landfills from other states and littering state highways, Davis pushed for legislation to limit interstate waste.</narrative>
  <narrative>While that effort stalled, she won approval of a measure establishing a series of random safety inspections for waste haulers.</narrative>
  <narrative>When military personnel and federal employees complained of inadequate benefits, Davis won passage of legislation increasing the life insurance benefits paid to survivors of military members killed on duty.</narrative>
  <narrative>And when Pentagon budgets forecast a steady decline in the size of the Navy's fleet, Davis sounded the alarm.</narrative>
  <narrative>A staunch advocate for the thousands of shipyard workers in her district, she co-founded the Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus and pushed legislation, albeit unsuccessfully, mandating a larger fleet.</narrative>
  <narrative>"At a time when people have such a negative impression of Washington, Jo Ann Davis was a refreshing reminder that there are people here who do their best for their constituents," said Christopher Connelly, her chief of staff.</narrative>
  <narrative>"A lot of the issues she worked on were local issues. She didn't get lost in the Washington glamour."</narrative>
  <narrative>While seldom a major player on national policy matters, Davis won respect from Republicans and Democrats alike for her ability to delve into local concerns and to stay true to her beliefs.</narrative>
  <narrative>"While we had different political loyalties, we had no differences in our efforts to work together for the Hampton Roads area," said Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott, D-Newport News.</narrative>
  <narrative>Davis" rise to political power was as unconventional as it was unlikely.</narrative>
  <narrative>Unlike her predecessor in office, the late Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, Davis lacked the traditional credentials and years of political grooming that typically foreshadow a congressional career.</narrative>
  <narrative>No prestigious university or law-school degree appeared on her resume.</narrative>
  <narrative>The daughter of a Hampton city bus driver, Davis came from modest roots that stood in contrast to those of many of her wealthier colleagues in Congress.</narrative>
  <narrative>After graduating from Hampton Roads Business College in 1971, she went to work as an executive secretary for a real estate firm before becoming a stay-at-home mom.</narrative>
  <narrative>She later got her real estate license and opened Davis Management Co. in 1988, followed by Jo Ann Davis Realty in 1990.</narrative>
  <narrative>All the while, Davis was becoming a deeply religious person.</narrative>
  <narrative>When her mother-in-law suffered a fatal heart attack, Davis has said, she had a born-again experience and then joined the Assembly of God church.</narrative>
  <narrative>Through her church, Davis met Brenda Pogge, a fellow real estate agent and local GOP activist, who encouraged her to enter politics and invited her to her first Republican mass meeting.</narrative>
  <narrative>"She was my sister in the faith," Pogge said. "She was my friend, my boss and then my congresswoman. Jo Ann was such a role model."</narrative>
  <narrative>In 1997, at Pogge's steady urging, Davis reluctantly agreed to challenge a 15-year Democratic incumbent in the General Assembly and won, despite being outspent roughly 3 to 1.</narrative>
  <narrative>In 2000, when Bateman announced his retirement and then died in office, Davis launched her upstart campaign for Congress.</narrative>
  <narrative>The odds seemed stacked against her because of formidable opposition for the Republican nomination, led by former Newport News Mayor Barry DuVal.</narrative>
  <narrative>But when DuVal withdrew from the race, Davis had an opening. She faced a grueling five-way party primary but emerged victorious with 35 percent of the vote.</narrative>
  <narrative>Her general election victory was then little in doubt because of the 1st District's strong Republican tilt. She easily won re-election repeatedly, as she did last year.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because of her faith, Davis has said, she remained an outspoken conservative voice on social issues.</narrative>
  <narrative>She co-sponsored a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and took a purist position on abortion, opposing it even in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is endangered.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's just who I am," she once said. "I believe what I believe. I didn't know I was called a right-winger."</narrative>
  <narrative>If there was a historic aspect to Davis' career, it was in her becoming the first Republican woman to win a House seat from Virginia. Former Rep. Leslie Byrne of Fairfax was the first Democratic woman.</narrative>
  <narrative>But Davis bristled at such gender-based distinctions, which she regarded as irrelevant. "It shouldn't matter if you're male or female," she once said. "I'm just a member of Congress, like they are.</narrative>
  <narrative>"No different."</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>

  <narrative>Jo Ann Davis--A CAREER SPENT MAKING FRIENDS, WORKING HARD AND DOING HER DUTY</narrative>
  <narrative>Rep. Jo Ann Davis died on Saturday as the new edition of Time magazine appeared in mailboxes around Hampton Roads. "Breast Cancer is Spreading Around the World," the cover headline read.</narrative>
  <narrative>Cancer. The scourge of our times. And it has run up a wretched score in the 1st Congressional District. Davis' predecessor, Rep. Herbert Bateman, fought lung cancer and prostate cancer before succumbing in 2000.</narrative>
  <narrative>Davis confronted her illness bravely and with little regard for the odds, just as she had approached politics.</narrative>
  <narrative>Del. Shirley Cooper, the redoubtable Democrat from York County, held her seat in the General Assembly for 15 years until an outspent Davis came along in 1997 and snatched it away from her. That was an impressive win.</narrative>
  <narrative>Three years later, Davis went one better. The 1st District congressional seat, open after Bateman's death, drew five contenders for the Republican nomination, including one who self-financed his bid to the tune of $l million.</narrative>
  <narrative>For her part, Davis amassed around $45,000 and won handily. Now, that tells you something.</narrative>
  <narrative>Davis enjoyed a l0-year political career, a brief span in relative terms, but memorable for what it lacked. "Jo Ann knew no enemies," Brenda Pogge said, in an interview on Sunday. "She was just emotionally and spiritually strong."</narrative>
  <narrative>Democrats also said as much. Not long after Davis arrived in Washington, Rep. Bobby Scott started quietly telling people that he admired Davis for her independence and readiness to do the work. There was nothing flashy, no attention-gathering histrionics so common to the profession, just diligence and commitment.</narrative>
  <narrative>And empathy. The 1st District naturally draws its representatives into military affairs, including such arcane matters such as defense contracting and Pentagon appropriations. But for Davis the military was first and fundamentally about people--the soldiers, the families, the veterans--and what had to be done to provide for their interests.</narrative>
  <narrative>There's a legacy there. Something to admire. Something, perhaps, to emulate as the inevitable scrambling develops to fill the 1st District seat. You can, as Jo Ann Davis amply demonstrated, succeed in politics by making friends, working hard and doing your duty.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in mourning the loss of one of the Commonwealth of Virginia's finest public servants, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis. She was a good friend and a tireless advocate for America's First District, as both she and the late Congressman Herb Bateman referred to the First Congressional District of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann was a self-made woman who came from modest roots. Born in North Carolina, she grew up in Hampton, Virginia, where her father was a city bus driver. She graduated from Hampton Roads Business College in 1971, received her real estate license in 1984, and received her real estate broker's license 4 years later. She was a successful business woman, having opened Davis Management Company in 1988 and Jo Ann Davis Realty in 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Jo Ann was not a career politician and probably never imagined that she would run for office and end up serving in the United States Congress for over 6 years. In 1997 she was reluctantly convinced by her friends to run for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. When our late colleague Herb Bateman announced his retirement from the House, Jo Ann mounted an underdog campaign. Notwithstanding the fact that she was outspent by a margin of 40 to one in the primary,  she prevailed; and in November, 2000, she became the first Republican woman from Virginia elected to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we had different political loyalties, we had no differences in our efforts to work together for the citizens of Hampton Roads. Jo Ann's service on the Armed Services Committee directly mirrored her commitment to the thousands of military personnel in her district. One of her first pieces of legislation that she introduced passed in 2001. It increased the amount of life insurance benefits for survivors of members of the U.S. Armed Forces killed in active duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann was also a tireless advocate for the thousands of shipbuilders in her district that worked at Northrop Grumman Newport News, and she cofounded the Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus with Congressman Gene Taylor of Mississippi. That caucus has made a compelling case to the Department of Defense that it is pivotal for our national defense that the Navy spend more money on shipbuilding. In the last Congress, she was instrumental in efforts to secure funding for the refueling  of the USS Carl Vinson. Without Jo Ann's hard work, the Hampton Roads area might have lost billions of dollars in economic revenue tied directly to that aircraft carrier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann placed a high priority on the removal of ships in the so-called James River "Ghost Fleet," which posed a major environmental threat to the James River and the Chesapeake Bay; and as a result of her leadership, many of those ships have been removed. Together, we have worked to secure Federal funding for the Achievable Dream education program in Newport News to ensure that at-risk children have the best opportunity to succeed in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body was saddened to learn that Jo  Ann developed breast cancer in 2005 and even more so when the cancer returned this year. The sadness is especially felt by members of the weekly Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which Jo Ann and I regularly attended. Despite her personal battle with cancer, Jo Ann did not retire from Congress. She stayed and fought her cancer and continued to represent the  people of the First District to the best of her ability until the very end. Learning from her own experience with cancer, she has encouraged her colleagues and her constituents to get screened regularly for all types of cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Hampton Roads delegation has lost a tremendous advocate for the interests of our region. I want to extend my deepest sympathies to her husband of 33 years, Chuck Davis; their two grown sons, Charlie and Christopher; their granddaughter; and her wonderful staff with whom my staff has worked so well over the years. America's First District and the U.S. House of Representatives have lost a true friend and advocate with the passing of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Jo Ann Davis, who has served this body with dignity and honor and dedication since her election in 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met Jo Ann when she was running for the House of Delegates in 1997 and quickly became impressed with her strong work ethic. Her congressional district, like mine, is the home of many current and retired Federal employees. So when I became chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, it was an easy decision to ask her to oversee the Civil Service Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She took on the responsibilities of subcommittee Chair with great diligence and energy. Through her efforts, we made important strides in helping the Federal Government recruit and retain quality employees. With her help, we improved Federal student loan repayment programs and expanded dental and vision benefits. Jo Ann was a strong supporter of legislation allowing retired Federal employees to deduct health care premiums from pretax dollars, moving this important legislation through  her subcommittee. She was also a reliable ally in the annual fight for pay parity for civilian Federal employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her district borders mine; we both represent portions of Prince William County. We have worked closely on a number of local issues. With her passing, Northern Virginia and the Commonwealth have lost a strong advocate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute Jo Ann Davis for her courageous fight against cancer. Her passing reminds us all that we need to fight this horrible affliction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heartfelt condolences go out to her husband, Chuck and to her sons, Christopher and Charles. I hope they find solace in knowing she did so much to represent the people of Virginia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri, the chairman of one of the committees that Jo Ann served on and a past president of the weekly Congressional Prayer Breakfast (Mr. Skelton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for giving me the opportunity to express my condolences to the Jo Ann Davis family, her husband and two sons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's always difficult to say good-bye to a friend. And Jo Ann Davis was my friend. She was my colleague. We served together on the Armed Services Committee since she came to Congress. She represented the First District of Virginia, which had and has a strong military tradition. She was preceded in this Congress by my friend through the years Herb Bateman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a strong advocate for the men and women in uniform, and she will be sorely missed in supporting them as the days lie ahead. Shipbuilding was the centerpiece of her work because of the district she represented, and she understood and advocated the importance of shipbuilding for the United States Navy. She was a member, actually a subcommittee ranking member, on the Readiness Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And it is interesting that we should, this evening, point out that she fought a disease with grace and dignity, and that this is the Breast Cancer Awareness month, that I think we should make note of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She fought a tremendous fight. She came back when she could, and our heart was with her. She fought the good fight. But in looking back at my friend, Jo Ann Davis, I remember her most for her sense of humor, how we would joke with one another and how absolutely pleasant she was. Those are attributes that people remember just as much as they remember the good work that she did as a Member of this body. So I thank the gentleman from Virginia for allowing me to say a word or two about my  friend, Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time to the gentlewoman from Virginia, Thelma Drake.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our colleague and my friend, Jo Ann Davis. I was honored to have served with her in both the Virginia General Assembly and now here in the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann and I had reverse roles. When Jo Ann ran for the House of Delegates, I was her mentor. I was glad to see her success at being elected there. And when I ran for the U.S. Congress in 2004, Jo Ann was my mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were both Realtors and shared that common bond and that friendship. I was proud to support her in her historic elevation to the Congress. Jo Ann, as you have heard, was the first Republican woman to serve in this body. She was also the first woman from Virginia to be re-elected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that Jo Ann was a woman of great faith, great strength, great courage, great honesty and great integrity. I don't believe that it was ever Jo Ann's intention to be a trailblazer. I think her successes in her life as a mother, a grandmother, a businesswoman, as a legislator are all the result of a path that she chose in her life, and that was the path that cared for other people first, put other people first, and that she stood very strong on the principles to protect  those around her. That earned her the respect of the people of the First District, and it lead her on the path to the House of Delegates and then here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann was a valued resource and a trusted confidant. Here in Congress, I was honored to work with her on issues facing the people of Hampton Roads and of Virginia. We served together on the House Armed Services Committee, and I have watched her very deep appreciation for the contributions of the shipbuilding industry, and she understood the important role that the Navy plays in our Nation, projecting strength and security around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann also was a true leader and a hero in protecting our military and their families, and she always worked to ensure that their rights and interests were protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that the month of October is dedicated to raising breast cancer awareness. For even as Jo Ann battled her own illness, she saw her illness as an opportunity to help other women. When she was first diagnosed, she told me that she would be healed, and she was, from her first bout of cancer, and that she would use this as an opportunity for other women to see and to make sure that other women received the health care and didn't put things off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that today I join my colleagues in extending our deepest sympathies to her family, to her husband Chuck, to her staff, to her friends. I appreciate the opportunity to stand here and to honor my good friend. I know that we will all miss her greatly.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlelady from California (Mrs. Capps).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I, with great sadness, rise to pay tribute as well to our dear colleague, Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As other women in the Congress know, there is a sisterhood among many women Members. This weekend, we lost one of our sisters to a disease that has fostered another kind of sisterhood throughout the Nation, breast cancer. And while Jo Ann would have chosen to confront her disease in private, she bravely and valiantly decided  to take her experience to improve the experiences of other women in that sisterhood. She did so by advocating for the  Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act and other legislation that would improve the lives of those who suffer from this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also proud to work with Jo Ann on the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act. Together we worked, one from the west coast and one from the east, to extend to Federal firefighters the same presumptive disability rights offered to most city and State firefighters. I enjoyed working with Jo Ann on this issue, especially as she showed so much her dedication to firefighters and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will, however, most fondly remember the many mornings I and several others spent with Jo Ann at prayer breakfast on Wednesday mornings at the C Street House, as we will gather in sadness and sorrow tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were bound together, several of us, through personal experiences with cancer. And when amongst our fellowship Jo Ann was first diagnosed, we supported her with prayer; and then as she regained her strength, we rejoiced. But as so often and tragically happens with this dreaded disease and others, there was a relapse. And we have been much in prayer, as all of us have, for her recovery, but it was not to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, she and I had our differences in the direction of policy, but we certainly shared in our desire to let our faith serve as a guide for our work in Congress. And she was a very strong, principled person whose convictions and certainty of her faith shown through everything that she did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know we're going to honor our dear departed colleague by following in her strong example, by calling on our faith to serve as the motivation for our work here in Congress the way that she did. We may not measure up to her strength, but we have a role model in her. And I also hope that we, as a Congress, will serve to honor her memory by redoubling our efforts to remove the scourge of cancer through support for prevention, for following her example of reaching out, through education outreach  and awareness, and for increasing research dollars so that we can more effectively prevent and treat this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues in paying tribute to Jo Ann Davis today and offering our condolences to her family, her staff and her constituents in this time of their sorrow. We will miss Jo Ann Davis dearly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I, like so many others, rise today to pay tribute to Jo Ann Davis and to offer my sympathies to her husband, Chuck, and her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By now, you begin to hear a pattern that reflects very accurately the life of Jo Ann. And you hear many people stand up and saying the same thing, that she was our friend, and like so many others, we will miss her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spent a lot of hours talking with Jo Ann in this corner and in the Armed Services Committee, and I remember reading one account in one of the papers that said that she was born of "modest" means. But if you listened to Jo Ann, she was born poor. Jo Ann never went to a 4-year college, but she had more wisdom than you could ever see reflected in a diploma, and one mistake you could never, ever make with Jo Ann Davis was to underestimate her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I still remember how she used to talk that so many people felt that she could never put herself through real estate school, and she proved them wrong. I remember her talking about how, that as a wife and mother, many people didn't feel that she could become a successful Realtor, and she proved them wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when she was first running for the House of Delegates meeting with her and talking with her and she told me that people didn't think she could win, and she proved them wrong. And then, like my good friend from Virginia, Congressman Scott, said, when she was running for Congress, she was a 40-1 financial underdog and nobody thought she could win, and she proved them wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who would have ever thought she would have served on the Armed Services Committee, been the ranking member of one of the subcommittees, that she would serve on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives, and as so many people mentioned, she became a national leader on shipbuilding and defending the shipbuilding trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a tireless advocate for our veterans and men and women in uniform. She loved her husband, Chuck, and firefighters and would stand with firefighters in almost every issue that they brought forward, both in the Virginia House of Delegates when she served there and here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She loved her family, and she was proud of them. And she loved her constituents, and she fought for them. And nobody, and I emphasize "nobody," ever told her what to do. She always did what she thought was right for Virginia, and what she thought was right for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And two final things that I think you don't hear people reflect here today, but we need to just mention, she loved horses. And I remember her and I talking many times about the fact that we were probably two of the only Members of Congress that actually had to go home on weekends and clean out horse stables; and yet Jo Ann was the kind of person that was humble enough not only to do it, but to love it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But above everything else, I am absolutely convinced that she would also want us to say today, and this is what Congressman Wolf alluded to a little bit earlier, that she absolutely loved, above anything else in her life, her faith in Jesus Christ. And I have no question that today she has heard those words that Congressman Wolf mentioned, and that is, "Well done, good and faithful servant."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to acknowledge the passing of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis and to pay tribute to her. As we all know, she passed away on Saturday. And although she had been diagnosed a while ago, we knew she was sick, it still hit this Congress very hard to lose her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Davis was tremendously proud to represent Virginia's First District, which she called "America's First District" because it included Jamestown. She spoke often on this floor of the deep patriotism of her constituents and of the pride of the many brave men and women in uniform who were her constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Jo Ann Davis was elected to Congress, as has been mentioned by some, she made history as the first female Republican ever elected to the House from Virginia; but she knew it was far more critical to make progress than to make history, and she did, particularly in honoring our troops and our veterans. In fact, the first piece of legislation Congresswoman Davis ever introduced increased the life insurance benefits paid to survivors of military members killed on duty, and  that passed the House in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, Congresswoman Davis became an outspoken advocate in favor of education, prevention and treatment of the disease. We in this body can express our admiration for her dedication with a real national commitment to fighting this disease which annually takes the lives of 40,000 American women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Daily Press of Newport News, Virginia wrote of their Member of Congress this weekend, "You can, as Jo Ann Davis amply demonstrated, succeed in politics by making friends, working hard, and doing your duty." All of us in this body can honor Congresswoman Davis's legacy by doing just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As was mentioned about the patriotism of her district, she was deeply patriotic as well. She loved our country, and this Congress loved her. When she was diagnosed, we all hovered over her and prayed for her and were deeply saddened. At first, she would be gone for a while, and when she came back, we all encircled her and hugged her, and as it turned out, drew strength from her. As we were trying to encourage her, she gave us strength. Her attitude, her dignity, and the strength with which she  confronted this terrible disease was something that was a lesson for all of us. When she passed away, we were all very, very deeply saddened, as I mentioned before, to get that sad news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was really a bright light in this Congress. I hope it is a comfort to her  husband, Chuck Davis, to her family, her two sons, her granddaughter, and her many family and friends that so many people in our country, indeed, intensely in this Congress, mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the great privileges in the daily honor of being able to serve in the Congress of the United States is the privilege of being able to meet extraordinary people on a constant basis here in these Halls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to remember and pay tribute to a dear friend who was one of those truly extraordinary people whom I have had the privilege of meeting in my 15 years here in these Halls of Congress, Jo Ann Davis. We will always remember her not only as the gracious and dignified and wonderful lady that she was, but as the effective representative for her constituents and the great American patriot, who every day gave her all to defend our Nation and to honor and protect, to  the best of her ability, those who protect us and our freedom, our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply comforted, Mr. Speaker, by the fact that Jo Ann Davis had such a profound faith in God. It was her strength. At this time, it is especially comforting to know that she is now with the Lord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I enjoyed my conversations with Jo Ann, the fellowship, her sense of humor. She was a wonderful, wonderful human being. How her eyes would light up, Mr. Speaker, when the subject of her granddaughter would be brought up, Charlotte. I had the privilege of getting to know her son, Charlie, very well. He was a member of my staff, an extraordinary young man, who did his job day in and day out. Each day he worked in our office in a marvelous manner with total devotion to this Congress, to  the people of the United States. I am deeply grateful for his service. I extend to him, my friend, Charlie, and his family, obviously his wife, his daughter, Charlotte, his brother, Jo Ann's other son, Chris, and of course, Chuck, Jo Ann's husband, my deepest sympathy and condolences at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will never forget her, that wonderful, wonderful colleague, that wonderful friend, that wonderful lady who not only graced these Halls but served her constituents of the First District of Virginia so effectively, so well, and indeed served all of America so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I say, I will never forget her and consider it a great privilege to have been able to meet and to be a friend of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I learned of the loss of our colleague and four-term Representative, Jo Ann Davis, who represented Virginia's First District, referred to as America's First District. She was a great leader and a tireless advocate for all of her constituents. And for those of us who came in after her, I remember she organized a WeightWatchers class, saw that we were there every week, and that we followed the procedure for weight watching. She said,  Now, be sure to weigh yourself so that you can see what kind of progress you are making. But I want you to know, I don't weigh myself because I don't think I am progressing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann was first in many ways. As the first elected female Republican from the Commonwealth, she set an example for women across the country who aspire to political office. She worked tirelessly on behalf of our men and women in uniform and the many Federal civil servants in her congressional district and succeeded in introducing and passing legislation that benefited these important constituencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that we lost our colleague to breast cancer. I remember going over to her when we heard that Juanita Millender-McDonald was taking a leave, and the women's caucus wanted to send greetings, and I asked her if she would be the first. She looked at me and she said, No, because on that day, Friday, I take my chemo and I am very sick afterwards. So I said, Well, I understand. I just thought the two of you had much in common and that you could inspire her. We know that it is such a devastating  disease that takes away our loved ones too quickly. I don't know at the time if it was in Jo Ann's mind, but she never let on. She seemed to be very secretive about her personal self.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, as a reminder, this is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and I think it is so appropriate that we salute her and her life because she lived so well and influenced so many people and was really a symbol for how to deal with the condition that she had and she was challenged by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague will be sorely missed, not only here, but in her home district where her constituents knew that she represented them with excellence, integrity, and tenacity. We all mourn her loss, our friend and colleague. I send my most heartfelt condolences to her family, staff, and her many close friends here on Capitol Hill and in Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, I too rise with a very heavy heart today as we mourn the passing and reflect on the life of our dear friend and colleague, Jo Ann Davis. In life, Jo Ann amazed so many of us with her determination and her fighting spirit. In politics, as has been noted before, she made history, becoming the first Republican woman from Virginia to serve in this House. In fighting for everything she believed in up until the last day of her bout with cancer,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As was indicated by my colleagues before, Jo Ann was a true patriot. And though she spent only a mere 10 years in elected office, she left a profound imprint on national and State politics. The State of Virginia and our country will miss her greatly. All of us talk about the experiences and recall with much sadness, but yet appreciation, that we did have the time we did with Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, like many of my Virginia colleagues, served with Jo Ann in the Virginia legislature. I had 3 years with Jo Ann. We served together on the General Laws Committee in the Virginia House of Delegates. It was there that I first saw this incredibly strong woman with a will to make sure that she did the right thing regardless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had adjoining districts. We shared many of the same community interests. Jo Ann was a believer and a promoter of the James River. As was noted earlier by my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Scott), she cared greatly about the Ghost Fleet there as well as making sure that Virginia was no longer a dumping ground for out-of-state trash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been noted, Jo Ann was a great person of faith. I had the tremendous fortune of visiting the Land of Israel with Jo Ann and Chuck and saw firsthand how much her faith meant to her. Regardless of what you say about Jo Ann Davis, I think we can all agree that Jo Ann Davis was never concerned about being politically correct. She carried the bill to make sure that we recognized the holiday of Christmas and that the issue of faith and God was not taken out  of the public realm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann spoke her mind when she had opinions about this war in Iraq. When it came down to it, she cared about her troops, her constituents, her family, and her God. We all will miss Jo Ann tremendously. I want to, at this time, also extend to her family, to Chuck, to her two sons, her granddaughter, a great deal of sympathy. We will miss her.</paragraph>
