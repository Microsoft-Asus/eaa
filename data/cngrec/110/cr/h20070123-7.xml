  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I find it somewhat amusing listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fulminating against the notion that we would allow Delegates to participate in our deliberations of the Committee of the Whole. Obviously the people either haven't read the proposal, or they don't care about what the content is, because these are duly elected representatives that we are proposing to be able to enter into efforts only under operation as Committee of the Whole. While  they are signaling their intent, how they would vote, that if at any point they provide the margin that would change the outcome, we provided for a revote. So we are protecting the integrity of the House, it is just when we are operating in the Committee of the Whole, and it is to give voice, for example, to the Republican Delegate from Puerto Rico who represents 4 million people who do pay taxes, who</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until that day comes, this represents a reasonable compromise to give voice to the men and women who are Delegates, who play an important role, including Puerto Rico, a Republican Delegate, and ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who represents American citizens disenfranchised in the District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today on a somewhat lighter note. While we are dealing with affairs of state, we are going to hear partisan bickering back and forth. We are going to be dealing with major issues or war and peace and global warming. We also have an opportunity this week to reinstitute a tradition that continues to unify and uplift Congress, and I am speaking about bike-partisanship. The last 15 years have signaled a renaissance in cycling--the feats of Greg LaMond and Lance Armstrong  in the Tour de France; Americans using over a hundred million bicycles around the country; the landmark ISTEA legislation reauthorizing the Surface Transportation Act that since 1991 has directed $8 billion to biking and walking and trail activities, $4.5 billion in the last bill alone, another record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working for ways to enhance the status of people who burn calories, not oil, people who take up less space on congested roadways, do not contribute to air pollution, and simplify the parking problems faced by more Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not just better for the cyclists, but it is better for the motorists who don't have the cyclists competing with them. It is better for the health of Americans. We know that we are dealing with an issue of obesity in America, a lack of exercise. Think right now how many Americans are stuck in traffic on their way to ride an exercise bike at a health club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, by enlisting friends on both sides of the aisle to rejoin the Congressional Bicycle Caucus. I strongly urge that my colleagues respond to the invitation that is going out today along with my co-chairman, Tom Petri, a great member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, to join with us. Last session we had over 160 bike-partisan members from both parties who dealt with issues of transportation. We have done activities that involve members  and staff and family. We urge fellow members to sign up now to be ready for the hundreds of cyclists that will join us for the annual Bicycle Summit in March. This is one activity that brings us together that all people can benefit from, and they will be entitled to their membership pin in the Congressional Bicycle Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge that we take these steps for a healthier America, for an environmentally sensitive America, for an America where children can get to school safely on their own, and that we are able to live a little lighter on the land.</paragraph>
