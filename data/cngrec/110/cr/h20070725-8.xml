  <narrative>INVITE ILLEGALS TO NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8402]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, New Haven, Connecticut, has become exactly that: a new haven for illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city will be granting illegals an ID card that will allow them to access city services, such as parks, the library, and the ability to open bank accounts. This ID card for illegals will become the first of its kind in our Nation issued by a city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though the American public is opposed to free-pass amnesty, this city doesn't understand it is still against the law to be in the United States illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But New Haven doesn't seem to care. They have already recruited banks that will allow use of these cards. Yale Law School volunteered free legal services. All in the name of helping people get away with breaking the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Haven, Connecticut, flaunts its encouragement of illegal entry. So since the Feds won't adequately enforce immigration laws and don't seem to know what to do with illegals, let's just invite all illegals to go to New Haven, Connecticut, where the city wants to have a safe sanctuary for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there should be consequences for cities like New Haven, Connecticut, that are bastions for illegals. Cities that openly promote violations of Federal law should lose Federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
