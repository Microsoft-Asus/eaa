    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that on February 28, I was unable to vote on certain provisions of <bill type="s" number="4">S.4</bill>, the Improving America's Security Act of 2007. I wish to address these votes so that the people of the great State of Kansas, who elected me to serve them as U.S. Senator, may know my position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding vote No. 54, on the Inouye amendment No. 285, I would not have voted in favor of this amendment. My vote would not have altered the result of the final vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding vote No. 55, on the DeMint amendment No. 279 as modified, I would have voted in favor of this amendment. My vote would not have altered the result of the final vote.</paragraph>
