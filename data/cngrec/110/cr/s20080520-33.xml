    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to send Senator TED KENNEDY and Vicki and all the family my very best wishes. I am confident that with the fighting spirit that embodies who TED KENNEDY is, we will soon see him back here in this Chamber of the Senate. Over the years, as I have worked closely with Senator Kennedy on a number of different measures, I have seen his passion and ethic of service here on the floor. Over the many years I knew about</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the reason I know he will be back here working with all of us is because we have often talked about some of the difficult challenges he has faced in life. We have talked about the plane crash and how it was that he was pulled from the wreckage. While many did not expect him to survive, he did, and he has gone on to provide another 40 years of service to this great Nation and this world. It is that fighting spirit that, again, will take Senator Kennedy in a very positive way forward  to continue to serve this Nation, the State of Massachusetts, and the entire world. That ethic of service in many ways is what guides most of us who are here, but certainly it is the roots of Senator TED KENNEDY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have often talked about his relationship with the United Farm Workers of America. In the prayer which the founder of the United Farm Workers of American, Cesar Chavez, wrote, I find a lot of that prayer reflected in Senator Kennedy. I thought I would essentially read a part of that prayer. I think it is so true of Senator KENNEDY, the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, and so many others who get so much inspiration from this wonderful man, TED  KENNEDY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prayer is as follows, in part:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was written by Cesar Chavez, born in 1927, passed away in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For TED KENNEDY, the closing part of that prayer, "so we can change the world," I will say this to Senator Kennedy tonight from the floor of the Senate: We still have a lot of change to make in the world together. I look very much forward to the day when we see you back here among all of our colleagues, helping us move forward in a new direction to achieve that visionary change that had at its focal point the possibilities of humanity.</paragraph>
