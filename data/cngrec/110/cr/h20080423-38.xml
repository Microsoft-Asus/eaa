    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues from the State of California in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="4185">H.R. 4185</bill>, which names the postal facility in El Monte after Specialist Marisol Heredia, a distinguished and heroic American servicewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4185">H.R. 4185</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Solis of California on November 11, 2007, was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008, by a voice vote. The measure has the support of the California delegation, and provides us with yet another opportunity to pay tribute to a member of our country's Armed Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Marisol Heredia was only 19 years old when, on September 7, 2007, she died at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio as a result of complications suffered from a noncombat-related injury she received on July 18 in Baghdad, Iraq. Specialist Heredia was assigned to the 15th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Described as a strong-willed and perceptive young woman, Specialist Heredia held the rank of Specialist 4, and had served for months in war-torn Iraq before being badly burned on July 18 while refilling a generator. Although this special young lady was only 19 years old when she lost her life, her service and faithful commitment to preserving the liberties and freedoms for which our Nation is built upon are sure to live on forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, let us remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifice made by Specialist Marisol Heredia and pass this measure at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of <bill type="h" number="4185">H.R. 4185</bill>, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in El Monte, California, as the Marisol Heredia Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Army Specialist Marisol Heredia of the 15th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Calvary Division, Fort Hood, Texas, was a young woman with a promising future. Specialist Heredia's life was tragically taken from her at the age of 19, while dutifully serving in the United States Army. She was deployed in Baghdad, Iraq, where she sustained noncombat-related injuries, which eventually led to her passing. Her injuries were sustained on July 18, 2007, during the performance  of a routine duty, the refueling of a generator. After a long and hard-fought battle, she ultimately succumbed to those injuries on September 7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before enlisting, this young lady was a gifted student, who graduated from Mountain View High School with a GPA in the 3.5 range. During her time in high school, she developed an affinity for the French language and culture, becoming the vice-president of the school's French club. Joining the Army shortly after her high school graduation, she wanted to follow in her sister Claudia's footsteps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enlisting to serve our great Nation is a selfless and brave vocational choice. Specialist Heredia served as an example of how military service is inherently dangerous and that those dangers are not limited solely to those in the battlefield. She's survived by her sisters, Claudia and Carolina; her mother, Rosa Heredia; her stepfather, Jose Dominguez; and her fiance, Travis Beaumont, a fellow United States Army soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gratitude for her bravery and sacrifice to her country, I ask all Members to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="4185">H.R. 4185</bill>, which will rename the post office in El Monte, California, in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
