    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, on the President's request 5 years ago, Congress launched a global campaign to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and to treat and care for those who are already afflicted. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act was a bipartisan bill from its inception. Today, the Foreign Affairs Committee again brings a bipartisan global HIV/AIDS bill to the floor, and again this important reauthorization bill enjoys strong support from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The negotiations that brought forth this compromise bill were conducted in the same bipartisan spirit that guided the 2003 act into law, a spirit made possible by close cooperation between two former chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committee, our late colleagues Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, and I am pleased to note that this important reauthorization bill is named for these two foreign policy titans in recognition of their contributions to battling HIV/AIDS overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a direct result of the extraordinarily successful law we passed 5 years ago, the United States has provided lifesaving drugs to nearly 1.5 million men, women and children; supported care for nearly 7 million people, including 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children; and prevented an estimated 150,000 infant infections around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2003 legislation firmly established the United States as the leading provider in the world of HIV/AIDS assistance for prevention, treatment and care. It has reminded the global community that Americans are a compassionate and generous people, and so has helped to repair our Nation's badly-damaged image overseas. In many ways, that legislation has had great healing power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, with this initiative we have ensured that HIV/AIDS is no longer the certain death sentence it was just 5 short years ago. Hospital corridors that were jammed with AIDS patients waiting to die now brim with hope as lifesaving drugs are dispensed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reauthorization bill before the House today reaffirms our commitment to the programs and policies established 5 years ago. The 2003 legislation  worked well as an emergency intervention, but it must now be modified to reflect the constantly changing nature of the HIV/AIDS crisis. We also have 5 years of experience under our belts and we know what works and what does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The law we passed in 2003 was designed to deal with the emergency phase of the global HIV/AIDS crisis. The Lantos-Hyde bill will move our programs towards long-term sustainability that will keep the benefits of U.S. global HIV/AIDS programs flowing to those in need. With this reauthorization act, host governments will also gain the ability to plan, direct and manage prevention treatment and care programs that have been established with U.S. assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2003 legislation authorized $15 billion over 5 years. In response to the desperate need for lifesaving medicine and a greater number of trained health care workers in nations hard hit by HIV/AIDS, the bill before us authorizes $50 billion over 5 years for these three pandemics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2003 law relied upon the health care workforce already in place in the developing world, yet in many of the hardest hit areas of the world there are simply not enough doctors and other health care workers to meet the challenges of this pandemic. The Lantos-Hyde legislation invests new funds in training new professionals and paraprofessionals, as well as building existing capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2003 law focused on creating new programs to tackle the HIV/AIDS crisis. The reauthorization bill increases the number of individuals receiving prevention, treatment and care services. It also builds stronger linkages between the global HIV/AIDS initiative and existing programs designed to alleviate hunger, improve health care, and bolster HIV education in schools, an approach endorsed by the President's Global AIDS Coordinator just a few short weeks ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2003 law gave inadequate attention to the needs of women and girls. The new legislation remedies this situation by strengthening prevention and treatment programs aimed at this especially vulnerable population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reauthorization legislation also eliminates the one-third abstinence-only earmark, but requires a balanced approach to HIV/AIDS sexual transmission prevention programs and a report regarding this approach in countries where the epidemic has become generalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before you today is a compromise in the best sense of the word, and it is in the true spirit of the great leaders of this committee who guided the 2003 act into law, Chairmen Lantos and Hyde. This bill is the result of more than a year of preparatory work and weeks of discussions, concluding with a bipartisan agreement with the White House. President Bush has indicated his support and his intention to sign it into law as soon as Congress acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all its strengths, the bill before the House today is not perfect. No compromise ever is. No one got everything they wanted in this compromise legislation. But with this agreement, we have maintained the strong, bipartisan coalition behind the global HIV/AIDS initiative which has been critical to winning rapidly increasing funding levels for this important initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, 20 million innocent men, women and children have perished from HIV/AIDS, and 40 million around the globe are HIV positive. Each and every day another 6,000 people become infected with HIV. We have a moral imperative to act, and to act decisively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will speak more lengthily about the subject, but I do want to initially extend my particular appreciation to our ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who played a critical role in working with the majority to reach this compromise. A number of Members on her side from the committee were active. Don Payne, the gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, was critically involved, as was Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, who played such  a key role in the 2003 law, as well as a number of other people, such as Congressman Carnahan. I can't mention everyone who was involved, but this was truly a collaborative effort that started long before I became Chair of the committee, with great work by Chairman Lantos last year and with the staff of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank my good friend, the new chairman of our Foreign Affairs Committee, Howard Berman. He has got a tough act to follow, because we all loved Tom Lantos. The gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) had a hard act to follow, but, boy, did he fill those big shoes very well. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been your first trial by fire, and you came out looking so well because you accommodated the concerns and the anxieties and the worries that so many of  our Members had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank on a bipartisan level all of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, from the most conservative to the most liberal. We were able to forge a compromise that reached a broad consensus on this vital and complex legislation. We couldn't have done it without the leadership of Chairman Berman, but also without his very able staff and the staff on our Republican side of the aisle as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foundation of this bill, as Chairman Berman has pointed out, is the 2003 Leadership Act, which was the first comprehensive U.S. emergency response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic and which stands as a noble legacy of our two former chairmen, Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos. They understood, as do all of us, that millions of lives around the world depend on our country's willingness to battle this pandemic together. It does honor to our country that 5 years ago we undertook this true mission of  mercy. We are fortunate to have the opportunity to reaffirm that commitment by our vote here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the passage of the original Leadership Act of 2003, extensive emergency treatment and prevention programs have begun to slow the advance of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The success of these programs is well documented. I would like to cite some specifics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, more than 1.4 million people infected with the HIV virus are now being treated with the necessary drugs to fight this disease. PEPFAR has supported HIV testing and counseling for 30 million people, cared for million 6.7 million, and, as the chairman pointed out, including almost 3 million orphans and vulnerable children. We are on our way to achieving the 5-year goal of preventing the infection of 7 million people. PEPFAR has supplied medicines  for approximately 800,000 expectant mothers, preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections. What a successful program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us keeps faith with the core principles of the Hyde-Lantos Act. We have modified the original blueprint by adding or adjusting a number of provisions based on 5 years of real-world experience regarding what works and what doesn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to medicines and sophisticated methods of treatment, the 2003 act mandated that a more comprehensive approach be used that took into account local values and indigenous cultures, and the act before us does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to this balanced approach, the wife of the President of Zambia said it best recently when she said, "There are several ways in which we can reach the young people. One of the effective ways is abstinence. It brings back dignity and self-responsibility to young people, because they know their bodies are not supposed to be abused and they learn to say no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The compromise bill before us removes the specific directive in current law so that implementation, as the chairman has pointed out, can be better refined to reflect the varying circumstances in host countries. Nevertheless, the bill before us continues this comprehensive approach by requiring that the AIDS Coordinator provides a balanced approach for prevention activities for sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS and to ensure that abstinence and faithfulness programs are implemented and funded in  a meaningful and equitable way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agreement that we have is carefully crafted and designed in the area of reproductive health and family planning to ensure that HIV funding for prevention is not misused to promote programs beyond the scope of this bill.  We can do that, if you wish, in other bills. But the bill ensures also that those working to fight these diseases are not required to choose between their conscience and receiving the assistance they need to carry out their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also we worked a lot on the prostitution and the sex trafficking pledge. The bipartisan agreement maintains the existing certification requirement that any group or organization receiving PEPFAR funds explicitly oppose prostitution and sex trafficking. The U.S. Agency for International Development has implemented this prohibition by requiring that any group that receives funding sign a pledge affirming its opposition to these practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear: Neither current law nor the pledge itself prevents organizations from working with prostitutes or other high risk groups, but it does mandate that that assistance to these individuals not be mistaken for approval or support of the activities that take their terrible toll on their bodies and that can only be described as destructive to human dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had issues with accountability and national security, and although this bill is absolutely motivated by the altruism of the American people, I believe that this legislation ensures that our interests are protected as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>For example, U.S. contributions to the Global Fund will be subject to more stringent oversight than is currently provided by calling for the Fund to meet even higher benchmarks of transparency and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also includes a prohibition on taxation of our assistance by foreign governments to ensure that assistance intended to the afflicted not be siphoned off by unaccountable bureaucrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also strengthens our national security. The HIV pandemic is first and foremost a health issue, but it also is one of the most significant global, economic, and security threats of our generation. General Charles Wald, the Former Deputy Commander of the US-European Command, has called HIV/AIDS the third greatest threat to our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria kill millions of people during their most productive years, between the ages of 16 and 50. And in the hardest hit countries, the AIDS epidemic alone is killing a generation of parents, of teachers, of health care workers, bread winners, peacekeepers, shattering the economic and the social life of villages, communities, and, indeed, nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Losses on this scale have staggered the economies of the hardest hit countries. Without further prevention, without further treatment, without further care efforts, the AIDS pandemic will continue to spread its mix of death, poverty, and despondency that is further destabilizing governments and societies and undermining the security of entire regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our former House colleague from Wisconsin, Mark Green, who now serves as the United States Ambassador to Tanzania, wrote to me following the committee's passage of this bill highlighting this security aspect. He said, "In tearing apart the social fabric and leaving a generation of orphans, the scourge of HIV/AIDS could spread and create a long-term breeding ground of radicalism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PEPFAR programs in turn help to counter these precursor conditions. As General Wald has said, "In addition to the obvious humanitarian efforts of PEPFAR, the program is one of our Nation's development activities that can help strengthen the social structure that keep communities and nations secure."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The threat is not just in faraway lands, but in our own back yard. Many countries in the Caribbean have been particularly hard hit. This bill places a new emphasis on assistance to this region. It adds 14 Caribbean countries to the existing list of nations in which the Global AIDS Coordinator is given explicit statutory authority over HIV/AIDS programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me add that, although all of us share the goal of reducing the further spread of this pandemic, this is also a personal issue for me both professionally and morally. South Florida, which falls within my congressional district, ranks first in the State of Florida in the number of AIDS cases. Roughly 19 percent of the State total for those living with HIV reside in my district. So, I am all too familiar with the human cost of this disease, and hope for the day when its ravages are safely confined  to the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although not all Members will fully agree with every aspect of this complex compromise, it does contain the bipartisan approach that we have maintained throughout the years of work on HIV/AIDS in our committee. We have an opportunity, indeed, a responsibility, to continue the lifesaving work that began 5 years ago. This legislation is a means by which that can happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the dry text of the legislation, nor the posters behind me, cannot adequately capture the human drama for which we are trying to write the exit strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The poster behind me shows where PEPFAR has worldwide activities, the number of countries where it has positively had an impact. The second poster shows the number of adults and children estimated to be living with HIV just this last year. And, the third poster shows some of the faces of the children whom this legislation has saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read, to conclude, from a Washington Post op ed authored by our chairman, Henry Hyde, 5 years ago. Mr. Hyde wrote,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Not since the bubonic plague swept across the world in the last millennium has our world confronted such a horrible curse as we are now witnessing with the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This pandemic is more than a humanitarian crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"To those who suggest that the United States has no stake in this pandemic, let me observe that the specter of failed states across the world is certainly our concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The AIDS virus is a mortal challenge to our civilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It is my hope that each of us will be animated by the compassion, and, yes, the vision, that has always defined what it means to be an American."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, endless numbers of children have already been orphaned and deprived of the protection and the love of their parents. We cannot make their world whole again, but there is much that we can do to comfort and care for them and to prevent others from suffering the same fate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill in a strong bipartisan manner, and thereby allow our country to continue our mission, our mission of mercy, for the waiting millions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlelady for her wonderful statement, and I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman, and I ask for time for the purpose of the gentlelady from Missouri and I entering into a colloquy with the chairman on the importance of integrating food and nutrition programs with the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, families, and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I traveled to Africa and had the opportunity to see firsthand many of our programs related to food security. In Ethiopia and Kenya, I visited HIV/AIDS programs to look at how food and nutrition was included. At that time, I heard from local communities, NGO partners, and our embassy staff how restrictive guidance for global HIV/AIDS assistance often hindered their ability to design and carry out effective food and nutrition programs targeted at HIV/AIDS affected individuals, families,  and communities. The lack of resources available for food and nutrition programs within the global HIV/AIDS assistance and from other sources also posed a significant barrier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much appreciate and support the work of the committee in ensuring that this bill addresses these concerns throughout, and especially in the section entitled "Food Security and Nutrition Support." The bill recognizes that strengthening the linkages and enhancing coordination among HIV/AIDS programs and vital development programs, like food and nutrition programs, will significantly increase our effectiveness in the fight against HIV/AIDS while we advance other essential U.S. development  priorities. I remain concerned, however, that the bill is less clear on where or how such funding will be provided for these purposes. It is not clear on how much funding will  come from the Global HIV/AIDS program versus other sources of funding. I am concerned that, without adequate resources</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the chairman will agree that we want to avoid this scenario of robbing Peter to pay Paul so that we do not end up shortchanging other communities suffering from hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to yield to the gentlelady from Missouri in this regard.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400121" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am also concerned that the situation will become even worse, because the cost of food, commodities, and transportation is skyrocketing. Just last month, on February 12, the USAID's Office of Food for Peace announced that the cost of wheat and other food the United States donates to poor countries jumped 41 percent, 41 percent, in the first half of fiscal year 2008. According to USAID, this means $120 million in food assistance will not be available for people who are malnourished  or food insecure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask the chairman to work on strengthening the language in the bill as it moves through the legislative process and into conference negotiations to clarify how the necessary level of funding for food security and nutrition will be provided, especially in light of rising food and transportation costs, so that funds won't be diverted from U.S. programs addressing chronic hunger and emergency operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>And I yield back to the chairman to express his views.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, before I respond with my views, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to express his views on the subject of this colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as you know, the provision on food and nutrition security in the bill currently under consideration is drawn directly from a bill I introduced in December, <bill type="h" number="4914">H.R. 4914</bill>, the Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and Nutrition Support Act of 2007. I introduced the bill after chairing a hearing in the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health to determine whether the Global HIV/AIDS program was adequately addressing the nutritional needs of its beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hearing corroborated what I had already heard in the field on numerous visits to Africa over the past 5 years: PEPFAR is falling short in this critical area. I share the concerns of the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentlelady from Missouri about the increasing cost of food aid. Just last week, the World Food Program had to issue an appeal for an additional $500 million to offset the increased costs of food and fuel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Without the extra $73 million, people who rely on WFP for their daily sustenance may have their rations cut. This is a truly alarming situation, and it is not my intent for the provision of this bill to exacerbate it. The language under consideration very clearly states that these activities are to be funded from amounts authorized under section 401 of this bill. I used this language deliberately, as I strongly believe that the food assistance and nutritional support we are providing  under the Global AIDS program must be on top of the food aid we are already providing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes to respond to the concerns raised during this colloquy. I thank my colleagues for raising these important concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> provides clear and specific instructions to the USAID Administrator and the Global AIDS Coordinator to address the food and nutrition needs of individuals with HIV/AIDS and other affected individuals, including orphans and vulnerable children; and to fully integrate food and nutrition support in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs carried out under this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to emphasize that the committee and I personally share our colleagues' concerns about the negative effect rising costs are having on our long-term and emergency food aid programs. This is a matter that has our most serious attention, because it affects a wide array of our food aid and development programs, including the effectiveness and success of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to reassure my colleagues that I will be working over the coming weeks to strengthen and clarify in the bill that food security and nutrition programs, especially those referred to as wrap-around services, are not to be funded with monies diverted from other standing commitments to address food and security elsewhere in the world or in these countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 30 seconds' additional time to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman for that assurance. I know that many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle stand ready to support him in these efforts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Many have described the crisis: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria. These take countless lives every day, especially on the continent of Africa. These diseases devastate families, they devastate communities, and nations. This bill is titled the "Leadership Act," and it is titled that way because it honors two former Foreign Affairs Committee chairmen who indeed did show leadership in forging this legislation 5 years ago. And, with this act, the United States will continue to lead in  tackling these killer diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As others have said, this legislation did not come together easily; and the reason it is difficult is because many people have strong views on how best to fight these diseases. This bill is a compromise. It would have been far easier to hold onto positions, probably, but that would have gotten no bill. But, instead, those working on it did the hard work to craft a policy that most everyone could support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Frankly, had it not been done, it would have been a sharp rebuke to the work Chairman Hyde and Mr. Lantos did 5 years ago. Tens of millions of people around the world would have lost, and America would have lost. That we are in this position now, to continue these two men's legacy, is due to the dedication of Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen. I particularly appreciate their inclusion of a provision I had recommended prohibiting foreign countries, foreign governments,  from taxing our aid, and I thank them for that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While endorsing the policy, the bill's authorization level is a great concern, as others have expressed. I have conferred with enough people working in the field and been in enough African countries to doubt the ability to productively absorb this very large funding level, which is well over the administration's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while these are devastating diseases, these countries face many other public challenges, some deadly, which may be shortchanged. Our country has many public health needs, too. That leads me to believe that this would be a better bill if it conformed more closely with the level the administration, which has gotten real results, thinks it could best spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this bill's authorization level will be addressed in our recommittal motion which will be offered for a vote before this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, I thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, and a key architect of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me begin by commending Chairman Berman of the committee for bringing forth this tremendous, important legislation, and for the support in this bipartisan effort from Ranking Member  Ros-Lehtinen, and for her support of this very important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of the legislation currently under consideration. I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is appropriately named because it was under the leadership of the late Henry Hyde, then chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that the PEPFAR legislation was originally authorized. And under the leadership of the late Tom Lantos, reauthorization began. Both of these tireless giants who have left us should be remembered by this legislation. I might also note that under the leadership of the original authorization, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and the Congressional Black Caucus  were very strong advocates to push the leadership of the House and the President to consider this very important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 5 years, there has certainly been a pandemic that the world is facing, and there has not been a pandemic similar to this since the plague during medieval days in Europe. So I am pleased that we are finally dealing with this pandemic in the way that it should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 5 years since Congress passed the original legislation authorizing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, as it is well known, it has become an historic program. In my opinion, this will be remembered as the single most significant achievement of President Bush's two terms in office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And from my recent conversations with the President, I know that he has worked very hard on this reauthorization, and it is with the support of the White House and the staff, they helped us craft this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to PEPFAR, the United States did very little in supporting AIDS treatment programs abroad. In fact, Members may recall a high-ranking USAID official said that treatment was not feasible in Africa, the most heavily AIDS-infected region of the world, because Africans cannot tell time and therefore would not be able to take the required medication properly. As we know, it was foolish to say that at the time; and as we have seen the results, it has proven once again to have been a foolish statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These officials advocated limiting our activities only to education and prevention, a position that would have in effect sentenced millions of HIV-infected men, women and children to die if it were only that program. And so I am very pleased we expanded it to where it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the Congress and the President did not agree with that position. And because we were willing to find a way to provide treatment for over 800,000 people, today they are receiving antiretroviral medication to prevent AIDS in the 15 focus countries, 12 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also pleased that we are increasing the number of countries to the 14 Caribbean countries. And as cochair of the bipartisan Caribbean Caucus, and under the leadership of Representative DONNA CHRISTENSEN, at a meeting she convened in her district, we had health ministers admit that the Caribbean also needed substantial help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our progress, while significant, is not enough. Only 28 percent of Africans needing antiretrovirals are receiving them. Shockingly, over 85 percent of African children who need ARVs are going without them. A mere 11 percent of HIV-positive women who need drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during child birth are getting them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In light of these troubling facts, we have taken steps in this legislation to transform PEPFAR from an emergency response to a sustainable program by expanding the program beyond a series of medical interventions. For example, the committee incorporated the provision that I discussed earlier about food security into the legislation in order to address the nutritional needs of HIV patients, their families, and communities heavily affected by the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lack of food and nutrition support has been, up to now, a major impediment to the adherence of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> also contains provisions to build and strengthen health systems in developing countries. The committee has given the Office of Global AIDS Coordinator the flexibility to do prevention, care and treatment programs tailored to the characteristics of the epidemic in the country in which they are operating by eliminating cumbersome earmarks that the GAO said were ineffective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill authorizes significant funds, $50 billion over the next 5 years, in order to accomplish the goals of the bill. I urge the House to pass this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am proud to yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, who has worked so long and so hard on this topic.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, an admittedly long, but appropriate title for a bill that is long on substance, meaningful intervention, tangible compassion, and relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aptly named for two of the giants of this institution who helped shepherd President George W. Bush's PEPFAR initiative through the Congress in 2003, <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> will literally mean the difference between life and death to millions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today is consensus legislation, a delicate balance that if kept intact, and only if kept intact, will be signed into law. So I want to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and other Members and staff for helping to forge today's PEPFAR consensus. I want to especially thank Sheri Rickert, Mary Noonan, Autumn Fredericks, Yleem Poblete, Peter Yeo, Pearl Alice Marsh, Dr. Bob King, Kristin Wells, and David Abramowitz for their extraordinary work  in drafting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as Members know, close to 70 percent of the estimated 33 million people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 2.5 million children afflicted with this dreaded disease, 90 percent live in Africa as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When combined with opportunistic infections like tuberculosis--the number one killer of individuals with HIV--and malaria alone kills one million each year, again mostly in Africa--the HIV/AIDS pandemic compares among humanity's worst. Former Chairman Hyde frequently compared the sickness to the bubonic plague--the black death--an epidemic that claimed the lives of over 25 million people in Europe during the mid-1300s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know some Members are likely to wince at the cost of the bill--$50 billion over 5 years for PEPFAR, the Global Fund, Tuberculosis, and Malaria--but that sum of money will be used to prevent 12 million new HIV infections worldwide, and support treatment for 3 million people, including an estimated 450,000 children. That sum of money will provide care to 12 million individuals with HIV/AIDS, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children, and will help train and deploy at least 140,000 new  health care professionals and workers for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the prevention side, the legislation requires that the Global AIDS Coordinator provide balanced funding for sexual transmission prevention including abstinence, delay of sexual debut, monogamy, fidelity, and partner reduction. If less than 50 percent of the sexual transmission prevention moneys are spent on the Abstinence and the Be Faithful parts of the ABC model, the coordinator must provide a written justification. I note that currently, the coordinator exercises waiver authority in this  regard without notifying Congress so this language ensures greater transparency and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years, Madam Chairman, after PEPFAR first began, the efficacy and importance of promoting abstinence and be faithful initiatives have been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt, and the evidence is compelling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to joint comments by the U.S. Department of State, USAID, and  HHS on PEPFAR, "Congressional directives have helped focus U.S. Government prevention strategies to be evidence based. Because of the data, ABC is now recognized as the most effective strategy to prevent HIV in generalized epidemics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The original legislation's emphasis on AB activities has been an important factor in the fundamental and needed shift in U.S. government prevention strategies from a primarily "C" approach prior to PEPFAR to a balanced ABC strategy. The Emergency Plan developed a more holistic and equitable strategy, one that reflects the growing body of data that validates ABC behavioral change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. government report goes on to say that recent data from Zimbabwe and Kenya mirrors the earlier successes of Uganda's ABC approach to preventing HIV. These three countries, with what is known as "generalized epidemics," have demonstrated reductions in HIV prevalence. And in each country, the data point to significant AB, abstinence, be faithful; behavioral change; and modest, but important, changes to C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I want to thank Mr. Pitts for writing the original AB earmark into the original law because it has instructed and has had a tremendously positive impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note to my colleagues that this past September the Foreign Affairs Committee heard from a world renowned expert, Dr. Norman Hearst, who said that 5 years ago he had been commissioned by U.N. AIDS to conduct a technical review of how well condoms had worked for AIDS prevention in the developing world. And he said, and I quote in part, "my associates and I collected mountains of data, and here is what we found: When we looked for evidence of public health impact for condoms in generalized  epidemics, to our surprise we couldn't find anything. No generalized HIV epidemic has ever been rolled back by a prevention strategy primarily based on condoms. Instead, a few successes in turning around generalized epidemics, such as Uganda, were achieved not through condoms, but by getting people to change their sexual behavior."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on to say that these are not just our conclusions. A recent consensus statement in the Lancet was endorsed by 150 AIDS experts, including Nobel Laureates, the President of Uganda, and officials of the most prominent international AIDS organizations. And it said, "the priority for adults should be, B, limiting one's partners. The priority for young people should be A, not starting sexual activity too soon." And this contrasted with other funders that often officially endorse ABC, but  in practice continue to put their money in the same old strategies that have been unsuccessful in Africa for the past 15 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Washington Post article by Craig Timberg noted that "men and women in Botswana continued to contract HIV faster than almost anyone else on Earth. Researchers increasingly attribute the resilience of HIV in Botswana, and in southern Africa generally, to the high incidence of multiple sexual relationships."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Researchers increasingly agree," and please, I ask my colleagues to take note of this, "that curbing behavior is key to slowing the spread of AIDS in Africa." In a July report, southern African AIDS experts said that reducing multiple and concurrent partnerships was their first priority for stopping the spread.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the legislation before us also leaves intact the anti-prostitution/sex tracking pledge, a policy designed to ensure that pimps and brothel owners don't become, via an NGO that supports such exploitation, U.S. government partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last February, the U.S. Government Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the prostitution pledge and said, in pertinent part, "In this case, the government's objective is to eradicate HIV/AIDS. One of the means of accomplishing this objective is for the U.S. to speak out against legalizing prostitution in other countries."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court of Appeals goes on to say, "it would make little sense for the government to provide billions of dollars to encourage the reduction of HIV/AIDS behavioral risks, including prostitution and sex trafficking, and yet to engage as partners in this effort organizations that are neutral towards or even actively promote the same practices sought to be eradicated."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we've come a long way, Madam Chairman, since 2003, when significant opposition materialized against an amendment that I had offered to ensure that faith-based providers, and others, are not excluded from participation. Worldwide, but especially in Africa, faith-based organizations are absolutely critical in the fight against AIDS. So, we welcome and are deeply grateful for their support and their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conscience clause in <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> restates, improves, and expands conscience protection in a way that ensures that organizations like the Catholic Relief Services, with its 250 plus projects in 52 countries, which has had a remarkable record on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care, are not discriminated against or in any way precluded from receiving public funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill is carefully crafted, and again, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the enormous amount of work that has been poured into its creation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. And remember, this is a bill about HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. He played a major role in the tuberculosis section of the bill, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank our distinguished chairman for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, named after our dearly departed two great House Foreign Affairs Committee chairmen that I had the pleasure of serving under, Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose a major threat to the health of the global community, from the most severely affected regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, as the chairman mentioned, I'm the chairman of the Subcommittee of the Western Hemisphere, to the emerging epidemics of eastern Europe, central Asia, south and southeast Asia, and Latin America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to take this time to pay tribute to our colleague who is in the Chamber, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who has worked so hard in combating global AIDS, probably harder than anyone else in the Congress. I'm delighted that she's here, and her hard work has not gone unnoticed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While most widely recognized for reviewing our commitment to global AIDS relief, <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> reauthorizes provisions on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, all deadly diseases of poverty. The Lantos-Hyde Act is a decisive step forward for global health, particularly for our efforts to control tuberculosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take a moment to specifically address the tuberculosis provisions included, as the chairman mentioned, as my bill <bill type="h" number="1567">H.R. 1567</bill>, the Stop TB Now Act which passed the floor earlier this year, was largely incorporated into this bill, and I'm delighted about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Health Organization reports that 1.5 million people died of tuberculosis in 2006, with another 200,000 dying from HIV-associated tuberculosis. The multi-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant TB, known as MDR and XDR, poses a grave risk to global health. A contagious airborne disease, TB knows no barriers or borders and can only be successfully controlled in the United States by controlling it overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Lantos-Hyde Act declares TB control a major objective of U.S. foreign assistance programs. In support of WHO targets, the bill prioritizes halving TB deaths and disease, cutting them in half, and achieving a 70 percent detection rate and an 85 percent cure rate by 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lantos-Hyde Act prioritizes the Stop TB Partnership's strategy, which includes expansion of the successful treatment regimen for standard TB, treatment for individuals infected with both TB and HIV, treatment for individuals with drug-resistant TB, and enabling research and development of new tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the deadly synergy between TB, an opportunistic infection, and HIV, the Lantos-Hyde Act authorizes assistance to strengthen the coordination of HIV/AIDS and TB programs. TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>And the explosion of drug-resistant TB in sub-Saharan Africa threatens to halt and roll back our progress in combating both diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation supports key TB-HIV activities, such as providing AIDS patients with TB screening and treatment, and providing TB patients with proper counseling, testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the legislation authorizes assistance for the development of new vaccines for TB. The current TB vaccine is more than 85 years old and is unreliable against pulmonary TB, which accounts for most of the worldwide disease burden. New TB vaccines have the potential to save millions of lives and would lead to substantial cost savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies modelling the 10-year economic benefits of a vaccine that is 75 percent effective have estimated worldwide savings in medical costs of $25 billion or more.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support for the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act. I want to commend the current leadership of the committee, the bipartisan leadership, Mr. Berman and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their leadership in moving this legislation to the floor in a bipartisan way. And it's most appropriate that it be named after Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, two  distinguished chairmen of the International and Foreign Relations Committees that changed names, but one thing that was in common between Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde was they always worked to ensure that foreign policy should be a bipartisan product and a team effort. So, it is so appropriate that they be recognized by naming this legislation after them, which reauthorizes President Bush's emergency plans for AIDS relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted by a number of my colleagues, almost 33 million citizens of this planet today suffer from the consequences of HIV/AIDS. We have a moral responsibility, and it's important that the United States exhibit and demonstrate moral leadership in addressing this crisis, which not only is a health issue, but it's a security issue for this globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we all watched the reception of President Bush when he traveled recently to Africa and the appreciation that was shown by the leadership in Africa for the President's initiative and the bipartisan support that we've seen in the effort against AIDS, and to help those who are victims of AIDS in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We often think of Africa when we talk about global AIDS, but of the 33 million, there are also many living in Latin America and the Caribbean who suffer from HIV/AIDS as well. In Latin America today there are 1,600,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, that's up from 1.3 million in 2001; and 58,000 citizens of Latin America have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS. In the Caribbean, 230,000 adults and children are currently known to be infected with HIV/AIDS. That's up from 190,000 in 2001. In the Caribbean,  11,000 citizens of the Caribbean have lost their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note we've made some progress as a result of the President's initiative for AIDS relief. In Haiti alone, a large recipient of aid as a result of this initiative, almost 4 percent of the population of Haiti is infected with HIV/AIDS. Think about that, 190,000 people. And since 2004, thanks to this initiative, the number of people receiving care and support has grown from 30,000 to 125,000, and an anticipated 150,000 people will be reached this year because of this initiative. Haiti received  almost $85 million from this program in the past year to address this crisis which affects many in the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point is is that PEPFAR, as we know it, has allowed us to reach almost every person in Haiti struggling with HIV/AIDS. And, for example, the continued support is necessary to make sure we reach every person struggling with HIV/AIDS in the world, and that's why this extension is so important.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would also like to share a couple other examples of the success of this initiative and how this funding is helping regular people and making a difference in Latin America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bolivia, a large nation the size of Texas with 9 million people, thanks to the PEPFAR initiative we're using data to combat HIV/AIDS. In fact, real-time data is helping Bolivian health officials carry out more HIV/AIDS prevention education, including HIV counseling and testing services. And according to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, prevalence rates in Bolivia's general population has remained at 1-10th of 1 percent, which is remarkable success compared to some of its neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Central America, in the Republic of Honduras, beginning in February of 2005 the United States awarded its first set of grants through USAID to 10 local nongovernmental organizations working with 43 Honduran communities most impacted by HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In their first 7 months of implementation, the organization has reached over 27,000 at-risk individuals with behavioral change models. As part of the HIV prevention efforts, the group began offering HIV counseling and testing, and the counseling and testing programs were the first in Honduras to be offered by those trained in accordance working with the Ministry of Health standards as part of a larger national prevention effort. And this collaboration between the government of the Honduras, USAID,  indigenous organizations and the Ministry of Health has set this standard expanding access to testing in the Nation of Honduras.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, this program is making a difference in combating what is clearly a terrible crisis throughout the world, currently impacting 33 million citizens of this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation, and it's important that the United States continue to exert the leadership and demonstrate the leadership we have over the last few years to address the global AIDS crisis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am very pleased to yield to my friend from California, someone who has been heavily invested in getting our attention on this issue and passing the legislation, putting, fashioning and passing the legislation in 2003 and again this time, our gentlelady from California, Barbara Lee, for 5 minutes.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me begin by thanking Chairman Berman, our ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, our subcommittee chair, Mr. Payne, also Chairman Waxman, Mr. Smith, ranking member of the subcommittee, and all who have helped to make this legislation an amazing piece of legislation. And I know that Chairman Lantos and Chairman Hyde  want to thank us and are here with us honoring their legacy because they would want to see  this move forward as it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one the five original co-authors of both the initial legislation establishing PEPFAR and of this new bill reauthorizing PEPFAR, I am pleased that we are moving forward. And again, I have to thank Chairman Berman and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for making sure that this legislation is really in the spirit of the bipartisan cooperation that we have moved forward with in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no other piece of legislation that we will consider in Congress this year that will have the greatest impact on the lives of people around the world. Like many, I have witnessed firsthand many times the dramatic and positive impact of our AIDS programs on individuals and communities throughout the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. But it wasn't always this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, 10 years ago, actually, when I first came to Congress, I think it was 10 years in April, the world really had not recognized the devastating toll that HIV and AIDS were beginning to take on families and communities throughout Africa. Since that time, however, we have worked together on a bipartisan basis on a number of very important legislative initiatives that have put the United States on the right side of history when it comes to this global pandemic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, in 2000, we passed and President Clinton signed into law, <bill type="h" number="3519">H.R. 3519</bill>, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act. Now this important bill was a vision inspired by an idea by our former colleague and our friend, former Congressman, now Mayor Ron Dellums of Oakland, California to establish an AIDS Marshall plan in Africa, for Africa, funded through a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the help and leadership of our former colleague, Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, we turned this idea into legislation which provided the founding contribution and the framework for what we know today as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, working with both former Chairmen Hyde and Lantos, Mr. Berman, Mr. Payne, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Mr. Smith, we drafted <bill type="h" number="2069">H.R. 2069</bill>, which was called the Global Access to HIV/AIDS Prevention, Awareness, Education and Treatment Act. This was the first bill that dared to provide large scale antiretroviral therapy to people living in the developing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we made progress in advancing this legislation through Congress in 2001 and 2002, we weren't able to reach a conference agreement with the Senate before the 107th Congress. Thankfully, however, our discussions would lay the foundation for quick action in the next Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So at the end of 2002, the Congressional Black Caucus, along with practically every advocacy group in the United States, sent a letter to President Bush urging him to set up and create a presidential initiative on AIDS especially for sub-Saharan Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of 2003, the President took up our cause, understanding the growing sense of urgency that had been building for years. His promise of $15 billion during his State of the Union address provided the impetus that we needed to pass <bill type="h" number="1298">H.R. 1298</bill>, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, which created PEPFAR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, we took yet another step forward when we recognized that our foreign assistance programs did not adequately address the needs of children orphaned or made vulnerable by AIDS. So, working again with former Chairman Hyde and Chairman Lantos, we passed, and the President signed <bill type="h" number="1409">H.R. 1409</bill>, the Assistance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, I lay out some of the history of our work on this important issue because it speaks volumes about what is possible when we come together in the spirit of bipartisan compromise as we honor the great legacy of both Chairman Lantos and Chairman Hyde through this legislation. Chairman Lantos, I know, very much wanted to reach a bipartisan compromise on this bill, as did Chairman Hyde. I'm saddened that both of them are not with us to witness this moment. But I know that they are  very pleased with what we have put together today.</paragraph>

Dr. Pearl Alice Marsh, of course, Kristin Wells, David Abramowitz, Peter Yeo, Bob King, Yleem Poblete, Mark Gage, Joan Condon, Heather Flynn, Sheri Rickert, Naomi Seiler, Jessica Boyer, and of course Christos Tsentas of my staff. These staff members and other members, they deserved, their work deserves really to  be applauded because this was not just work as a professional on the Hill. This is part of their life's work and I have to thank them again for their diligence and their competence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bipartisan compromise, so there were things that we had to give up and things that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle had to give up, but that's what compromise is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just mention a few of the items that were included in this bill. Of course it included language taken from my bill, <bill type="h" number="1713">H.R. 1713</bill>, the PATHWAY Act, to strike the 33 percent abstinence-until-marriage and provide a comprehensive prevention strategy to address the needs of women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also includes language taken from my bill, <bill type="h" number="3812">H.R. 3812</bill>, the African Health Capacity and Investment Act, to build health capacity by recruiting, training and retaining health professionals and strengthen health systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, of course there's still some issues I think need to be addressed which aren't in this bill. I think we should eliminate the prostitution pledge, which violates the first amendment and poses an unnecessary barrier to organizations that work with sex workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we need to recognize the public health benefits of linking our HIV and AIDS programs with family planning services by eliminating ideological restrictions imposed by the global gag rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we need to end the unjust and discriminatory travel and immigration ban on people living with HIV and AIDS who wish to enter into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these are not impossible goals. In addition, we should fully fund the recruitment, training and retention programs for health professionals with a focus on training doctors and nurses to build health capacity and strengthen health care systems. So I hope that we can do this as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me again thank the chairman for his leadership in addressing the greatest humanitarian, national security and public health crisis of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise in support of the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible tells us to whom much is given much is expected. And I believe the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in confronting the pandemic of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dimensions of this crisis are truly staggering. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has infected more than 60 million people worldwide. It has killed more than 25 million, a number which grows grievously every day by more than 8,500. HIV/AIDS has orphaned some 14 million children. And today, 70 percent of the people in the world with HIV/AIDS reside in Africa. Within that continent, there are entire countries where more than one-third of the adult population is infected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More startlingly, if current infection rates continue, new epicenters for the disease are likely to arise out of India,  China, Eastern Europe with numbers that could surpass Africa in a few short years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the threat this pandemic poses to our security is also real. Left unaddressed, this plague will continue to undermine the stability of nations throughout the two-thirds world, leaving behind collapsing economies and tragedy and desperation, a breeding ground for extremist violence. This is truly a global crisis. And because the United States can render timely assistance, I believe we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally titled the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR put the world on notice that America will not ignore despair, desperation and disease. I am proud to have supported the original passage of PEPFAR in 2003, and I'm proud to support it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, every so often, in this place, we have the opportunity to do something for humanity and serve the American people, and this is such a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their strong leadership. I commend my colleague, Chris Smith in particular for his yeoman's work on carefully preserving the delicate balance of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also would like to publicly acknowledge the work of our President, George W. Bush. Mr. President, because of your moral leadership and compassion, Africa will never be the same, and history will record your work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Global AIDS bill seeks to address the crisis, not by providing medicine and health care to those in need, but also by providing resources for evidence based programs that have been successful in preventing infection. It's imperative, I believe, that we not only send our resources, but we also send them in a manner that is consistent with our values. We cannot send billions of dollars to Africa without sending value-based safeguards and techniques that work to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS  by changing behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, within the Global AIDS bill, these pivotal provisions exist in the form of a requirement to "provide balanced funding for prevention activities" and to ensure that abstinence and faithfulness programs are "implemented and funded in a meaningful and equitable way."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was essential that we preserve these prevention methods that focus on behavioral change, that we work with faith-based and nongovernmental organizations at the local level, particularly through the ABC model that has produced such undeniable results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, it was absolutely critical that we administer this foreign aid under the historic pro-life guidelines that prevent our foreign aid from going in a direction that's antithetical to the values of millions of Americans. I'm pleased to say the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill preserves all of these vital pro-family provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we tend to the suffering though, we always have to figure out how we're going to pay for it. The Federal budget, I believe, is packed with wasteful and bloated programs which could supply more than enough opportunities to cover the costs of the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This summer, Madam Chairman, when it comes time to fund this program during the appropriations process, I believe Congress should make the hard choices necessary to ensure that this global health crisis does not become a crisis of debt for our children and grandchildren. I believe it is possible to be responsible to our fiscal constraints while being obedient to our moral calling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The greatest of all human rights is the right to live. America is a Nation of great wealth, wealth of resources, but more importantly, a wealth of compassion. The history of the world is filled with telling moments regarding the character of a people. Sometimes we are witness to mankind's great inhumanities; other times, we marvel at the beauty of mankind's selfless acts of compassion when we rise above politics and raise up those in dire need. Let this be such a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill and its carefully crafted bipartisan compromise.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 liberal minute to the majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to the chairman of the committee. He is an extraordinary individual whom I have known for four decades. He will do an excellent job. We lament the loss, however, of the two individuals for whom this bill is named.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well for her leadership, and I want to associate myself generally with the remarks of the previous speaker. And I think it is emblematic of the partnership that we have, not only with the administration, but on both sides of the aisle as it relates to this moral, as well as health, issue, and I thank the gentleman for his comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, 5 years ago, the United States made an unprecedented commitment to the people of the world who suffer from HIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases. We pledged $15 billion, and with that funding, we have provided life-saving drugs to almost a million and a half people. We facilitated care for over 2 million orphans and vulnerable children and provided mother-to-child transmission prevention services during more than 6 million pregnancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have played a very real role in helping to transform HIV from a death sentence to a manageable disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Madam Chairman, as I said 5 years ago when we first passed this legislation, we must recognize that our Nation and each one of us has a moral obligation and a national security interest, as has been spoken of, in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as malaria and tuberculosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with this legislation, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act, we build on and increase our commitment to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through this legislation, we make a $50 billion contribution to the fight to eradicate HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition to expanding our prior efforts, this carefully negotiated legislation will strengthen HIV-related healthcare delivery systems and increase health workforce capacities; foster stronger relationships between HIV/AIDS initiatives and other support programs, including those that promote better nutrition and education; allow HIV/AIDS testing and counseling to be provided  in the United States bilateral family planning programs, and it finances prevention and treatment programs targeting women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, Madam Chairman, also eliminates an ineffective requirement: that one-third of PEPFAR prevention funds be spent on abstinence. Instead, we have directed the administration to create a balanced approach requiring behavioral change programs to receive 50 percent of the funds devoted to the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV, and in addition, we require the administration to report to Congress if programs in nations where the epidemic has become generalized do not adhere to this  balanced approach. This legislation represents both commitment and compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will not make everyone happy, but it does signal to the international community that the United States recognizes and accepts our moral obligation to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year alone, 2.5 million people contracted HIV, roughly 6,800 people per day. Last year alone, 2.1 million people died of HIV. Global AIDS is a problem too large to fall prey to political sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My very good friend, the late Chairman Lantos, noted 5 years ago that this health care crisis ruins families, communities, and indeed, whole nations, fueling violence and bloodshed across borders. And thus, it is a global challenge that demands a global humanitarian response with the United States in the lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is a very good bill. It builds on proven outcomes, and it deserves the support of the Members on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, I congratulate Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen on their leadership on this effort.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of 5501 and to congratulate our new chairman of the International Relations Committee and to thank our chairman and to thank our Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, and particularly congratulate the chairman of the Africa and Global Health Care Subcommittee for writing a bill that clearly reaffirms Congress' commitment to healthy communities, this time with the focus overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the subcommittee, I'm especially pleased that this bill supports maternal health, orphans, and vulnerable children. Today, in Africa and throughout the world, children are losing their parents to the AIDS epidemic. These same kids will grow up too soon. They will be forced to become caregivers to their own siblings, leaving school, joining the underage workforce, praying that they are not the next in line for the graveyard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a world as prosperous as our own, Madam Chairman, it is absolutely unacceptable that this could be happening anywhere. But this bill actually continues our promise to rid the planet of this plague. This bill offers real hope. We invest in treatment, but most importantly, it works towards prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of my colleagues, I'm disappointed that conservative forces pushed to reduce the Reproductive Health Initiative, but the overall result will actually be remarkable. And most importantly, it will be life saving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> to make this a better place to live in worldwide.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I also want to thank President Bush for reaffirming his commitment to Africa in his State of the Union but also to being open to improvements in how we deliver our support in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to also add my thanks to Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership in bringing this to the floor, but especially to Chairman Berman for his great instincts to reach out and craft an achievable and better bill in this Congress in this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have an opportunity to improve the way the U.S. funds and administers these HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria programs around the world. I believe that it is important to make real changes and real progress in reauthorizing this vital life-saving program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February, I had the opportunity to travel to Ethiopia and study and investigate the effectiveness of many of these programs. The positive effect that PEPFAR has had over the last several years is quite obvious: countless lives have been saved and numerous infections have been prevented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited health clinics in rural Ethiopia, including PMTCT, family planning, and government-supported clinics. This bill makes important steps to not just increase funding but to have a more balanced approach to integrate prevention programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I would have liked to have seen even greater integration in these programs with family planning and prevention programs, I'm pleased with the steps the bill does take and steps that are being taken in a bipartisan way that can help this be done sooner.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan agreement that will reauthorize PEPFAR for an additional 5 years. I want to thank both the Chair of the committee, Howard Berman, the new and very capable chair of the committee, Howard Berman, as well as my long-time friend, the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their crafting of the legislation and in naming it the Tom Lantos/Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis  and Malaria, the Reauthorization Act of 2008. And in so doing, I think it enhances the legacy of both of these fine gentlemen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say from the start, I support the strong program and will urge my colleagues to do the same. The first 5 years of PEPFAR have provided unprecedented prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS for millions around the world. By passing this bill we can, and we will, do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through PEPFAR, the United States has spearheaded the global fight against HIV/AIDS by supporting services to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. These services have helped women during more than 10 million pregnancies and led to the prevention of more than 150,000 infant infections. It has supported life-saving treatment for almost 1.5 million men, women, and children. In the focus countries, over 60 percent of those receiving treatment are women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my honor to say that I have supported this program when it was first introduced before this body, and I worked to ensure that PEPFAR was as effective and as efficient as possible. An example of this bipartisan effort was the inclusion of language, which I championed, to emphasize education on gender equality and respect for women and girls. The reauthorization act strengthens these provisions by calling for the empowerment of women and youth and by promoting changes in male behavior and  attitudes that respect the human rights of women and youth and that support and foster gender equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>However, let me be equally clear, this bill could do so much more and could prevent many more infections if it improved a critical partnership with these programs in the fields that have served women and their families for over four decades, and that is in the field of family planning providers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the House version of the U.S. Global AIDS Act contains language suggesting that only family planning programs compliant with the global gag rule will be eligible to receive PEPFAR funds to provide HIV education, counseling, and testing. I believe that this would be a new restriction. No such requirement exists in current law or policy. And I believe if we are serious about preventing the most new infections, we need to put aside our political differences on the merits  of the global gag rule and ensure that the very best in the field have the support of the U.S. to do what they need to do, and that is prevent the spreading of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we know what needs to be done. The PEPFAR reauthorization bill is it, and we're doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill not only reauthorizes PEPFAR but also dramatically strengthens the programs. H.R.  5501 elevates the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria from an emergency to sustainability. In so doing, we declare that HIV is no longer the death sentence that it was only 5 short years ago. We can hope and strive for a generation free of HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman and the subcommittee chairman for including provisions in the legislation that Representative Granger and I introduced, which strengthens the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. We must ensure that women and children have access to early screening and lifesaving drug therapies. We can do this by providing greater training and education on effective prevention. We also must ensure that they integrate these services with other maternal health  efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day more than 1,000 children around the world are infected with HIV. An estimated 90 percent of those infections occur in Africa. But a single dose of an antiretroviral drug given once to the mother at the onset of labor and once to the newborn during the first 3 days of life reduces transmission by 50 percent. Fewer than 10 percent of pregnant women with HIV in resource-poor countries have access to these prevention services. But I'm proud that this bill includes prevention provisions  to strengthen our commitment to prevention and save lives in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most important provisions are those that recognize the importance of expanding access to screening and treatment of women and children. <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> also provides my provisions to establish two 5-year targets that will bring us closer to a generation free of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first goal is to increase the percentage of children receiving treatment under PEPFAR from 9 to 15 percent. Treatment allows the greatest hope for giving a child infected with HIV the chance to an adulthood free of the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second goal is for 80 percent of pregnant women in the most affected countries to receive HIV counseling and testing and, where necessary, antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biggest limitation on reaching these goals is the availability of trained personnel. This bill sets a goal of 140,000 people to be trained by 2015. In South Africa, where my wife is working on the ground in this epidemic, they are closing pediatric hospitals because there's no pediatrician to run them. Now, the 80 percent goal is a down payment on our hope of achieving 100 percent by the time this authorization expires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a chance today to send a message that America cares enough to lead the world in fighting these deadly diseases. We should speak loud and clearly. The legislation gives more people the chance to be survivors instead of statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important bill that strengthens our commitment to fighting the global HIV/AIDS/TB and malaria epidemic.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This legislation represents the best in bipartisan compromise, and it demonstrates that, despite what divides us from time to time as Republicans and Democrats, we can and do come together to tackle issues that matter most.

    <paragraph>Just 5 years ago, an HIV diagnosis for a poor villager in Africa was a death sentence. Thanks to lifesaving drugs provided by the American people, this is no longer the case.

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I just returned from South Africa, and I did a single codel visiting the various clinics and hospices that are receiving PEPFAR funds. And I happily report that the small donations they do receive are stretched beyond imagination. They are finally realizing that the NGOs have really made great strides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 4 years ago, when we went offering them assistance and so on, most of our help was rejected. But I want you to know that one clinic, which is a hospice, gets $70,000 a year. And what they do is reach out to the NGOs in the area. There are volunteers from America there. They run an excellent facility, and you can see gradual progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was told by our appointed ambassador that he was going to reduce the amount of donation by $50 million, and I cautioned him because that would be the wrong message to send for the small successes they have had and that what we can do is say to the government there that we will cap it at a certain amount and then you need to also kick in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to report to our committee and to Mr. Payne, the Chair, that the funds are working. They're improving our image, and they're helping to save lives in South Africa.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, there's a terminology that we use to describe joyous occasions. Sometimes it describes freedom. The Fisk Singers in Tennessee were called the Jubilee Singers, and it was because they organized around slavery and after slavery and the ability to be free with jubilation, and, therefore, they were called the Jubilee Singers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think today is a day of jubilation, and it certainly is a time to express the jubilation that we feel with the passage, or the intended passage, of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Payne, for persistence and determination and wisdom. Let me also acknowledge his ranking member, Mr. Smith; and, of course, our chairman, Mr. Berman; and the ranking member of the full committee, Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for working with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do want to spend some time acknowledging that we have named this bill after the late former Chairman Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde. That is a jubilation. It is something to express great excitement about because these two distinct figures, in many instances with common views but many instances different views, came together around this lifesaving legislation, Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. And it is particularly important because we have added malaria and  tuberculosis as an element that is not a partner but results thereof and/or stands alone, but all of them kill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of the first mission to Zimbabwe, to Zambia, and to South Africa, where we went on a Presidential mission, three Members of Congress, to look closely at the devastation of HIV/AIDS. It was in 1996/1997. And it was there that I saw a 4 year old taking care of a dying grandparent, the last person surviving who had tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. So this legislation is crucial, and it is particularly crucial because it recognizes the devastation of all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is likewise crucial because we have not won the war. The jubilation is that the bill is on the floor, but we have not won this war. And I might also say that we have not won the war in education, the ability to prevent all of these diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me ask my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, The Global HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. I believe that the legislation we are considering today makes vital improvements to  what is already a groundbreaking program. I would like to thank Chairman Berman for his ongoing leadership on this issue, and for bringing this legislation to the floor today. I would also like to thank the Committee's Ranking  Member, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, and my colleagues across the aisle, for working toward a compromise, to develop legislation of which we can all be proud. Today's legislation is a crucial step toward transforming PEPFAR from an emergency response to a sustainable program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank both Chairman Berman and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African and Global Health, Congressman Payne, for working with me to include important language in this legislation. My language, in Section 301 of this bill, addresses the necessity of making children a priority among individuals with HIV for proper food and nutritional support. Section 301, with my language included, states that it is the sense of Congress that "for the purposes of determining  which individuals infected with HIV should be provided with nutrition and food support--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(i) children with moderate or severe malnutrition, according to WHO standards, shall be given priority for such nutrition and food support; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(ii) adults with a body mass index, BMI of 18.5 or less, or at the prevailing WHO-approved measurement for BMI, should be considered `malnourished' and should be given priority for such nutrition and food support;"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe that this language is crucial, and I thank the Chairman for including it in the text of the bill. HIV-infected children have been underrepresented among beneficiaries of PEPFAR-supported programs. As this legislation cites in the findings section, "of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals." And even these large numbers are deceiving,  as children die much quicker from AIDS than do adults. UNICEF reports that every minute, a child dies from an AIDS-related illness, and only 1 child in 20 who</paragraph>
    <paragraph>needs HIV treatment receives it. I am pleased to see this language, which focuses attention on the plight of these children, and makes serving their needs a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased to support an amendment offered by my colleague Congressman Carson. Representative Carson's amendment would direct the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to expand their plan for strengthening health systems of host countries by allowing for postsecondary educational institutions, particularly in Africa, to collaborate with United  States postsecondary educational institutions and specifically historically black colleges and universities. I believe that such educational exchanges would be extremely beneficial for students both in our own Nation and in developing nations. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am also pleased to support the amendment offered by my colleague Congressman Blumenauer. This amendment adds safe drinking water to nutrition and income security on the list of programs for which direct linkages are encouraged. People with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk for diarrheal diseases, and these illnesses leave HIV-infected patients with a reduced ability to absorb antiretroviral and other medications. The availability of safe drinking water must be part of any  sustainable strategy of HIV prevention and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this House is aware, it is estimated that HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, TB, and malaria together kill more than 6 million people each year. In January 2003, President Bush announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. As its name implies, PEPFAR was envisioned as an emergency response; the bill before us today represents a crucial first step in the process of transitioning to a sustainable program to address these global epidemics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen years after the first cases were diagnosed, AIDS remains the most relentless and indiscriminate killer of our time, with 39.5 million people worldwide now living with HIV or AIDS. Despite pouring billions and billions of private and Federal dollars into drug research and development to treat and "manage" infections, HIV strains persist as a global health threat by virtue of their complex life cycle and mutation rates. Of those infected, 24.7 million, or about 63 percent, live in Sub-Saharan  Africa, a region with just 11 percent of the world's population. 61 percent of those infected in this region are women. Though Africa, and even more specifically African women, bears the brunt of the AIDS pandemic, Americans should be reminded that HIV/AIDS does not discriminate, with well over a million people in our own country currently living with HIV or AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, 6 percent of the 39.5 million people currently infected with HIV/AIDS are children under 15 years of age. In 2006, the virus killed 380,000 children (13 percent of all HIV/AIDS deaths), and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>90 percent of all children living with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa. According to UNAIDS statistics from 2005, 1,500 children worldwide became newly infected with HIV every single day, due largely to inadequate access to drugs that prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Only 8 percent of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries were offered services to prevent HIV transmission to their newborns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, HIV/AIDS continues to represent a serious and large-scale challenge throughout much of the world. It goes far beyond a simple health problem, and it hinders attempts to foster economic development and political stability. As we reauthorize PEPFAR, I believe it is crucial that we emphasize the long-term sustainability of our HIV efforts, and that we integrate AIDS prevention and treatment within our larger-scale development initiatives. I believe that the legislation before us  today makes groundbreaking strides toward moving the Global HIV/AIDS program beyond emergency implementation and toward sustainability. It dramatically boosts HIV/AIDS programming related to women and girls, strengthens health systems in countries hardest-hit by the HIV virus, increases U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, and authorizes HIV/AIDS programs to include linkages to food, nutrition, education, and health care programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though we have drugs that are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. For this reason, there is growing consensus among health experts that we must put greater emphasis on comprehensive prevention programs, which are perhaps the most critical aspect of any initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. Even as increasing numbers of people have access to anti-retroviral  drugs, ARVs, an estimated 5.1 million people who needed treatment did not receive it in 2006. In sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of individuals needing treatment who actually received it rose substantially, from 2 percent in 2003 to 28 percent in 2006. This growth is impressive, and represents a significant step forward, but it also means that 72 percent of sub-Saharan Africans requiring treatment did not receive it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, despite our concerted efforts, we continue to face a serious and persistent health threat. I believe that it is imperative that we ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to greatest effect, not to bolster ideology. This legislation makes important strides forward by removing elements of the original authorization that speak more to ideology than actual conditions in the field. Under the current law, one-third of all prevention funds under PEPFAR must be used on abstinence-only  education, which neglects the real needs of populations both in America and abroad. These stipulations hurt the ability of PEPFAR to adapt its activities in accordance with local HIV transmission patterns, and they impair efforts to coordinate with national health plans. Though AIDS is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>clearly a global problem, it does not affect every nation equally or in the same manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am extremely pleased that the legislation we are considering today removes these restrictive provisions, allowing PEPFAR to better address the requirements of each country, making more efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars in serving the millions affected by this disease. According to studies by both the Government Accountability Office and the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, the abstinence-only earmark has forced a reduction in mother-to-child  transmission programs, reduced prevention efforts with high-risk groups, and undermined efforts to implement Abstinence, Faithfulness, and Condoms, ABC, prevention programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the provisions of today's compromise legislation, the administration will be directed to promote a "balanced" prevention program in target countries. This will include all elements of the ABC approach to HIV prevention. The legislation will require that the administration report to Congress if behavioral change programs do not receive 50 percent of funds devoted to the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV in countries in which there is a generalized epidemic. I believe this language  is extremely important, as it not only recognizes that HIV is transmitted in other ways, besides sexual activity, but it also acknowledges that the epidemic is not the same in every country. By requiring a report, rather than earmarking the expenditure of funds, this legislation provides guidance while still affording organizations working in the field the flexibility to respond to nuanced circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be part of this Democratic Congress, which will produce legislation reauthorizing a Global HIV/AIDS program driven by facts, rather than ideology. The removal of the abstinence-only earmark will make this reauthorization legislation stronger than the original  2003 legislation that it will replace, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose any efforts that might attempt to reinstate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I believe it is crucial that we dedicate greater attention to strengthening local health infrastructure. Health experts have expressed concern that the high amount of spending directed toward HIV/AIDS initiatives has drawn health workers away from public health facilities and other important programs. This merely compounds a chronic shortage of qualified health workers, which, according to WHO's 2006 World Health Report, is the single most important health issue facing countries  today. This need is felt particularly sharply in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many health experts also continue to advocate greater integration between PEPFAR and other health programs, including those focused on nutrition, maternal and child heath, and other infectious diseases. These experts note that HIV is intricately linked to these other areas of concern; for example, malnutrition  and lack of food may heighten exposure to HIV, raise the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, increase susceptibility to infection, and complicate efforts to provide anti-retroviral, ARV, medication. Further, an HIV epidemic will likely worsen food insecurity, by depleting the agricultural workforce. I believe it is necessary, to ensure maximum effectiveness, that we integrate PEPFAR with other aspects of our international health outreach and development programs. The legislation before  us today does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, while I recognize the importance of compromise, and I am glad we were able to reach an accord with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am disappointed that the compromise text does not include a repeal of the language, known as the pledge requirement, requiring that all funding recipients to "have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the removal of the prostitution pledge was a critical facet of the bill we are considering today. The pledge currently restricts recipients' privately funded HIV prevention programs. No funds may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Funding recipients must refrain from speech or conduct that is inconsistent with the Government's views on prostitution, even when they use private  funds. Organizations must refrain from some effective HIV prevention strategies, for fear that the Government will view it as "pro-prostitution." A repeal of the prostitution pledge language would leave in place language ensuring that U.S. Government funds may not be used to "promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution and sex trafficking."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the prostitution pledge undermines prevention efforts targeting one of the populations most vulnerable to HIV transmission. Because high-risk populations such as sex workers are extremely marginalized, it is crucial that any intervention promotes a level of trust between sex workers and service providers. Failure to provide sex workers with information and services that will help them protect themselves and their partners from HIV transmission and other sexually-transmitted diseases  also puts the broader community at risk. I am disappointed that this legislation does not remove this vague and counterproductive requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also contains crucial provisions with regards to malaria and tuberculosis prevention and treatment. It incorporates <bill type="h" number="1567">H.R. 1567</bill>, the Stop Tuberculosis, TB, Now Act of 2007 sponsored by Congressman ENGEL, important legislation which I am proud to cosponsor. Today's legislation emphasizes the linkages between HIV/AIDS and TB, and it also creates new strategies for attacking MDR and XDR forms of drug-resistant TB. The bill also requires the President to develop a comprehensive  5-year strategy to combat malaria globally and strengthen United</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States leadership against this disease, and creates a new Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are to turn the tide of turmoil and tragedy that HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis cause to millions around the world, and hundreds of thousands right here in our backyard, it is imperative that we continue to fund and expand medical research and education and outreach programs. However, the only cure we currently have for HIV/AIDS is prevention. While we must continue efforts to develop advanced treatment options, it is crucial that those efforts are accompanied by dramatic increases  in public health education and prevention measures. Investments in education, research and outreach programs continue to be a crucial part of tackling and eliminating this devastating disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans, we have a strong history, through science and innovation, of detecting, conquering and defeating many illnesses. We must and we will continue to fight HIV/AIDS until the battle is won.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at this time I am pleased to yield 1 minute to my colleague, my friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to sending $50 billion, $50 billion taken from the American people, to Africa to fight AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to this situation with AIDS in Africa, obviously, we have some people in crisis who are very deserving people. But where does that $50 billion come from? Are we going to be helping people overseas at the expense of the well-being of our own people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are only three ways of getting the money: We can take it from domestic programs, take it from those programs to help our own elderly and the health care for our own people, our own veterans; or we can raise taxes, which would knock the legs out from under our economy and make our deficit even higher; or we can borrow the money. And if we borrow the money, we end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on interest. We're going to borrow $50 billion in order to help people overseas  and then end up paying interest on it for the next umpteen years? This is benevolence gone wild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we would like to help everybody in the world. But if we vote for this, it's the most irresponsible measure that I have ever seen in my term here in Congress for 20 years. We are taking directly from our veterans, from our elderly, and others to give $50 billion to Africa.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus what we have to decided to is, are we going to deprive our own people, our seniors? I just came from a meeting with doctors from my district. We can't afford to provide health care for our seniors, for our veterans. We can't afford all the educational things we want to do. How can we possibly, then, take $50 billion and send it to Africa, even though it's a worthy cause?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not be doing this. It is not in the interests of the American people. And I would call on my colleagues to oppose this totally wasteful expenditure of money.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It is my pleasure to recognize the Speaker of the House for 1 minute, the gentlewoman from California, Speaker Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and recognize his extraordinary leadership on issues that relate to the alleviation of poverty and eradication of disease, which really are a national security interest for our country. They are about the health and well-being, the respect we command throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Chairman Berman. I think this is probably the first piece of legislation to come out of the committee under your leadership as chairman, and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member of the committee, for their leadership in bringing a bipartisan, strong initiative to the floor. This initiative is a continuation of the work that President Bush has as a priority in the eradication of AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who have been involved in these issues over the years, whether on the committees of authorization, and Congresswoman Barbara Lee has been on the authorizing committee, and now on the appropriating committee; Congresswoman Waters, in many ways in the House; and you, Madam Chairman, all of us know that for our country to be healthy, for the eradication of these diseases to take place, we must have a global approach to it. Disease knows no borders and boundaries.  So, again, while it is the compassionate thing to do, it is in our self-interest to do as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished chair, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and I, and others, just had the opportunity to visit a PEPFAR site in India at the Salvation Army, where they were distributing these drugs through a regimen, an organized regimen related to hygiene and the rest to people with HIV and AIDS. We can tell you from firsthand experience; I visited these  sites in south Africa, this trip was to India, that wherever we go, there is great  appreciation for what our country is doing, and President Bush's leadership on this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so pleased that the bill is named for Congressman Chairman Lantos, our friend who left us earlier this year, and Congressman Hyde before that, because they were the original authors of the first historic President's emergency plan for AIDS relief legislation in 2003. That landmark bill authorized $15 billion for 5 years. Working together with the Bush administration and Appropriations Committee, we succeeded in providing lifesaving antiretroviral treatment to almost 1.5 million people, supporting  care for nearly 6.7 million people, including more than 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children; and supporting prevention of more than 150,000 infected infants. We are talking about AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Now we must take the next step in fighting AIDS in the poorest countries of the world. The legislation before us will move us from the emergency phase to the sustainability phase in fighting AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues have presented the provisions of the bill to you, so I will just submit mine for the Record, Madam Chairman, and just say in closing that the leadership against HIV/AIDS is our compact with developing nations across the globe. It says that America stands with them in this fight, that our commitment will not waver, and shows them America's true face of passion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the AIDS epidemic began, 20 million men, women, and children have died from the disease. Twenty million. Forty million around the globe are HIV positive. That is what we know. We don't even know of those who have not come forth to be tested. Each and every day, another 6,000 people become infected with HIV. In addition, the number of orphans, vulnerable children with sick parents and adolescents at risk with HIV continues to grow, with an estimated 19 million needing assistance by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a moral imperative to combat this epidemic. If we have these drugs distributed in the manner in which they are under the President's program, this PEPFAR, then people will come forward to be tested, then we will have better success with our prevention initiatives. So it's all related. Care causes people to say there is a reason to be tested, and knowing the consequences of the disease contributes to the prevention effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few crises have called out for more sustained constructive American leadership. This legislation before us makes that commitment. I urge our colleagues to support it. Once again, I salute you, Mr. Payne, for your leadership in so many ways that relate to, again, the eradication of disease and the alleviation of poverty and the strength of America related to that and how we are viewed in the world and how that all contributes to a healthier America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these, if we don't, we will have a fury of despair that springs from a lack of hope in the world that contributes to violence and, again, takes us back to the security of our country. So for that security, and out of compassion, I urge my colleagues to support this initiative, which is President's Bush's initiative, named for our colleagues, Mr. Lantos and Mr. Hyde, put forth by the chair, Mr. Berman, and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen in a strong bipartisan way, and we salute  that, and advocated by Mr. Payne of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Chairman Howard Berman and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for their bipartisan efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and to help alleviate poverty and disease in the developing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is appropriately named to honor the two authors of the first historic President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief legislation in 2003. That landmark bill authorized $15 billion over 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working together with the Bush administration and the Appropriations Committee we succeeded in: providing lifesaving antiretroviral treatment to almost 1.5 million people; supporting care for nearly 6.7 million including more than 2.7 orphans and vulnerable children; and supporting prevention of more than 150,000 infant infections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we must take the next step in fighting AIDS in the poorest countries of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today will move us from the emergency phase to the sustainability phase in fighting AIDS, TB and Malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will: authorize $50 billion for the sustained commitment required to stop the global AIDS pandemic; dramatically strengthen health care delivery systems; encourage new and innovative ways to deliver the ABC prevention message; improve relationships with governments and NGOs; eliminate the requirement that one third of the funding be used for abstinence programs; improve services for women and girls and prevent violence against them; and build stronger linkages to health care and  hunger initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act is our compact with developing nations across the globe. It says that America stands with them in this fight, that our commitment will not waver, and shows them America's true face of compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began, 20 million men, women, and children have died from the disease. Forty million around the globe are HIV-positive. Each and every day, another 6,000 people become infected with HIV.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="CLOSE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, sometimes when we are negotiating legislative text or debating the merits of an important bill, such as the one before us today, we can lose sight of the extent of the impact that our decisions here can have on the lives of so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to quote from some of the African leaders whose people and societies have been rescued from certain death by our PEPFAR programs. The President of Tanzania has said the following, "There would have been so many orphans to date. Had it not been for PEPFAR, the care and treatment, so many parents now who would have been infected can now live. And some of them can live as many years as possible. So can you imagine if this program is discontinued or disrupted? There would be so many  people who would lose hope, and certainly there would be death. You create more orphans. So my passionate appeal is for PEPFAR to continue."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or listen to the words of the President of Botswana when he said, "PEPFAR is now a critical partner in the historic and heroic battle to save lives. PEPFAR has turned despair into hope. PEPFAR has galvanized donor countries and agencies alike to act in concert in the interest of humanity. If the fund is not renewed and if it is not replenished, the momentum generated by PEPFAR thus far will no doubt be lost, and the hope rekindled by the generosity of the American people will be extinguished.  I say this to you," said the President of Botswana, "and that's what I said to the congressional committees recently."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, these and so many other statements reflect the human contribution of this critical United States program. But they also demonstrate that PEPFAR programs are helping to win hearts and minds throughout the world. They are building and strengthening the bonds between the governments and the people of these countries and the United States of America. They are building good will toward our Nation and toward the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, after the deplorable attacks on our Nation on that fateful day almost 7 years ago, we in this Chamber committed ourselves to using the range of U.S. foreign policy tools, including soft power, to counter the conditions that breed hatred, intolerance and radicalism; radicalism that targets the United States, our interests and our allies, and seeks to undermine our freedom and democracy everywhere. The bill before us is a vital tool in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as our former colleague, our Ambassador to Tanzania has said, "I  want you to know that PEPFAR is crucial to my current mission as Ambassador to the United Republic of Tanzania. It is a tremendous public diplomacy tool that shows America at her best, a compassionate partner who is committed to helping Tanzania meet its enormous HIV/AIDS challenges."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I was asked to present remarks to the National Consultive Meeting of Islamic Leaders and Scholars here in Dar es Salaam," continues the Ambassador. "This was a historic gathering, as it was the first time that the most esteemed Muslim leaders of Tanzania had gathered together to discuss their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS. They invited me to speak alongside the President because of their concern about HIV/AIDS and their awareness of America's historic contribution to HIV prevention,  treatment and care programs." Why? Because of PEPFAR. "So as we help to save lives and restore hope," the Ambassador ends, "we are leaving a lasting impression on the people of this country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I hope that our colleagues will see the great merit of this program and that we will continue to build upon it to save many more lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague from California, the gentlelady, Maxine Waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MS. WATERS. Madam Chairman and Members, I am pleased and proud to be here today to commend not only Chairman Berman but the late Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde for their wisdom and their foresight in putting together this most important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, I just returned from south Africa and I am pleased to announce that while I was there, I was recognized and given the Order of the Companions of Oliver Tombo Award for my work to help dismantle apartheid in South Africa, and basically for being a friend of south Africa's. I was very proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as I sat there talking with President Umbeke and others, I was reminded that in south Africa there is an estimated 5.5 million people living with HIV and AIDS. That is more than any other country in the world. Over 18 percent of the adult population of south Africa is infected by HIV. Infected persons include thousands of well-educated professionals, such as doctors, nurses, civil servants, and teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognizing that we have done a great job in helping to promote democracy and get rid of apartheid, the enemy now is HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis. They are losing all of their professionals. They don't have the personnel to carry out the plan that they have put together to continue to move south Africa to where south Africa needs to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very proud that they had built 2.3 million new houses over the last 10 years. But, again, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS is destroying this population. This legislation will help this country and other countries. These are our friends. They love us. And they love us for having been involved in the struggle to help save them. These are countries that we will be able to count on in the world because we have come to their aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also recognize that there were many Americans traveling in South Africa. Those Americans who were there are being served by people who live in areas where tuberculosis and HIV is rampant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we need this for protection and security of all peoples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I inquire of the remaining time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="CLOSE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we have no further requests for time. I would like to make a few closing comments, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an accident of fate and hanging around a long time that put me in the position of managing this bill today, and it is the first bill not on the Suspension Calendar that has come out of the committee since I have become Chair. But the fact is the work on this legislation began a very long time before I became the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have been mentioned before, but there are so many new initiatives and so much thoughtful logic underlying this legislation that I thought it would pay to once again mention a group of staff people who, working under the leadership of our staff director, Dr. Bob King, spent a huge amount of time working for Chairman Lantos, working with the minority staff, to craft what became a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter Yeo; Pearl Alice Marsh; Kristin Wells; David Abramowitz; Macani Toungara; Heather Flynn from Chairman Payne's Africa Subcommittee; Christos Tsentas from Congresswoman Barbara Lee's staff; Naomi Seiler and Jessica Boyer from the Government Oversight Committee staff, all played important roles on our side in working on this legislation. Yleem Poblette on the minority staff made major contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result is a bipartisan product where in a way we have internalized on our side the logic of efforts to change behavior and recognized the validity of abstinence programs in the context of a comprehensive approach to this problem and accepted the value of faith-based organizations, and the minority has accepted the logic that this is a fundamental, moral and humanitarian concern that we should address and be willing to put a lot of value to, because we know it works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know there is a direct relationship between the resources we put into this program and the lives saved, the people who can avoid and prevent it, and that it has implications beyond just the moral and humanitarian dimension, as Speaker Pelosi and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen said, in terms of security and economic welfare and economic growth in so many parts of the world, which ultimately all inure to our benefit and our national interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, once again, I am very pleased to be part of this process with my partner, the ranking member.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="CLOSE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Tom Lantos Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. The passage of this bipartisan bill will continue Congress' commitment to the fight against HIV, T&amp;ndash;B and malaria around the world. Currently, 95 percent of people with HIV live in the developing world, and I believe we must be leaders in combating the global AIDS crisis. <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> would: dramatically  boost HIV/AIDS programs for women and girls, strengthen health and education systems in nations hard-hit by the HIV virus, and provide funding for orphans and vulnerable children, as well as food and nutrition programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Health Organization estimates that over 38 million people are living with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> provides needed funding and support to transition the very successful PEPFAR program, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Finally, I can think of no better way to honor our late chairman, Tom Lantos, and his predecessor, Henry Hyde, by naming this bill after them. Chairman Lantos was an inspiration to so many and spent his entire life fighting for those around the world that were less fortunate. His memory will live on through his wife, family, and the  lives of those who are saved with this vital legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to commend the chairman and ranking member of the committee for their work in bringing such a strong reauthorization before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an op-ed that appeared in the Washington Post a few weeks ago, Michael Gerson wrote that in voting for this bill, members of Congress can participate in "something extraordinary--a true miracle of science and conscience, and politics at its noblest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the emergency plan for aids was first announced, there were approximately 50,000 people on AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. Today there are roughly 1.4 million, so I share Mr. Gerson's enthusiasm for this bill, and I am proud of the statement we will make as a Congress by passing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also extremely encouraged by provisions in the Senate bill that will play a key role in the development of safe and effective microbicides. I hope that in conference, the Committee will look at these microbicides provisions, which hold great promise to save the lives of millions of women as part of a comprehensive program to stem the spread of global AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so pleased to be able to lend my voice in support of this critical and imperative bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="CLOSE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today to show my support for <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This important bill will aim to address the devastating effects of AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis on our global community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numbers from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS show that since AIDS was identified in 1981, about 65 million people have been infected with HIV and more than 30 million have died from AIDS. These numbers include the figures from 2005 that show more than 2 million of those living with HIV/AIDS were children and the daily infection of an estimated 1,500 children worldwide was due in large part to inadequate access to drugs that prevent the transmission from mother to child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, programs within the Department of Health and Human Services account for 71 percent of the total amount spent, with the U.S. as the largest single contributor to the Global Fund, an independent foundation dedicated to disbursing new resources in developing countries aimed at combating AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will further these efforts that we started 5 years ago by raising the United States' contribution to $50 billion over the next 5 years. I am also encouraged that this bill will encourage the development of a TB vaccine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The TB germ is constantly changing and drug resistant strains have been found in 28 countries on 6 continents, including right here in the United States, where it is estimated that 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. have latent TB. These drug resistant forms of TB have severe implications both internationally and domestically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Health Organization recently released its new tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance report. The WHO found that the MDR and XDR strains of TB are at their highest levels ever. Both of these strains are far deadlier than normal TB, and are much more difficult and expensive to treat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Department of Homeland Security recently identified XDR-TB as an "emerging threat to the homeland." For this reason, we need to devote resources to stopping this disease and developing a new vaccine is the first step. This is not a partisan issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my colleagues might ask why an AIDS reauthorization bill should be the vehicle for doing this; there is a very simple reason. TB is the number one infectious killer among people living with HIV/AIDS, and accounts for up to half of HIV/AIDS deaths in some parts of Africa. If we do not address TB in a systematic way and work to develop a vaccine, then much of the progress that we have made on addressing HIV/AIDS globally will be undone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies also show that the 10-year economic benefits of a TB vaccine that was only 75 percent effective could result in an estimated savings of $25 billion dollars. There is no denying that this is a significant amount. Our current TB vaccine, BCG, is more than 85 years old and is not compatible against pulmonary TB, which accounts for most TB cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a good start in our critical battle against TB. Finally, I am happy to see that this bill will encourage public-private partnerships in combating these diseases. The Baylor Pediatric AIDS Initiative has been working in Africa for several years, and the government should work with this and similar programs to leverage the expertise that they can provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support these strong health initiatives across the globe and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Lantos-Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world has achieved more in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the past decade than it has since this deadly epidemic began nearly 30 years ago, due in no small part to the efforts of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), combined with Congressional enactment of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a nation, we have provided care for more than 6 million HIV-infected individuals, including nearly 3 million orphans. We have prevented 150,000 infant infections by providing mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention services for more than 10 million pregnancies. And we have provided anti-retroviral drugs for nearly 1.5 million men, women, and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet in an era where 40 million men, women, and children are infected with HIV worldwide, and where infections continue at a rate of nearly 6,000 per day, U.S. global leadership on HIV/AIDS--as well as the associated diseases of TB and malaria--remains as important as ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quote Stephen Lewis, the former United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa: "the international community must now finally keep its word and mobilize for global AIDS treatment delivery ..... it is a moral imperative that global leaders and institutions keep their promises to scale up AIDS services with urgency and increased resources."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe passage of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> displays our commitment to doing just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation authorizes $50 billion over the next 5 years, including $41 billion for HIV/AIDS, $4 billion for tuberculosis, and $5 billion for malaria, and is designed to move these programs from the "emergency" phase, towards greater sustainability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I am pleased to see a strengthened focus on the needs of women and girls, and prevention and treatment programs targeted towards this population--including, for the first time, the provision of HIV/AIDS testing and counseling services in family planning programs. I would note that concerns have been raised that the bill's language would block HIV testing and counseling services from being offered by family planning providers that are not compliant with the misguided "global gag  rule" policy, and I hope that Congressional intent can be clarified that this is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also supportive of provisions that remove the requirement targeting one-third of prevention funding towards abstinence-only programs. Prevention programs must be evidence-based, rather than ideologically-based.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation doubles, to $2 billion per year, the U.S. contribution to the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund, with its emphasis on stimulating a global commitment under an umbrella organization with a truly international AIDS budget, is the best chance the world has of combating this epidemic. I urge my colleagues and the President to ensure that these new authorization levels are fully funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I applaud the bipartisan work of the Foreign Affairs Committee, including its new Chairman, Howard Berman, and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I also want to recognize and commemorate the leadership of our dear friend, Congressman Tom Lantos, whose commitment to the most vulnerable people worldwide continues to be felt through our work on HIV/AIDS. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="CLOSE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as one of the original cosponsors of this bill, I am proud of what it represents, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. This five-year reauthorization tells the world that the United States is truly committed to a sustainable global response to HIV, TB, and malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill raises our financial commitment. It authorizes the strengthening of local health systems and the training of workers, including the doctors and nurses on whom the sustainability of this program will rely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also eliminates the onerous abstinence-only spending requirement. It replaces it with a provision directing country teams to tell Congress if they spend less than half of their funds for sexual transmission on behavior change programs. This is merely a reporting requirement, and should not be understood as a restriction on country spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to acknowledge some concerns about the bill. Many would have liked to see stronger and more inclusive language encouraging linkages to reproductive health services. I would have liked to see such language too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also concern about the current requirement that recipients sign an "anti-prostitution pledge." People involved in sex work are very vulnerable to HIV infection, along with many other health and social risks. But what we hear from the field is that the pledge has had the unintended consequence of making groups shy away from effective outreach programs for sex workers. They are scared of running afoul of this broad oath requirement. I'm disappointed that we weren't able to eliminate  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I think we've got more work to do in certain areas, I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on several elements of the bill which I believe are vitally important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, despite the prostitution pledge, it is unambiguous that the intent of Congress is to direct close attention to the needs of sex workers and other marginalized groups. The bill specifically directs the provision of care, treatment, and prevention services to sex workers, injection drug users, and men who have sex with men. And it requires the development of strategies for providing evidence-based prevention services to each of these populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also makes some important refinements to the treatment program. The expansion of antiretroviral services has been a huge success. But many people still lack needed treatment. Others require more expensive second-line therapy. And while significant progress has been made in the utilization of generic drugs, some U.S. dollars are still being used to buy brand-name drugs when lower-cost generics are available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of these challenges, this bill instructs the AIDS coordinator to develop mechanisms for encouraging and facilitating the purchase of safe and effective drugs at the lowest possible price. The bill also requires the coordinator to report annually on the amounts paid for generic and branded antiretroviral drugs. And it requires that information on drug pricing be shared and updated routinely, so our partners can make purchases based on the best available information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I'd like to note that this bill puts an important new emphasis on research. While we've learned much through this program, we haven't seen a coordinated research agenda to address questions about what works and what doesn't, especially in the area of prevention. This bill mandates a detailed strategic plan for program monitoring, operational research and impact evaluation research. It also requires a strategy for maximizing the capacity of host countries to conduct their own research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we should not let these developments make us complacent. The most basic, but often most pressing, health needs of the world's poor aren't being met. Children are still dying for lack of clean drinking water. Women face staggering rates of morbidity and death related to pregnancy and childbirth. And people across the world succumb to disability and death from treatable, and often preventable, illnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we pass this bill today, let's not forget these other pressing health problems. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>. And I hope that the lessons and successes of our global AIDS program inspire us to reinvigorate our commitment to a broader global health agenda.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the critical bipartisan Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation to address the global pandemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It was 5 years ago that Congress took leadership to address this crisis. Today, because of Congress's actions, the United States has become the leading provider in the world of HIV/AIDS assistance, treatment, prevention and care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AIDS continues to be the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. The United Nations estimates that 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide, with an estimated 22 million HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 1.6 million deaths in sub-Saharan African resulted from AIDS in 2007. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to combating this deadly epidemic by reauthorizing the 2003 law and will give more flexibility to host governments in planning, directing, and  managing prevention, treatment and care programs that have been established with our assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the bill also includes a provision that authorizes funding for U.S. contributions to research and development of a tuberculosis vaccine. Tuberculosis is a deadly epidemic that faces our planet today. Nearly 2 million people die from it each year and approximately 9 million are diagnosed with tuberculosis annually. It is the largest killer of people with HIV/AIDS, accounting for one-third of AIDS deaths alone. The current tuberculosis vaccine is more than 85 years old and is  unreliable against pulmonary tuberculosis. New tuberculosis vaccines have the potential to save millions of lives and would lead to substantial cost savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let us honor the spirit of the two men--Chairmen Lantos and Hyde--who guided the 2003 law through this body in bipartisan manner by passing this much needed legislation to combat these deadly diseases.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of this important bill. PEPFAR-funded programs have provided life-saving assistance in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and I welcome any expansion of this assistance. Additionally, I am pleased that we have removed the "hard earmark" requiring 33% of all prevention funds be spent on abstinence-only until marriage programs. Studies by GAO and the Institutes of Medicine found that the one-third earmark undermines successful HIV prevention  efforts by limiting flexibility in developing countries. However, I continue to be concerned about any funds being directed towards unproven, ineffective programs using the "abstinence-only" approach. I worry that the new "balanced funding" requirement may cause mission directors and public health officials to be anxious about doing what they think Congress wants, instead of what is needed in the field. Public health experts on the ground are the ones who can best determine the mix of prevention</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This bill authorizes $50 billion over the next five years for international health programs, including $41 billion for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention, $4 billion for tuberculosis programs, and $5 billion for malaria programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just returned from South Africa, where I received the "OR Tambo Award," from South African President Thabo Mbeki. I received this award because of my efforts to end the brutal system of apartheid in South Africa and to obtain the release of South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison. Apartheid was dismantled and Nelson Mandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994, when South Africa held its first democratic elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very proud to receive the OR Tambo Award because I have always been and continue to be a friend to South Africa. However, in South Africa today, the enemy is HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that 5.5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. That is more than any other country in the world. Over 18 percent of the adult population of South Africa is infected by HIV. Infected persons include thousands of well-educated professionals, such as doctors, nurses, civil servants and teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everywhere I went in South Africa, people told me about the terrible problem they have trying to fill professional positions. The shortage of educated professionals is a result of the fact that so many South African professionals have died of AIDS or are too sick to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The involvement of doctors, nurses, teachers, and other professionals is critical to stopping the spread of HIV and AIDS. That is why I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to strengthen the health care infrastructure in countries like South Africa and train at least 140,000 new health care professionals and workers for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care. The bill also includes prevention funds to stop the spread of HIV and treatment funds to allow infected individuals to live productive  lives and continue to serve their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is impossible to address HIV without also addressing tuberculosis. Almost 9 million people develop tuberculosis every year. At least 2.4 million are killed by the disease. According to the World Health Organization, HIV and tuberculosis form a lethal combination, each speeding the progress of the other. In the past 15 years, tuberculosis rates have doubled in Africa overall and tripled in areas with high HIV concentrations. In some areas of Africa, up to 80 percent of tuberculosis patients  also test positive for HIV. This makes tuberculosis clinics an ideal location for HIV prevention, treatment, and care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in South Africa and around the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation reauthorizes and expands the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). I have long supported this bold initiative that has made the U.S. a leader in this critical health and moral issue of our time. PEPFAR has shown to the world our nation's vision and compassion in addressing this healthcare crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years ago, an estimated 31 million people were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, anti-retroviral drug treatments were expensive, and approximately 8,200 people were infected with HIV/AIDS every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard from a number of my constituents about their support for continued U.S. efforts to combat AIDS and the spread of HIV around the globe. It is obvious that Americans care. In the absence of a cure for AIDS, this worldwide epidemic continues to spread at an alarming rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am pleased that <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> makes an important transition from emergency relief to the establishment of long-term and sustainable AIDS relief programs. The legislation also works to better integrate the tuberculosis and malaria programs with the HIV/AIDS programs. This is essential because in sub-Saharan Africa tuberculosis is the leading killer of individuals with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the creation of this program, the United States has invested more than $19 billion to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The results have been striking. By the end of 2007, the United States had helped provide anti-retroviral drug treatments to approximately 1.5 million people with AIDS, supported care for 6.6 million--including 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children--and  helped to prevent more than 157,000 infant infections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> greatly expands our efforts abroad by authorizing a total of $50 billion over five years. This total includes $41 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, $5 billion for malaria programs, and $4 billion for tuberculosis programs. This dramatic increase in funding will help partner countries continue to identify and meet targets for treatment and prevention. Additionally, the funding will help build and strengthen the existing health systems in host countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support the underlying bill, I do have some concern about one specific issue. I have long been concerned by the restrictions placed on how PEPFAR funds can be spent. I have opposed the requirement that one-third of the funds be spent on abstinence-only education because it has not proven to be a successful way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that this restriction tied the local hands of public health workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that PEPFAR funds should be spent on the most effective HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention strategies available. That is why I am pleased that <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> removes the requirement that one-third of the funds be spent on abstinence education. As this bill works through the legislative process, I hope that any language in the bill that might be interpreted to limit funding to programs that are compliant with the global gag rule be removed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, our country has done more to end the spread of HIV/AIDS in the last five years than any nation in the history of the world. We must continue. This bill represents a reasonable expansion of our efforts and makes the important transition to permanent HIV/AIDS relief. I urge my colleagues to support this investment in the health of our global community and in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>

FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 2 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7601) is amended by adding at the end the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(29) The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose a major threat to the health of the global community, from the most severely-affected regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, to the emerging epidemics of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(30) According to UNAIDS' 2007 global estimates, there are 33.2 million individuals with HIV/AIDS worldwide, including 2.5 million people newly-infected with HIV. Of those infected with HIV, 2.5 million are children under 15 who also account for 460,000 of the newly-infected individuals.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(31) Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region most affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. More than 68 percent of adults and nearly 90 percent of children with HIV/AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 76 percent of AIDS deaths in 2007 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(32) Although sub-Saharan Africa carries the heaviest disease burden of HIV/AIDS, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to affect virtually every world region. While prevalence rates are relatively low in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America, without effective prevention strategies, HIV prevalence rates could rise quickly in these regions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(33) By world region, according to UNAIDS' 2007 global estimates--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) in sub-Saharan Africa, there were 22.5 million adults and children infected with HIV, up from 20.9 million in 2001, with 1.7 million new HIV infections, a 5 percent prevalence rate, and 1.6 million deaths;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) in South and Southeast Asia, there were 4 million adults and children infected with HIV, up from 3.5 million in 2001, with 340,000 new HIV infections, a 0.3 percent prevalence rate, and 270,000 deaths;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) in East Asia, there were 800,000 adults and children infected with HIV, up from 420,000 in 2001, with 92,000 new HIV infections, a 0.1 percent prevalence rate, and 32,000 deaths;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) in Eastern and Central Europe, there were 1.6 million adults and children infected with HIV, up from 630,000 in 2001, with 150,000 new HIV infections, a 0.9 percent prevalence rate, and 55,000 deaths; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) in the Caribbean, there were 230,000 adults and children infected with HIV, up from 190,000 in 2001, with 17,000 new HIV infections, a 1 percent prevalence rate, and 11,000 deaths.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(34) Tuberculosis is the number one killer of individuals with HIV/AIDS and is responsible for up to one-half of HIV/AIDS deaths in Africa.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(35) The wide extent of drug resistant tuberculosis, including both multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), driven by the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, has hampered both HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis treatment services. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the prevalence of tuberculosis to be at emergency levels in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(36) Forty percent of the world's population, mostly poor, live in malarial zones, and malaria, which is highly preventable, kills more than 1 million individuals worldwide each year. Ninety percent of malaria's victims are in sub-Saharan Africa and 70 percent of malaria's victims are children under the age of 5. Additionally, hunger and malnutrition kill another 6 million individuals worldwide each year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(37) Assistance to combat HIV/AIDS must address the nutritional factors associated with the disease in order to be effective and sustainable. The World Food Program estimates that 6.4 million individuals affected by HIV will need nutritional support by 2008.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(38) Women and girls continue to be vulnerable to HIV, in large part, due to gender-based cultural norms that leave many women and girls powerless to negotiate social relationships.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(39) Women make up 50 percent of individuals infected with HIV worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV/AIDS epidemic is most severe, women make up 57 percent of individuals infected with HIV, and 75 percent of young people infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa are young women ages 15 to 24.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(40) Women and girls are biologically, socially, and economically more vulnerable to HIV infection. Gender disparities in the rate of HIV infection are the result of a number of factors, including the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) Cross-generational sex with older men who are more likely to be infected with HIV, and a lack of choice regarding when and whom to marry, leading to early marriages and high rates of child marriages with older men. About one-half of all adolescent females in sub-Saharan Africa and two-thirds of adolescent females in Asia are married by age 18.</chair>
  <chair> "(B) Studies show that married women and married and unmarried girls often are unable or find it difficult to negotiate the frequency and timing of sexual intercourse, ensure their partner's faithfulness, or insist on condom use. Under these circumstances, women often run the risk of being infected by husbands or male partners in societies where men in relationships have more than one partner. Behavior change is particularly important in societies in which this is a common practice. &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H1922]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</chair>
  <chair> "(C) Because young married women and girls are more likely to have unprotected sex and have more frequent sex than their unmarried peers, and women and girls who are faithful to their spouses can be placed at risk of HIV/AIDS through a husband's infidelity or prior infection, marriage is not always a guarantee against HIV infection, although it is a protective factor overall.</chair>
  <chair> "(D) Social and economic inequalities based largely on gender limit access for women and girls to education and employment opportunities and prevent them from asserting their inheritance and property rights. For many women, a lack of independent economic means combines with socio-cultural practices to sustain and exacerbate their fear of abandonment, eviction, or ostracism from their homes and communities and can leave many more women trapped within relationships where they are vulnerable to  HIV infection.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) A lack of educational opportunities for women and girls is linked to younger sexual debut, earlier childhood marriage, earlier childbearing, decreased child survival, worsening nutrition, and increased risk of HIV infection.</chair>
  <chair> "(F) High rates of gender-based violence, rape, and sexual coercion within and outside marriage contribute to high rates of HIV infection. According to the World Health Organization, between one-sixth and three-quarters of women in various countries and settings have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence since the age of 15 within or outside of marriage. Women who are unable to protect themselves from such violence are often unable to protect themselves from being infected with  HIV through forced sexual contact.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(G) Fear of domestic violence and the continuing stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS prevent many women from accessing information about HIV/AIDS, getting tested, disclosing their HIV status, accessing services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, or receiving treatment and counseling even when they already know they have been infected with HIV.</chair>
  <chair> "(H) According to UNAIDS, the vulnerability of individuals involved in commercial sex acts to HIV infection is heightened by stigmatization and marginalization, limited economic options, limited access to health, social, and legal services, limited access to information and prevention means, gender-related differences and inequalities, sexual exploitation and trafficking, harmful or non-protective laws and policies, and exposure to risks associated with commercial sex acts, such as violence,  substance abuse, and increased mobility.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(I) Lack of access to basic HIV prevention information and education and lack of coordination with existing primary health care to reduce stigma and maximize coverage.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(J) Lack of access to currently available female-controlled HIV prevention methods, such as the female condom, and lack of training on proper use of either male or female condoms.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(K) High rates of other sexually transmitted infections and complications during pregnancies and childbirth.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(L) An absence of functioning legal frameworks to protect women and girls and, where such frameworks exist, the lack of accountable and effective enforcement of such frameworks.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(41) In addition to vulnerabilities to HIV infection, women in sub-Saharan Africa face a 1-in-13 chance of dying in childbirth compared to a 1-in-16 chance in least-developed countries worldwide, a 1-in-60 chance in developing countries, and a 1-in-4,100 chance in developed countries.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(42) Due to these high maternal mortality rates and high HIV prevalence rates in certain countries, special attention is needed in these countries to help HIV-positive women safely deliver healthy babies and save women's lives.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(43) Unprotected sex within or outside of marriage is the single greatest factor in the transmission of HIV worldwide and is responsible for 80 percent of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(44) Multiple randomized controlled trials have established that male circumcision reduces a man's risk of contracting HIV by 60 percent or more. Twelve acceptability studies have found that in regions of sub-Saharan Africa where circumcision is not traditionally practiced, a majority of men want the procedure. Broader availability of male circumcision services could prevent millions of HIV infections not only in men but also in their female partners.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(45)(A) Youth also face particular challenges in receiving services for HIV/AIDS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) Nearly one-half of all orphans who have lost one parent and two-thirds of those who have lost both parents are ages 12 to 17. These orphans are in particular need of services to protect themselves against sexually-transmitted infections, including HIV.</chair>
  <chair> "(C) Research indicates that many youth benefit from full disclosure of medically accurate, age-appropriate information about abstinence, partner reduction, and condoms. Providing comprehensive information about HIV, including delay of sexual debut and the ABC model: `Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms', and linking such information to health care can help improve awareness of safe sex practices and address the fact that only 1 in 3 young men and 1 in 5 young women ages 15 to 24 can correctly  identify ways to prevent HIV infection.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) Surveys indicate that no country has succeeded in fully educating more than one-half of its youth about the prevention and transmission of HIV.</chair>
  <chair> "(46) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), HIV/AIDS prevalence rates among refugees are generally lower than the HIV/AIDS prevalence rates for their host communities, though perceptions run counter to this fact. However, peacekeeping operations that no longer deploy HIV/AIDS-positive troops still face vulnerabilities to sexual transmission of HIV with HIV-positive individuals in refugee camps. Host countries generally do not provide HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment,  and care services for refugees.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(47) Continuing progress to reach the millions of impoverished individuals who need voluntary testing, counseling, treatment, and care for HIV/AIDS requires increased efforts to strengthen health care delivery systems and infrastructure, rebuild and expand the health care workforce, and strengthen allied and support services in countries receiving United States global HIV/AIDS assistance.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(48) While HIV/AIDS poses the greatest health threat of modern times, it also poses the greatest development challenge for developing countries with fragile economies and weak public financial management systems that are ill equipped to shoulder the burden of this disease. International donors will have to play a critical role in providing resources for HIV/AIDS programs far into the future.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(49) The emerging partnerships between countries most affected by HIV/AIDS and the United States must include stronger coordination between HIV/AIDS programs and other United States foreign assistance programs, and stronger collaboration with other donors in the areas of economic development and growth strategies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(50) The future control of HIV/AIDS demands coordination between international organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNAIDS, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the international donor community, national governments, and private sector organizations, including community and faith-based organizations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(51) The future control of HIV/AIDS further requires effective and transparent public finance management systems in developing countries to advance the ability of such countries to manage public revenues and donor funds aimed at combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(52) The HIV/AIDS pandemic contributes to the shortage of health care personnel through loss of life and illness, unsafe working conditions, increased workloads for diminished staff, and resulting stress and burnout, while the shortage of health care personnel undermines efforts to prevent and provide care and treatment for individuals with HIV/AIDS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(53) The shortage of health care personnel, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, counselors, laboratory staff, paraprofessionals, trained lay workers, and researchers is one of the leading obstacles to combating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(54) Since 2003, important progress has been made in combating HIV/AIDS, yet there is more to be done. The number of new HIV infections is still increasing at an alarming rate. According to the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, globally, for every 1 individual put on antiretroviral therapy, 6 individuals are newly infected with HIV.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(55) The United States Government continues to be the world's leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS and the unsurpassed partner with developing countries in their efforts to control this disease.</chair>
  <chair> "(56) By September 2007, the United States, through the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.), had provided services to prevent mother-to-child-transmission of HIV to women during 10 million pregnancies; provided antiretroviral prophylaxis for women during over 827,300 pregnancies; prevented an estimated 157,240 HIV infections in infants; cared for over 6.6 million individuals, including over 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable  children; supported lifesaving antiretroviral therapies for approximately 1.4 million men, women, and children in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Carribean; and provided counseling and testing to over 33.7 million men, women, and children in developing countries.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(57) These numbers were achieved because of the commitment of substantial resources and support of the United States Government to our partners on the front lines--the dedicated and committed women and men, communities, and nations who are taking control of the HIV/AIDS epidemics in their own countries.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to rise dealing with the underlying legislation that contains an important section to address barriers that might limit the start of and adherence to treatment services. This section also encourages direct linkages between the efforts to treat HIV/AIDS, nutrition and income security programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the chairman and ranking member for the work that they have done bringing this together, and the recognition that dealing with HIV-AIDS must be done in a holistic fashion that treats the entire person and their environment, not just the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a very personal connection to this legislation now that was not present when I first started working on issues of water for the poor now that I have a daughter working in Mozambique in the Peace Corps who is dealing with these problems on a day-to-day basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This direct amendment would add safe drinking water to nutrition and income security on the list of programs for which direct linkages are encouraged. This is an important tribute to our late colleagues, Chairman Lantos and Chairman Hyde, who were so instrumental in the enactment of our Water for the Poor Act, and their insights that are bringing safe drinking is an important component of developmental sectors from health to the environment. To include safe drinking water in legislation through  which we honor their memories is a small testament to their lasting legacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Including safe drinking water is critical because we cannot treat HIV/AIDS without safe drinking water. USAID has recognized in its guidance for missions carrying out these programs that people with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk for diarrheal diseases and far more likely to suffer severe and chronic complications if infected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is terrible irony in providing patients with advanced antiretroviral agents, and then asking them to use the water in a glass that may infect them with a life-threatening illness to wash down the life-saving pills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To add irony, one of the complications of diarrheal illnesses is HIV-infected patients have a reduced ability to absorb antiretroviral and other medications from the gut. This poor absorption can contribute to the development of HIV strains that are resistant. In addition to the negative impact on life expectancy and quality of life, they also add significantly to the burdens on caregivers in clinics and at home and put them and other family members at risk for infection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all a part of this in the global community. This legislation is important to tie these challenges together, not deal with it piecemeal, and to help with advancing the overall objective of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I support Mr. Blumenauer's amendment, which would add safe drinking water to nutrition and income security on the list of programs for which direct linkages are encouraged. For patients whose immune systems have been compromised by AIDS, the availability of safe, clean drinking water is vitally important. This is especially true for HIV positive women with young infants who use infant formula to avoid transmitting the virus to their babies during feeding. If the water  used in the formula is not clean, their babies are at high risk for waterborne diseases. Therefore, this amendment would allow PEPFAR to link with existing safe drinking water programs in order to provide clean water to these treatment patients.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding, and I rise to join you in supporting the gentleman's amendment. What was interesting to me was to learn, and there are many things I learned in this bill that I didn't know, but one was that about 1.2 billion people globally lack safe water to consume in the least-developed countries, and up to 90 percent of AIDS patients, 90 percent, suffer and frequently die from the chronic diarrheal diseases that the gentleman discussed. These  diseases are caused by the use of unsafe water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a compelling amendment. I join the gentlewoman in supporting it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would also like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Blumenauer's amendment to ensure that safe drinking water is a component of our HIV/AIDS strategy. Congressman  Blumenauer, the lead sponsor of the Water for the Poor Act of 2005, has been a strong advocate on this issue for years, and he was kind enough to testify about the challenge of clean water in Africa at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Global Health I chaired in May of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of that hearing, it became clear that in Africa, the region hardest hit by the AIDS pandemic, the problem of safe water is particularly acute. The total number of people without access to potable water in the region has actually increased by 60 million in the past half decade. That is why Mr. Blumenauer and I, along with other Members of Congress, successfully secured $300 million for safe drinking water and sanitation projects for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that HIV compromises the immune system. Those infected with the disease are far more likely to succumb to the illness caused by unsafe drinking water, especially if they are children, and there is no way that people can take ARVs if they do not have access to clean drinking water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support Mr. Blumenauer's amendment, and thank him for his cosponsorship of <bill type="hr" number="318">H. Res. 318</bill>, supporting the goals of the United Nations International Year of Sanitation. His resolution encourages international communities to achieve the target of halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. I encourage my colleagues to support the Blumenauer amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Congressman Payne, your laser-like focus on this with the subcommittee, your long-term advocacy, your work on the continent, is something that I find inspirational. I look forward to working with you and partnering on these issues as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the Chair and ranking member, your willingness to include this is important, and our work together to be able to focus on the whole person and to be able to deal with waterborne disease, the number one preventible cause of death and disease around the world. Half the people who are sick today anywhere in the world are sick needlessly from water-borne disease. Adding this critical amendment to your important legislation is an important step forward. I hope it is just one step that we can work  on together to bring people around the world to support this critical priority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, I have been involved extensively in the issues before us today. I really do appreciate the bipartisan cooperation that has guided this process, particularly by Chairman Berman and our ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you. This bill is appropriately named for two giants of this institution, Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment addresses the issue of transparency and accountability in the Global Fund. The Global Fund is a unique, non-governmental multilateral organization headquartered in Switzerland and focused on combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria throughout the developing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Government is the single largest provider of resources and technical assistance to the Global Fund, and since 2001 Congress has appropriated nearly $4 billion to the Fund. The Lantos-Hyde bill before us today authorizes additional funds that will total in the billions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill currently and appropriately calls for systematic assessments of performance data of principal recipients and subrecipients of funds, as recommended by the Government Accountability Office, the GAO. This technical amendment simply clarifies that audits by the Fund's Inspector General should also encompass principal recipients and subrecipients, the entities that actually receive programmatic funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I believe that this amendment strengthens the spirit of accountability that is present in the underlying bill. According to a June 2005 report by the GAO, the Global Fund possessed a limited ability to monitor and evaluate grants. Concerns have also been raised that the volume of funding provided through the Global Fund may exceed the capacity of the recipients in the field to actually utilize it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since we are considering an additional contribution that may total in the billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to the Global Fund over the life of this reauthorization, I believe that it would be beneficial for ourselves, as well as for the Fund, as well as for other donors, to have additional clarity on how these funds are being used in the field for those most in need of our assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I intend to support the overall bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the gentleman's amendment, and I have spoken to him about it, encourages the Global Fund Inspector General to not only audit its grantees, but also the subgrantees and subrecipients who receive Global Fund money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, I share the gentleman's concern that transparency and accountability in the use of HIV/AIDS assistance provided through the Global Fund is critically important for all the reasons that he stated. The Global Fund, in all fairness, I do want to point out, has shown, I believe, its commitment to that transparency and accountability. It has a new inspector general, and has instituted an enhanced accounting system that focuses on improving accountability among subrecipients. But the principle  of this amendment makes sense. While there are some technical issues I will want to talk to him about as we move through the legislative process, I look forward to working with him on it and I certainly urge the adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 1 minute to the gentlelady from Florida, the ranking member.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I also support Mr. Fortenberry's amendment which would ensure that audits by the Global Fund Inspector General include information on subcontractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. government is the largest contributor to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Since the fund was created, the U.S.  has appropriated and pledged $3.5 billion for contributions to the Global Fund, representing nearly one-third of the total budget of the Global Fund. It is an important component to the world's response to these three diseases, and has made progress on issues of transparency and accountability in recent  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the bill makes clear, continued support to the Global Fund should be based on the Fund's ability to meet certain transparency and accountability benchmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment builds on and clarifies the underlying text in order to ensure that the audits conducted by the Global Fund's Office of Inspector General cover both primary recipients of grant funding and subrecipients who perform smaller pieces of the grants. These audits are important. I thank the gentleman for the time, and I support the Fortenberry amendment on Inspector General audits at the Global Fund.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to speak on the amendment offered by Mr. Fortenberry. We appreciate the work that he does on the subcommittee and he contributes greatly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We feel that the Inspector General has been doing an adequate job; however, we do not oppose this amendment. The Office has approved over $10 billion for programs in 136 countries around the world so far, which amounts to 21 percent of all donor HIV/AIDS spending, and two-thirds of all the donor spending on malaria and tuberculosis. Through the Global Fund, 1.4 million people have been treated with life-saving antivirals, 3.3 million cases of TB have been treated; and, in a new area, 46 million  bed nets have been distributed to protect children against malaria. And I am pleased to say that Ray Chambers from New Jersey and my congressional district has been appointed ambassador for the U.N. to combat malaria.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the amendment offered by Mr. Jackson of Illinois and myself would add three Southern African countries, Malawi, Swaziland, and Lesotho, to the lists of countries that will be a part of the focus countries in the reauthorization of this Global HIV/AIDS legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the original PEPFAR legislation designated 14 focus countries. These countries were prioritized for intensive investment of resources and technical expertise as provided through PEPFAR. The bill on the floor today adds focus countries by designating Vietnam and 14 Caribbean basic countries with PEPFAR focus status. Unfortunately, these three countries in Southern Africa, each confronting devastation as a result of HIV/AIDS, have not been granted priority status in PEPFAR. The crisis  of HIV/AIDS confronting Malawi, Swaziland, and Lesotho is real and in some cases worse than the existing focus countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malawi is a country of 13 million people, with 900,000 children orphaned by AIDS and nearly 1 million of its adults living with HIV, a 14 percent infection rate. Swaziland, with a population of only 1.1 million people, has over 200,000 adults living with HIV, one in three adults, or a 33 percent adult infection rate. Lesotho has a population of 2 million people, and an HIV infection rate among its adults of 23 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These three countries are not only confronting HIV and AIDS, but they are also among the poorest countries on the planet, which makes their challenge so much greater. Malawi, for example, is 164th out of 177 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index. Also, each country is geographically surrounded by countries that were designated focus countries in the original PEPFAR legislation, South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania, which are presently receiving massive investments to confront  their epidemics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malawi, Swaziland and Lesotho are working bilaterally with the United States; but by not being granted PEPFAR's focus country status, the gap that they face between the needs and available resources means that too many people will continue to be infected, too many people will continue to die needlessly, and too many orphans will be left to fend for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment has the support of the governments of Malawi, Swaziland and Lesotho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit for the Record a letter of support from the three governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 28, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR HONOURABLE MCCOLLUM, we are writing to follow up on our recent meeting during which we discussed, among other things, the re-authorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are deeply concerned that the three countries that have been heavily impacted by the HIV/AIDS virus in Southern Africa, and whose prevalence rates are above 14% have been left out from the new list of focus countries as reflected in <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>. Our countries have become islands amidst countries that are receiving tremendous resources from PEPFAR within the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AIDS epidemic in our countries has brought additional pressure to bear on the health sector. We are failing to train adequate number of health workers to provide services to those living with HIV and suffering from AIDS. The few that we have trained have died from the virus while others have left the continent for greener pastures in the western countries. Although the recent increase in the provision of ARV has brought hope to many, it has also put increased strain on the remaining healthcare  workers. In addition, there are many more people living with the HIV virus who are not receiving treatment due to lack of resources to purchase drugs and to train personnel to administer treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The presence of AIDS has also affected many households. Many children have lost one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, we have a large number of children who were born with the virus because the risk of mother-to-child transmission remains very high. Although we have put in place orphan care programs, the need for more resources to provide comprehensive care cannot be overemphasized. The pandemic has also added strain to the food insecurity in many areas because agricultural work  has been neglected or abandoned due to household illness. The labor force, in general, has also been affected by HIV/AIDS, setting back economic and social progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our leadership is highly committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS. Our governments have provided enough domestic resources within their means and are receiving external funding for HIV/AIDS programs. However, there is a wide funding gap between planned programs and resources required for implementation. It is for this reason that we humbly request you to introduce an amendment to <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, to include Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland as focus countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your assistance on this matter will be greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yours sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hawa Olga Ndilowe,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ambassador of Malawi to the U.S. &lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>

    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charge d'Affaires, Embassy of the Kingdom of Lesotho to the U.S. &lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These countries believe, as I do, that the severity of the epidemic in their countries should make their fight against AIDS a priority for this Congress and for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their commitment for fighting HIV/AIDS, and for their hard work in bringing <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also had the honor of serving on the International Relations Committee under the leadership of Mr. Hyde and Mr. Lantos when we passed the original PEPFAR legislation. They were both extraordinary men and wonderful mentors to me. They were compassionate leaders in this House, and it is fitting that we pay tribute to their lives and their contributions to this country by passing a bill that will save lives and improve life all around the world. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to  be included in the bill, and also to support passage of this important bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I actually support the McCollum-Jackson amendment, which would add Malawi, Swaziland and Lesotho to the list of countries in which the Global AIDS Coordinator is given explicit statutory authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malawi, Swaziland, and Lesotho all face major HIV/AIDS epidemics and have received significant resources through PEPFAR in the first 5 years of implementation. By giving the Global AIDS Coordinator explicit authority over the U.S. Government's HIV/AIDS programs in these countries, the Congress is signaling that it believes the U.S. Government should continue to come alongside these nations' governments and their citizens to support them in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and I commend Ms. McCollum  and Mr. Jackson for offering it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentlelady from Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Southern Africa has the highest rate of HIV and AIDS in the entire world. In Lesotho, we have heard, a country with an HIV/AIDS prevalence rate of 38 percent among pregnant women, only 19 percent of those in need of treatment for the disease have access for it. Even more troubling is the fact that only 5 percent of HIV-positive mothers get drugs to prevent the transmission of the virus to their children during childbirth. Life expectancy for women is 44 years, and for men a mere 39.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Malawi, the situation is a little better; men are expected to live 41 years, women 42. The health care worker shortage in the country remains a major obstacle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Circumstances in Swaziland are equally grim: 26 percent of adults are HIV positive. In a country of just over 1 million, there are 70,000 AIDS orphans. Clearly, HIV and AIDS pose a dire threat in these countries and must be urgently addressed. Therefore, I commend the gentlewoman, Ms. McCollum, for her amendment to make Swaziland, Lesotho, and Malawi focus countries, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 and to offer my amendment which I believe will enhance the base bill. I want to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their hard work in bringing this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it of coincidence the timing of our consideration of this legislation for it is juxtaposed between two pivotal historical moments in time: The deaths of the renowned African American medical doctor, Dr. Charles Drew on April 1, 1950, and the celebrated human rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Dr. Drew and Dr. King were products of the American educational system and particularly of historically black colleges and universities. Madam Chairman, I cannot think of any better way to explain the importance of this amendment and its use. The effort to address HIV/AIDS requires the best of human rights and of medical science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is a simple amendment that would make changes to section 204 of <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>. The amendment directs the coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally and the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to expand their plan for strengthening health systems of host countries by allowing for African post secondary educational institutions to collaborate with United States post secondary educational institutions and specifically  historically black colleges and universities to develop such human and institutional capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of my amendment is to allow our Nation's finest post secondary educational institutions to be directly involved in the training of health care workers that will enhance the effectiveness and efficacy of the efforts put forth in <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I can think of no better way for the citizens of Indiana, the great Hoosier State, to contribute  in the fight against this pandemic than to train the best and brightest, and to commit to countries whose health care systems suffer woefully from the lack of trained health professionals. After all, who are we to block the opportunity to these children to be successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, before I close, I want to acknowledge and salute the two men this piece of legislation is named after, Congressmen Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde. I didn't get a chance to work with them in this body, but I cannot think of a better way to honor their service in this great institution.</paragraph>

We all had the honor of serving with his grandmother, Julia Carson, for many years in this body, and I know that Congresswoman Carson is looking down at her grandson and saying she is mighty proud. So thank you so much for your amendment, and thank you for carrying on in her great legacy by presenting wonderful topics and themes for us to discuss on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully support the Carson amendment because it focuses on building human and institutional capacity in PEPFAR host countries. It directs the global AIDS coordinator and the USAID administrator to expand their plan by strengthening health systems of host countries by encouraging post secondary educational institutions, particularly those in the African continent, to collaborate with the post secondary educational institutions here in the United States, including historically black colleges and  universities in training health care workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As other provisions of this bill made clear, an important component of the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, is the strengthening of the educational capacity in host countries to train health care workers. The Carson amendment does exactly that. I congratulate him for it. He is a welcome addition to our Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to yield to Ms. Lee of California who has been working on this issue for a long time, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to support this amendment and to commend the gentleman from Indiana. I understand this is his first amendment, and it shows that he has hit the ground running. Today, I am reminded of our former colleague, his grandmother, our beloved Congresswoman Julia Carson. I know she is smiling today and is very proud of your efforts; thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically black colleges and universities have trained some of our finest dedicated doctors, nurses and health care workers. These colleges and universities go way beyond the call of duty. They have a deep cultural and historical understanding and connection to the continent of Africa. They are attacking HIV/AIDS here on the homefront where HIV and AIDS is disproportionately affecting the African-American community. So by developing human and institutional capacity in Africa and in the Caribbean,  we are bringing to bear, in a comprehensive manner, mechanisms to maximize our effectiveness in combating HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to salute and thank the gentleman from Indiana once again for his leadership and for helping to strengthen this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentlelady, the ranking member, yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of the Carson amendment relating to the building of human capacity to fight HIV/AIDS through collaborations between U.S. colleges and universities and those in the developing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, am very pleased to see this piece of legislation by Mr. Carson. We all knew Julia Carson. She came to my district to deal with health disparities in my district in New Jersey, and traveled to Africa with me on a trip dealing with this problem. So this is very appropriate, and let me commend you again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May of 2007, Doctors Without Borders released a report that found that in southern Africa, a shortage of trained health care workers was the main barrier to increasing access to antiretroviral treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report found that in Mozambique, people had to wait up to 2 months to start ARVs because there were not enough doctors and nurses to manage it. In one health district in Lesotho, nearly half of the nursing posts were vacant. Malawi has only two doctors per 100,000 people. The minimum standard according to the WHO is 20 doctors per 100,000 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to say that the bill under consideration seeks to address those problems. It calls on the United States to train 140,000 new health care workers and professionals so people can start on life-saving therapy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>University partnerships are a logical and effective means through which to support this goal. So I once again commend Mr. Carson for his amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <chair> Under the rule, the Committee rises.</chair>
  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Ross) having assumed the chair, Ms. Norton, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill>) to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 1065, she  reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.</chair>
  <chair>The amendments were agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> to the Committee on Foreign Affairs with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendments:</narrative>
  <narrative>Page 96, line 10, strike "$4,000,000,000" and insert "such sums as may be necessary".</narrative>
  <narrative>Page 97, line 1, strike "$5,000,000,000" and insert "such sums as may be necessary".</narrative>
  <narrative>Page 116, line 8, strike "$10,000,000,000" and insert "6,000,000,000".</narrative>
  <narrative>Page 122, after line 2, insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, $50 billion to carry out the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 would not be spent during the five-year authorization period, but instead would take 10 years or until 2018 to spend.</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) Recent funding disbursement trends for the current program suggest that the current funding levels are outpacing the capacity of the countries and nongovernmental organizations to efficiently implement the program. Over the 2005-2006 funding period, assistance commitments grew $1.3 billion from $4.3 billion to $5.6 billion, while the actual disbursements of funds grew at a much slower rate of $400 million from $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion. As such, the current commitment exceeds disbursement  by $1.7 billion, or 30 percent of the current commitment.</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) Reports from recipient countries indicate the absorptive capacity for HIV/AIDS programs has become a constraint on actual expenditure of funds. For instance, a 2005 survey of World Bank Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) country directors in Africa found that nearly 40 percent of those countries believed that absorptive capacity "remains limited and is the real issue; new financial resources will exacerbate this problem".</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) Additionally, a 2007 Center for Global Development report on HIV/AIDS programs in Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia found that overburdened government staff at all levels, along with the  limited absorptive capacity of sub-grantees, created major bottlenecks for funding disbursement.</narrative>
  <narrative>(5) Advocates of increased HIV/AIDS funding appear to have based their recommendations for such funding at least in part on UNAIDS' estimates of a global price tag for addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Such international estimates are flawed, however, because the primary source for such projections--the UNAIDS' "Resource Needs Model", or RNM--overestimates the resources needed, relies on a higher estimate of people living with HIV/AIDS, and includes support for countries that are also Global  Fund donors. Specifically:</narrative>
  <narrative>(A) The UNAIDS report titled "Critical Review of Costing Models to Estimate Resource Needs to Address Global HIV and AIDS" found that "the [RNM] has a number of limitations", each of which contributes to an overestimate of the resources needed to mount a successful response.</narrative>
  <narrative>(B) Newer projections such as the 2007 "Epidemic Update" lowered the estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide from 39.5 million to 33.2 million--a 16 percent reduction--yet UNAIDS has not publicly released a revised lower projection of resource needs.</narrative>
  <narrative>(C) Projections in the RNM report include significant financing for middle-income countries such as China, Russia, and Brazil that are actually Global Fund donors themselves and should not require international assistance.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings contained in subsection (a), which indicate that even current levels of funding for HIV/AIDS programs cannot be disbursed in an efficient and effective manner, Congress should ensure that the amount of funding authorized by this Act to carry out the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 is consistent with the demonstrated absorptive capacity to carry out such programs around the world.</narrative>
  <chair> Without objection, the reading is dispensed with.</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by complimenting the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee, along with all the other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for working in a bipartisan way to put together this compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard a very good fulfilling debate about the merits of PEPFAR. I, too, agree that the PEPFAR program is a very worthwhile program. So we agree that this is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, should we more than double the authorization of this program? Now, the President's budget called for doing just that. And I think you can make a very good and compelling case that this program is so successful that it ought to be doubled. That's not what the underlying bill does. This underlying bill more than triples this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have three concerns about this tripling of this program. Number 1, the spending levels set out in this authorization bill are higher than the recipient countries can even accept. They can't absorb all of this money. We know this from the studies in the field. So even if we hit these authorization levels, we know that the recipient countries cannot even accept all of this money. They can't spend it that fast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Point Number 2, the Congressional Budget Office has told us that we couldn't even spend this money this fast. So why are we having this kind of an authorization level when our own Congressional Budget Office is telling us that it would take at least 10 years to spend down a $50 billion authorization?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that brings me to my third point, and that is the budget resolution that passed the floor just 2 1/2  weeks ago. The Democratic budget resolution itself assumes the $30 billion level. The Democratic budget resolution assumes we're funding this at the President's request of $30 billion. In fact, the Democratic budget resolution has a lower level of funding for section 150, the Foreign Affairs program, than even the President's budget does. We don't know what cut they're talking about, but  more to the point, why don't we defend the budget resolution that passed this very house 2 1/2  weeks ago?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we support this program. I support this program. It's a good program. It has proven to work. By any metric, by any definition, it's impossible to deny the success of PEPFAR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, should we be tripling a program when we know full well it breaks the budget resolution, it purports to spend money faster than we can even spend, and those who are receiving this money can't receive it nearly as fast as we're proposing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This recommit is not intended to kill this bill. This is a forthwith recommit. This recommit is very simple. It says, rather than funding it at $50 billion, let's fund it at $30 billion. That's the level called for on the Democratic budget resolution. That's the level called for in the President's budget. That's the level that independent experts have said can be justified. So this says go from 50 to 30 forthwith, that's all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to compliment the gentleman, the chairman of the committee, the ranking member of the committee, all of those who worked in a bipartisan basis for this very worthwhile program, but this is a time when we have fiscal problems in America. We have a deficit. We have a looming debt. We need to show discipline in Congress. We should not be tripling funding for programs that we know the recipients themselves cannot receive at this pace and we know from our own independent budget experts that  we simply can't spend at this pace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's bring it back down to earth. Let's double it and keep it within reason. That is why we should pass this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I appreciate the compliments of my friend from Wisconsin. I prefer that the compliments be withheld and the motion to slash this bill by 40 percent be rejected, although I do appreciate the implication of his comments that a recommittal motion that is forthwith is not intended to kill the bill and that, therefore, the recommittal motions that are not forthwith are intended to kill the bills they are made to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But getting to the merits of this. The purpose of my comments is directly to the other side. I know the easy vote, even for those who support this bill, is to vote both to cut some money and to support the minority on their motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to suggest that in this particular case, given what has transpired in terms of putting together this bipartisan bill, both on the merits of the motion to recommit and on the message it sends about how we can work on a bipartisan basis in the future, this motion is wrong and that Members on the other side should oppose it along with the Members on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, on the facts. The administration supports this bill and supports our number on this bill. To the extent they have concerns about what the level of appropriations may be in this year, their statement of administration position directly says, talk about the level of appropriation; don't cut the authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the U.N. HIV/AIDS commission, which I'm not a fan of a lot of different agencies that start with "U.N.," but this one is the preeminent authority, talks about the incredible remaining need. And in the issue of absorptive capacity, this was the same argument made in 2003 against a $15 billion authorization for which the Republican Congress appropriated far more than the authorization because we were able to see an absorptive capacity, and we saved well over a million lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here we are dealing with a situation where there are 35 million people worldwide that are still living with HIV/AIDS. This is a program that works. The combination of changing behavior, prevention, and treatment is saving lives. I don't like to throw the words "moral imperative" around. It's usually used for anything people feel passionately about. But talk about pro-life, I can't think of any single program that I have been involved with where we are going to be more pro-life than in pushing  this with programs that work, with the capacity that can be absorbed. No one is saying we are going to spend $50 billion in the next 5 years. We are going to obligate, based on the appropriation moneys, and those moneys will be spent probably over the course of 8 to 10 years. That's the way this appropriation process works, as everyone knows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My final point is the ranking member and I, the White House directly, the President and his chief of staff were directly involved, the Republican leadership in this body, we put together a bipartisan bill. Part of the key negotiation was about the number. In return for that, a number of issues of importance to the minority were preserved in this bill: the preservation of the concept of behavior change through abstinence and faithfulness; the understanding that approved family planning programs  would be the ones that were funded. A variety of different aspects. The belief in the use of faith-based institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How are we, in the future, going to come together on bipartisan programs where the deal is made and then all of a sudden a key part of the quid pro quo, the other side says "no" to?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest, sure there are issues about what is our fiscal condition and what can we do, and the appropriations could be weighing these very carefully. But this was a fundamental agreement to maintain a bipartisan tradition on this legislation named after Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos, both of whom worked in that capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this motion to recommit massively undercuts that whole bipartisan approach, and I would urge my colleagues to defeat it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.</paragraph>
