    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize several young people who were recently selected by the American Automobile Association to receive special awards for their work as school safety patrollers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 560,000 students in 52,000 schools across the country participate in AAA's School Safety Patrol Program. These young people have taken on the important responsibility of making the streets around their schools safer for their classmates. Though their responsibilities are often routine, the patrollers on occasion must place themselves in harm's way in order to save lives. It is my honor today to recognize two students who were selected to receive the AAA Lifesaver Award for their selfless  and heroic actions in fulfilling their duties as patrollers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taylor Pitzer and Caleb Jarrell participate in the AAA School Safety Patrol Program at Southdale Elementary in Kettering, OH. On November 8, 2006, Taylor and Caleb pulled a younger child to safety when a speeding van ran the red light at the intersection they were patrolling. The younger child was watching carefully for the "walk" signal. When the light changed, she began crossing the street and did not notice the oncoming vehicle approaching the intersection.

    <paragraph>I would also like to thank AAA for making the school safety program possible. This program has helped save many lives over the years and has made our schools safer for our students, though, as the story of the Life Saver Award recipients demonstrate, the streets around our schools are not safe enough. That is why I worked to create the national Safe Routes to School Program, which was adopted as part of the Federal transportation bill on July 29, 2005. Funds for this program can help communities  construct new bike lanes, pathways, and sidewalks, as well as launch Safe Routes education and promotion campaigns in elementary and middle schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to commend this important program today before the Senate. I know I speak for every member of the Senate in expressing our gratitude for their valuable work in our communities.</paragraph>
