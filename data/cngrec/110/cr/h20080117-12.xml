    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Korean American Day, which was held this past Sunday to honor the achievements, to honor the contributions of Korean Americans to our country. Back on January 13 of 1903, the first Korean immigrants came here to the United States; and since that time, Korean Americans have taken root and thrived in this country through their strong ties, their hard work, their commitment to their rich heritage and values, education, and entrepreneurship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Madam Speaker, we have an ally and friend in South Korea, and they have been a friend for the decades. Over this time, South Korea has emerged as a major economic power, our seventh largest trading partner. It is vital that Congress take up and pass the Korean-U.S. trade agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you why: this particular agreement, the U.S. International Trade Commission, just released its report. They say this agreement can benefit the economy of the United States of America to the tune of over $10 billion, between $10 billion and $11.9 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We stand to gain if this passes. It's vital that we continue to open up new markets for our goods and services. This agreement accomplishes that.</paragraph>
