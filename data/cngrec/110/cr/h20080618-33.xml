  <narrative>AMERICA NEEDS ENERGY PRODUCTION -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5489]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know after listening to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if you listen to their prescription for our energy woes, it is very much like saying we can have milk in this country without cows. They don't understand that in order to take care of the problem, you need supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And why do I say that, because on every single vote we have had over the last decade or so, when we talked about tar sands, Democrats voted no. When we talked about shale oil, Democrats voted no. When we talked about coal, Democrats voted no. When we talked about cleaner ways of using coal, the Democrats voted no. When we talked about offshore drilling for gas and oil, the Democrats said no. When we talked about drilling in ANWR, they voted no. When we talked about refineries, they said no. Nuclear,  they said no. And sometimes they have even said no to wind if it happened to be near where they lived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the problem is that the American people want solutions. We are providing an opportunity for solutions. All  we are asking is that the leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle allow us to bring to the floor those bills that will allow for more American energy production because we understand if you want milk, you have to have cows. If you want production, you are going to have to allow production in this country.</paragraph>
