  <narrative>RETAIN FUNDING FOR THE COMMODITY SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12388]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, because it is taking longer than it should to complete the people's business and the Agriculture appropriations bill is getting further delayed by political wrangling, I am compelled to petition Speaker Pelosi to focus on a Federal food bank program that is very important to my Colorado district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have asked the Speaker to retain funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. This program was established in the 1960s and effectively and efficiently provides low-income elderly individuals and pregnant women basic food assistance. However, in recent years, Presidents Clinton and Bush have proposed the elimination of this program, despite the objections of many, including me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program funding was made clear to me during the August work period when I visited the Weld County Food Bank. This food bank is one of seven in Colorado that utilizes this funding, and it serves nearly 20,000 residents in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This food bank program and the Agriculture appropriations bill are vital to Colorado. Please retain funding for  this program, and do so without further delay.</paragraph>
