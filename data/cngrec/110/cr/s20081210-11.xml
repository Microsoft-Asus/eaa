  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to discuss the very important issue before the Congress this week: the proposed bailout of the three major U.S. auto manufacturers. Of course, I have looked at this issue and the proposals that have been put forward very carefully because this is such a serious issue. I have studied the draft language that was released on Monday that certainly constitutes the proposal as we have known it for the last few days. I have followed all of the discussions and ongoing  negotiations and ongoing changes to that language proposed Monday. In fact, I have offered concrete--hopefully helpful--suggestions of movements that could possibly garner my support. Based on all of that, after very careful thought and consideration, I have reached two inescapable conclusions for me. First, I cannot support</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't come to this conclusion lightly. I certainly realize that the failure of these companies, should they go under, would be devastating, first for millions of individuals and fine American families and secondly for our economy as a whole. In reaching this decision, I don't trivialize or minimize in any way the impact of that sort of failure. Certainly that has been brought home to bear in my State, particularly in northwest Louisiana. We have a significant GM plant in Shreveport. I am very  aware of the positive impact of that plant. I am very aware of the workers there, the families, the suppliers who are affected. And, of course, all across our State, I am very aware of auto dealers and other folks who are tied so closely to this industry. I oppose this bailout plan, not in spite</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That may seem a bit of an odd statement to some folks. Why do I say that? Well, for two reasons. No. 1, this proposal, at its core, is about giving these companies $15 billion of loans, $15 billion on the promise of a detailed restructuring plan yet to come. So we give them significant amounts of money--$15 billion--so that they go through that process, so that they start that discussion, so that they come back to us months later with a detailed restructuring plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, my reaction to that is pretty simple. I think the average American would say: What? Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? $15 billion, and then later, after that is out the door, we will see a detailed restructuring plan? Secondly, even more important than that, it means that the impetus, the pressure to make that restructuring truly fundamental, truly to the core, which is absolutely necessary for these companies to survive, that pressure is not nearly as great as if we held the  money until that detailed restructuring plan was presented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second reason I will vote against this bailout plan, the second reason I believe it actually would doom these companies to failure is that I believe it politicizes the management of these companies right at a time where they need to move in the opposite direction so that business and engineering considerations alone guide their company's futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say bluntly, I have no confidence--absolutely no confidence--in the present management of these three companies. But let me also say, if there is a way for that to go from bad to worse, it is by injecting into the process politics and a political appointee such as this so-called car czar. That would make a very bad situation very much worse. It would politicize further the management of these companies, again, when they need to move to a situation where business and engineering considerations  alone guide their decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another good, specific example of this politicization is language which has been in the proposal so far to actually prohibit these companies from legally challenging various moves for individual States to impose onerous, complicated, different environmental standards on them. Again, we are bringing political mandates, political pressure, political decisions to bear right at a time when these companies need to move in the opposite direction, get away from all of that, which has been a part of  the reason they are where they are today, and base their future decisions on business and engineering considerations alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these companies to survive, no matter what taxpayer dollars are involved, they need truly core fundamental restructuring. They need to revamp and revisit all their obligations, all their business models, all their labor contracts, all their dealership associations--everything that constitutes them as they presently are. They need to do that; if not in a bankruptcy process, they need to do that through a process which is the equivalent of bankruptcy, just by another name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan which is being worked on and will be presented before us is not that. What is worse, it is not only not that, I believe it will prevent that from ever happening and will, therefore, doom these companies to failure, no matter what taxpayer dollars are thrown at them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, for this reason, I have reached what is for me a clear and inescapable conclusion. No. 1, I cannot support this general bailout plan. No. 2, because I believe this plan will actually doom the companies to failure, I will use every procedural tool available to demand a fair and open amendment process on the floor of the Senate and to delay and block the measure as it presently stands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with that, I yield back the floor.</paragraph>
