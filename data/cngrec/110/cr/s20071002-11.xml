  <narrative>THE BUDGET PROCESS AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE -- (Senate - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12391">S12391</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a colleague and friend of mine on the other side of the aisle spoke a few minutes ago about the budget process. I come today to specifically talk about children's health care, but I think it is important to respond to what was said as it relates to the budget process and adopting a budget by October 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was thinking as he was speaking, I have been here now--this is my seventh year, my seventh budget process. We have never met the October 1 deadline--never. In fact, I am not sure I remember having done it in the House when I was there for 4 years, either. We all know it is a nice political argument to make on the floor of the Senate, but it has no credibility because the reality is the October 1 deadline is something that is difficult to meet and we usually work through the fall on the budget.  Everybody knows that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I think is significant, though, is the fact that if we are going to hold to that test as the test of responsible leadership, 6 of the last 7 years the Republican majority was in charge and 6 times they did not meet an October 1 deadline. In fact, last year, they never got a budget passed at all--at all. We came in as the new majority and had to pick up the pieces and figure out how to keep the Government going for the last half of the year. So I find it disingenuous--and I would say this  to my friend if he were here--to come to the floor and make great political speeches and great theater. The reality is we all on both sides of the aisle know that the appropriators are working together now, coming to the floor on a bipartisan basis, to do what we do every single year--every single year in October and November and, unfortunately, at times into December.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I am very proud of is the fact that our leader, Senator Reid, and our leadership in our caucus take very seriously our responsibilities on the budget; not only putting a budget in place, but a budget with the right values, the right priorities. We are changing the priorities on behalf of the people of this country. We are changing the priorities as they relate to funding the troops and pay raises and making sure our troops have what they need. We are changing the priorities.  We will be dealing with a bill later this week as it relates to the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations where we are going to stop the cuts the President has made in law enforcement, in the COPS program, in the FBI, and in juvenile justice and drug enforcement. We will work to reinstate that and refocus us on those things that keep our communities safe, keep America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of that. I am very proud of the priorities we have been putting in place as relates to this budget. On top of that, we are not digging a bigger hole as it relates to the deficit of this country, because we have returned to a policy that was in place under the former administration, under President Clinton, that simply says if you are going to spend dollars, you have to pay for it. You either have to cut some place in order to increase another or you have to raise revenue. It is  a basic principle. It ought to be a no-brainer. But that has been suspended in the last 6 years, creating the largest deficits in the history of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to come to the floor and talk about budgets and process, and I am very proud of the direction we are going in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very proud of what we have done as it relates to another absolutely critical priority, and that is children's health care. We have a health care system for low-income individuals called Medicaid. If you work, two parents or a mom may be working two jobs, maybe three minimum-wage jobs to try to make sure she pays the bills and has a roof over her children's heads and food on the table, chances are she is a low-income working parent, or a couple working together, a dad working for his  children. Chances are health care is going to be too expensive--just too expensive to buy in the individual market if you don't have it through the place where you work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten years ago this Congress came together in a bipartisan way under a different President to say: We want to help families who are working hard every single day, who care about their children and who are doing everything they can to do the right thing--the values we should be supporting in this country, of hard work, family, and caring about our kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to help them by putting in place a children's insurance program so that at least the children of low-income working families are able to get the health care they need. It has been a huge success. We have overwhelming support from Governors, Republicans and Democrats, and State legislatures. In fact, this is the ultimate in strange bedfellows. We have the U.S. Chamber and the business community, the labor community, health care providers, children's advocates, and consumer advocates; we  have the broadest possible group of Americans with the broadest possible interests that have come together to work with us to be able to design an extension of children's health care and, in fact, to be able to include additional children who qualify under that program for working families. We passed that on a huge bipartisan vote in this Senate--enough to override a Presidential veto. The House of Representatives passed it with a very large bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the President, we assume, will be getting this bill. There is only one thing standing between 10 million children getting health insurance in this country, the parents of 10 million children being able to sleep a little easier tonight--there is only one thing standing between that happening and those families and that is the signature of the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am here today, as colleagues on both sides of the aisle have done, to thank our leadership--Senator Reid and the bipartisan leadership of Senator Max Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Orrin Hatch, and Senator Rockefeller. They have done a magnificent job of doing what we are supposed to do: bring people's diverse interests together, develop a true compromise, and get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge this President to look deep inside his heart, take a few moments to talk to some of these families before he puts his veto on this bill. This is one of the most significant things we will do in this Congress. It is one of the most significant moments for this President. He asked us, again, to fund a war that is not paid for. For 41 days of funding of that war, we could pay for 10 million children getting health insurance over the next 5 years. This is about values and priorities. It always  has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State, I can tell you we have 90,000 children and parents--families who are waiting and hoping and praying that this President will join with all of us in doing the right thing. Too many families are struggling. Health care is skyrocketing. These same families are being squeezed on all sides. Gas prices going up, health care costs are going up, they have challenges in keeping their mortgages, and what will happen to their jobs? Will they be shipped overseas? Will they get a pay cut?  What is happening in terms of preparing to send their children to college? Middle-class families are being squeezed on all sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a group of parents who are working very hard but don't have health insurance through their job, this Congress has done the right thing by passing a children's health care bill that will say at least your children will be able to get the health insurance they need and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this President was at the Republican convention in 2004 accepting his nomination for reelection for his second term, President Bush said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for Government health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, President Bush sent to us a budget that, in fact, as he funded it, would eliminate well over a million children who currently receive  health care under the Children's Health Care Program. We have rejected that, and we have turned to see how the program was working and found there were millions more children eligible for this very same program as the economy gets tougher and tougher for families, but the funding wasn't there to make  sure those children receive children's health care as well. So we worked together, and we are now including an additional 4 million children whose families are working but have not been able to get health insurance. That, all together, equals 10 million children under the legislation we passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing more important we could do than to guarantee that children get a healthy start in life--whether it is the general practitioner they need to see, the dentist or whether they need mental health help. We have said the children of this country are a priority for our majority, for the Senate, for the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply ask today at this critical moment: President Bush, please join us and sign this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
