  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this past Friday I had the privilege of visiting the third grade classes at Brook Forest Elementary School in Oak Brook, Illinois. They gave me a wonderful and informative presentation on current efforts to protect the Mexican Grey Wolf and save it from extinction. I was impressed by their thorough research and their dedication to protecting this endangered species. They felt so strongly about it that they held a bake sale and raised $448 to donate to Chicago's Brookfield  Zoo for its wolf breeding program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend their teachers for their creativity in planning such a comprehensive and engaging curriculum. They combined lessons in science, social studies, public speaking, and environmental and civic responsibility into one challenging and complete unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to offer a big "thank you" to my new friends at Brook Forest for teaching me so much. I join them in their noble cause, and will continue to work in Congress to protect endangered species like the Mexican Grey Wolf.</paragraph>
