    <paragraph>I was going to ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of <bill type="s" number="1639">S. 1639</bill>, the immigration legislation, at a time to be determined by the majority leader following consultation with the Republican leader. However, I am advised there would be an objection from the Republican side, so I am not going to ask for that unanimous consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 208, <bill type="s" number="1639">S. 1639</bill>, and I send a cloture motion to the desk.</paragraph>
