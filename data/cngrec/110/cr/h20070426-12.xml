    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and pay tribute to the Mount Pleasant High School Wrestling Team for the 2007 North Carolina High School Athletic Association State 1-A/2-A Championship Title win.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mount Pleasant completed an impressive run to the team championship title. The overall team record for the 2006-2007 season was 31-1. The Tigers also hold the 2007 titles of Cabarrus County Champions, Rocky River Conference Regular Season and Tournament Champions, and 1-A/2-A Midwest Regional Champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This season there were nine State qualifiers and eight State place winners on the team, the most in Mount Pleasant's high school history. In the title match, Mount Pleasant recorded 135.5 points to second-place Mayodan Dalton McMichael High School's 82 points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud of the hard work, dedication and scholarship of these young men from North Carolina's Eighth District. Congratulations, Coach Greg Hinson, Coach Randy Kaiser and the Mount Pleasant High School men's wrestling team on your successful season and State championship victory. Go Tigers.</paragraph>
