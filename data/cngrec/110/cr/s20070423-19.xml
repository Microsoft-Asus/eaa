    <paragraph>Madam President, today I honor the distinguished 70-year history of the National Small Business Association. This member-driven organization continues to take the lead on important issues facing small businesses and is the oldest small business advocacy group in the United States. It is especially fitting that we recognize this organization during National Small Business Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NSBA can trace its founding back to DeWitt M. Emery, a determined small business owner struggling to keep his business running in the midst of the Great Depression. As owner of the Monroe Letterhead Corporation in Akron, OH, Mr. Emery labored to keep his small business running while feeling burdened by the increasing cost of doing business--including higher material costs and wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frustrated by the lack of support for small businesses in national politics, and inspired by an idea to make his and his peers' voices heard, Mr. Emery founded the National Small Business Men's Association on November 13, 1937. One hundred sixty small business owners out of 200 who received Mr. Emery's recruitment letter joined the organization that now boasts a reach of over 150,000 small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In keeping with the organization's responsiveness to the ever-changing small business climate, and to be more inclusive of the growing number of women small business owners, the group changed its name in 1962 to the National Small Business Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986, the organization changed its name again to National Small Business United when it joined with Small Business United, or SBU, a rival organization that started 5 years earlier. SBU and its member groups, such as the Smaller Business Association of New England, or SBANE, helped establish the current organization's vast network of small business affiliates. After the merger, the new organization became responsible for running the SBANE-created Washington Presentation. In addition to SBANE,  some of the other NSBA affiliates are the Arizona Small Business Association, the Small Business Association of Michigan, Missouri Merchants and Manufacturers Association, SMC Business Councils, Council of Smaller Enterprises and Small Business California. Thanks to its strong affiliates NSBA has emerged as a vibrant grassroots organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the oldest small business advocacy group changed its name back to the National Small Business Association. Through its name changes and merger, the organization's commitment to representing small business owners has been unwavering, and today's group boasts a wide variety of members from carpenters to investors, from manufacturers to grocers. NSBA truly represents the diversity of our Nation's small businesses. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I work  with NSBA's members in my State and across the Nation, welcoming their insights and unique perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it important to note that today's small business owners struggle with some of the same issues that plagued Mr. Emery in 1937, and many new issues. From access to capital to health care, we will continue to work with small businesses as they strive to maintain and grow their firms--and as they make a significant contribution to our economy. Through the efforts of advocacy groups like the NSBA working with us to pass legislation, we have been able to assist thousands of determined small  business owners like Mr. Emery. The tireless work of the NSBA is testament to the resolve and spirit of small business owners, and I am gratified that the current organization leads the charge on many important issues. I invite the Senate to join me in honoring NSBA and its distinguished history of nonpartisan work on behalf of small businesses.</paragraph>
