    <paragraph>Mr. President, shortly the Chair will announce that we are in morning business until 3 p.m. today, with the time equally divided between the two leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 3 p.m., the Senate will begin consideration of <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act. Senators BOXER and INHOFE are managing the bill, and they will be here at 3 o'clock ready to conduct business. There will be no rollcall votes today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there are no amendments on Tuesday, the water resources bill would be ready for a vote. If there are no votes on WRDA tomorrow and they are able to complete work on the bill, then we will have the judicial nomination before the caucuses in the morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I have had discussions with the Republican leader. We finished a conversation a short time ago. I indicated last Friday I would delay filing cloture on the motion to proceed to the immigration bill until today so that negotiations could continue. That cloture vote will occur now on Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican leader and I will continue our discussions about the best way to proceed with the supplemental. The bill is expected to be received from the House today and will be placed on the Senate calendar when it arrives. The Senate must complete action on the supplemental this week so it can be conferenced with the House and sent to the President prior to the scheduled Memorial Day recess. It will occur. That is, the conference will be completed or we will delay our recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Senate can expect to receive a conference vote on the budget sometime later this week. We need to act on that also. Under the Budget Act, debate time is limited to 10 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So a busy week lies ahead for us in the Senate. We have one week after this before the Memorial Day break.</paragraph>
