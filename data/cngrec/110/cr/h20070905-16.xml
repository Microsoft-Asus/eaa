  <narrative>GAO REPORT FINDS LITTLE PROGRESS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10081]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush continues to ignore reality in Iraq, instead glossing over the deteriorating situation while asking for more money from Congress and more personal sacrifice from our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A report released by the White House in July claimed that progress had been made on eight of the 18 benchmarks mandated by the Congress. But a new, unbiased report from the GAO shows that the situation is even worse than the White House led us to believe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the GAO report, Iraq has failed to meet all but three of the 18 benchmarks required for political and military progress in Iraq. Some of the report's most disconcerting findings include the fact that the capabilities of Iraqi security forces have not improved and that violence remains high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with the release of this discouraging and objective report, Republicans in this body must decide whether to continue rubber-stamping the President's failed policy in Iraq or begin working with Democrats to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
