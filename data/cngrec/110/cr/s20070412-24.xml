    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor former New England Patriots Quarterback Drew Bledsoe on his retirement, after 14 years in the National Football League, NFL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drew Bledsoe helped usher in the modern era of Patriots football. Throughout his career, Drew Bledsoe may have also played for the Buffalo Bills, an AFC East rival of the Patriots, and for the Dallas Cowboys, but he got his start in chilly Foxboro, MA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourteen years ago, a young Bledsoe was the first overall selection in the NFL Draft for New England draft of Washington State. He brought the Patriots to their first Super Bowl in 11 years, and despite ultimately losing to Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers, a newfound feeling of excitement and pride overtook New England's football fans. And that feeling hasn't subsided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After Tom Brady went down in the AFC playoff in 2002, Bledsoe led the Patriots to victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, ensuring the Pats a spot in Super Bowl XXXVI. And as you know, that was just the beginning of the New England football dynasty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bledsoe is a four-time Pro-Bowl quarterback, who throughout his career threw for more than 44,000 yards and completed more than 250 touchdown passes. He finished his career 7th all-time in yards passing, 13th in touchdowns, and 5th in completions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His career off the field was just as impressive. Bledsoe has long worked to help improve the lives of children by teaching parenting skills through both the Drew Bledsoe Foundation and Parenting with Dignity. The programs' curriculum, which teaches the importance of family values, is used nationwide, reaching an estimated 1.75 million American families. He has also served as international chairman of the Children's Miracle Network, helping to raise millions of dollars to benefit children nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bledsoe is the recipient of the Thurman Munson Humanitarian Award, the NFL Alumni Spirit Award for exemplifying the spirit of the NFL caring for kids and the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, chosen by his teammates for demonstrating balance between civic and professional responsibilities. He also received the Ed Block Courage award, chosen by his teammates as the NFL player demonstrating the most courage and character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drew Bledsoe has conducted himself with both dignity and maturity  throughout his 14 years in the NFL, and today I, along with Patriots fans across New England, congratulate him on a fantastic career and wish him success in the next chapter of his life.</paragraph>
