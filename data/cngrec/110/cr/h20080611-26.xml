    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, June 1 marked the beginning of yet another hurricane season, and experts have predicted a 90 percent probability of either a near-normal or an above-normal hurricane season. They estimate that six to nine hurricanes will form, including two to five major hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Approximately 50 percent of all Americans live along our coasts. As a result of that, millions, millions face great risk associated with these storms that we know are going to be out there. Having a hurricane preparedness plan can help lessen and mitigate some of those dangers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Hurricane Center recommends that people in hurricane-prone areas assemble a disaster supply kit that includes a first aid kit, essential medications, canned foods and at least 3 gallons of water per day per person for the minimum of 3 days. Obviously, extra battery-powered radios, extra batteries, and flashlights are also recommended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have learned in south Florida, the forecasters, meteorologists, and the hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center are often the best source of the most valuable and reliable information on preparedness. I urge all Americans to prepare for this hurricane season and to listen to what the forecasters have to say.</paragraph>
