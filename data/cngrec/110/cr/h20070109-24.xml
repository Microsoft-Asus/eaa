    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Gerald Ford, the Nation's 38th President, and the only person to serve both as President and Vice President, although elected to neither office, led the Nation out of the dark days of the Watergate scandal. When Ford took office on August 9, 1974, he declared: "I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After playing football at the University of Michigan and serving on an aircraft carrier in the Navy during World War II, Ford was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948 as a Republican. The district he represented included his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ford's reputation for integrity and openness made him popular and well regarded among his peers during his 25 years in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, he was elected minority leader. In October of 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned from office after pleading no contest to tax evasion. President Nixon, ensnared in the rising Watergate scandal, asked the well-respected Ford to leave Congress in order to replace Agnew, and he accepted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September 1974, Ford granted President Nixon a pardon, an act that is credited for calming American anxieties about the Watergate controversy. "It was a tough decision," Ford told USA Today in an interview in 2000. "We needed to get the matter off my desk so I could concentrate on the problems of 260 million Americans and not have to worry about the problems of one man."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford was a devoted public servant who led this country with grace and bipartisanship during challenging times. All of America is grateful to him for his leadership and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, though he served as President for only 2 1/2  years, Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr., leaves a legacy of leadership and service that will endure for years to come. As the 38th President of the United States, he is remembered as a man whose integrity and decency would be the salve needed to heal a deeply divided country during one of the most politically turbulent periods in our Nation's history. He is also remembered as a loving and loyal husband, family man, and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on July 14, 1913, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Gerald Ford graduated from the University of Michigan and excelled in both academics and athletics. He was voted the most valuable player on the football team his senior year at Michigan, which led to offers to play for the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these offers, Ford decided that law would be a better career choice. He attended Yale University Law School, graduating in the top 25 percent of his class while working as a football and a boxing coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was at Yale that he would receive his first taste of national politics, volunteering on Wendell Willkie's 1940 Presidential campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His rise in Michigan politics was put on hold when he joined the United States Navy in 1942 to serve in the Second World War. He served valiantly on the aircraft carrier USS Monterrey until 1946, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1948 was a banner year for Ford as it was the year he was elected to the House of Representatives, with over 60 percent of the vote, the lowest margin he was ever to receive. It was also the year he would marry Elizabeth "Betty" Bloomer, who would become one of his most ardent campaigners and mother to their four children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ford served in the House for distinction and honor for 25 years, where his contributions earned him a reputation as a Congressman's Congressman. Even though his highest aspiration was to be Speaker of the House, he never got the chance. He did, however, hold the highest Republican post in a Democratically controlled Congress by being elected the minority leader in 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He held that post until 1973 when he was appointed by President Nixon to replace Spiro Agnew as Vice President of the United States of America amid allegations of corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, Gerald Ford became the 38th President of the United States and has the distinction of being the only person to serve as but never be elected by the populace to either the Presidency or the Vice Presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President, he followed a steady, sensible course to cope with the Nation's economic problems. He is credited with halting double-digit inflation and lowering unemployment. He also worked to solidify President Nixon's accomplishments in China and ended U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his leadership, the United States signed the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, commonly known as the Helsinki agreement, which ratified post-World War II European borders and supported human rights, and is now regarded as having helped bring down the Soviet Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe most importantly, his wisdom, courage and integrity restored the faith of the American people in the executive branch of government. His time in office is remembered for restoring trust and openness to the Presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His courageous and difficult decision to pardon President Nixon may have cost him the election. However, it is now regarded as being in the best interest of the Nation, allowing it to move forward and recover from a tumultuous time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving the Presidency, Ford became an international ambassador of American goodwill, a noted scholar and lecturer, and a strong supporter of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. And together with his wife, Betty, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999 in recognition of their dedicated public service and outstanding humanitarian contributions to the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Also in 1999 Ford received the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award, for his role in guiding the United States through the turbulent times of Watergate, the resignation of President Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War, and for restoring integrity and public trust to the Presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald R. Ford, the President and the man, embodied many fine characteristics that we as Americans value: honor, integrity, decency, hard work and kindness. For this, I ask my colleagues to join in honoring his legacy by supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for his remarks and would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan, Representative Bart Stupak.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution, paying tribute to one of Michigan's greatest sons, a man who dedicated the best years of his life to public service, President Gerald R. Ford. Those who knew Gerald Ford remember him for his humility, his understanding of the virtue of public service and his dedication to his family. Michigan and America have lost a statesman who truly believed in the honor of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford will be remembered not only for his Presidency but also for his distinguished career representing Michigan in Congress and for his service as minority leader of the United States House of Representatives. He believed deeply in this institution, and he served his State, his party and his Nation skillfully as a Congressman for more than a quarter of a century. President Ford exemplified the values both of this institution and the great State of Michigan with humility, good humor,  faith and persistence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford did not seek power or fame, but he answered the call of our Nation's highest office when our Nation needed him. He was selected to be Vice President because of his high character, bipartisanship and integrity. Eight months later, these qualities were evident when President Ford helped heal a divided nation after the Watergate scandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no better demonstration of a tribute to President Gerald R. Ford than the outpouring of gratitude and respect from ordinary citizens when he was laid to rest on January 3. The people of Michigan remember him not only as President or minority leader but as a constant presence in our lives and as a selfless, dedicated public servant who talked about the values that unite us in the most divisive of times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Gerald R. Ford represented us with honor and courage, and he will be deeply missed. To Betty and his children, Michael, Jack, Steven and Susan, thank you for sharing the President with us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the author of this resolution, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="15">H. Res. 15</bill>, a resolution I introduced along with Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader Boehner, Majority Leader Hoyer and the entire Michigan congressional delegation. This resolution honors our great President, Gerald R. Ford, who was also an outstanding Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am privileged to serve in the same House seat that President Ford held. I am still deeply honored when people, both here and in Grand Rapids, Michigan, refer to my district as "Jerry Ford's district." After all these years, they still consider it to be Jerry's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He personified the many good traits that West Michigan has to offer our Nation; honesty, integrity and a sense of courage and duty. I think you are going to hear these words a great deal as we honor President Ford in this chamber, where he honorably served for 25 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was deeply touched by the funeral services and memorial celebrations held for President Ford over the past 2 weeks since his death on Tuesday, December 26, 2006. I want to thank all those who helped plan and carry out those memorable events, which solemnly reflected on this great man and his service and leadership to our Nation. I am pleased that this House can now take time at the beginning of a new Congress to celebrate and remember one of our own Members and the great things that he did  for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many younger Americans, these past tributes have served as a history lesson about the so-called "accidental President." They have learned, and those of us who knew him, have remembered his athletic prowess at the University of Michigan; his brave service in the Navy during World War II; his outstanding representation of Grand Rapids and Western Michigan in the Congress; his ascension to the Republican Leader's position in 1965; his appointment and confirmation as Vice President in 1973;  and, of course, his rise to the Presidency in the wake of Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has struck me during the memorial services and tributes is the shift in the way President Ford is regarded as compared to some of the opinions during his Presidency. For example, at the time of his appointment as Vice President, the Wall Street Journal editors wrote that the nomination "caters to all the worst instincts on Capitol Hill, clubbiness, partisanship and the small-mindedness that thinks in terms of those who should be rewarded rather than those who could best fill the job."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Little did the Wall Street Journal know that the Congress had in fact picked the person who could best fill the job; they later changed their thoughts and their writings about President Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think a lot of people probably thought at the time as the Wall Street Journal did. He was a political insider, from a relatively small city in Michigan, who many knew little about. But those of us in Grand Rapids, his constituents and his colleagues, knew who he was, a decent, thoughtful, trustworthy man, full of integrity and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it turns out, the country should be eternally grateful for the blessing of the timely leadership, strength and wisdom of Jerry Ford during this perilously difficult time in the constitutional history of our nation. I am glad that 30 years of history have shown that the Members of Congress, and those who advised President Nixon on his appointment, knew what they were talking about and what they were doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford's appointment and his ascendency to the office of President was not the result of "clubbiness" or "political favor." He was the person best suited to fill the job, and he literally healed our Nation by the actions that he took during those troubled times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the opinion writers at the Wall Street Journal recognized this when editorializing after his death. They eloquently wrote that President Ford navigated many perils in his short tenure, including the public furor over Watergate, the unpopularity of the Vietnam War, dramatic inflation and a struggling economy, and, as they put it, "better than he gets credit for."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that over time history will continue to hold President Ford in even higher regard for the actions he took to bring honor and respect back to the Presidency, to stabilize the  economy, and to lay the groundwork for freedom and democracy to spread and for Soviet communism to fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to Betty and to their children, Michael, Jack, Steven and Susan, as well as their grandchildren. The Ford family demonstrated remarkable composure and strength during these long weeks of mourning, and we thank them for helping to lead us in our grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of this new year and this new Congress, I am hopeful that we in this House will be mindful of the life and legacy of Jerry Ford. He served in this House with distinction, he treated everyone with respect, and he always conducted himself with honesty, integrity and forthrightness in every matter he undertook. I pray that we will do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His family creed, incidentally, although humorous, is one we should all emulate: "Work hard, tell the truth, and come to dinner on time."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know all my colleagues will support this resolution to honor our 38th President.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the last week we have heard many discussions about the impact of President Gerald Ford. We have heard people talk about the fact that he was never elected to either the Presidency nor the Vice Presidency of the United States. But yet his impact has been felt in such a way, as I listened to Representative Ehlers from Michigan talk, that people still refer to the district as his district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hear individuals who are sports fans who remember his days as an athlete when he played football and the fact that whatever the assignments were, that he could pick up the assignment and do exceptionally well with it, and that oftentimes he didn't veer too far from the center. He didn't always veer so far to the left or he didn't always veer so far to the right, but he was one of these kind of straight-down-the-middle people who protected the interests of his colleagues, who protected the well-being  of his mates, who protected the interests of those on the team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think he saw America as a team and, when he was given the ball, decided that his greatest challenge was to protect the interests of America. And that is what he did, even though he probably knew that it would cause some difficulty with his reelection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though he knew that in all likelihood and all probability there were individuals who would be concerned enough that they may not give him the kind of support that he would need to be reelected, he did it anyway. He did it because he could put the interests of the country above those of any personal feelings or personal need that he had. I think that that is really what puts him down in history as one who excelled to the point of greatness, because he served the country and served the interests  of the country extremely well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when students study politics, when young people are trying to understand what it is that they need to be and what they ought to become if they really want to be a great public servant, they should study the life of President Gerald Ford, and they should understand that being a public servant is to put the public interest first. That is what he did, that is what he is noted for, and that is why all of America continues to revere him, especially those of us who are old enough to remember  that period, who are old enough to kind of recall the mood of the people and what was taking place and what was going on at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter how historians write the script, you can never take away what President Gerald Ford did for America. That is why we salute him, and that is why we raise him up; that is why we lift him to the American people, and that is why this resolution is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud Michigander today to express my profound respect and appreciation and admiration for the life and public service of our 38th President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Gerald Ford was a man of impeccable integrity and ethics who served valiantly in World War II on the USS Monterey, where he came close to losing his life in December of 1944. After returning home to Michigan, his calling remained in public service to his country. He ran for the Grand Rapids area congressional seat against an incumbent Republican congressman. Nobody thought he could win. But with a strong conviction and a clear contrast between the two, he won two-to-one in  the primary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>President Ford went on to serve 25 years in the U.S. House and was voted in 1961 by the House membership as a "Congressman's Congressman." Rising to the rank of Republican leader, he was known for his modesty, his intelligence and thoughtfulness throughout his career. After Ford became President, his decisions that he made, though costing him politically, healed a fractured Nation. Today, we thank him for putting our country ahead of his own political success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May we never forget this great Michigander, and may the Lord's blessings be upon his family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to how much time I have left.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Illinois has 21 minutes remaining and the gentleman from Virginia has 18 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes when we talk about civil rights and the era of civil rights, and we talk of the individuals who were pushing perhaps the most, sometimes the name of Gerald Ford does not get included in that discussion, and he is not included in that discussion because he didn't always loom as high as some others might have. He was not necessarily one of these individuals that you would just simply know about. Oftentimes he did what he did somewhat quietly but, nevertheless, did it and it had the impact  that it was designed to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such were his positions relative to civil rights issues, even prior to ever seeking or getting involved in public office. I was told a story of how, as he captained the football team, that there were some controversies relative to an African American member of the team who was not going to get an opportunity to play. Of course, President Ford, as football team captain at that time, a sort of president-in-waiting, learning what leadership really meant and what leadership was all about, just sort  of took the position that if this gentleman was not going to be able to play, then neither would he. And of course the team was concerned, because if you have a star and the star is not playing, then of course it decreases your chance of winning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think of what America would be if all of us stood up all of the time for stars, or for the individuals who had the potential to be stars, to make sure that they got their rightful chance, their rightful opportunity, got their acceptance because of what they could contribute and because of what they brought to the table. I guess that really was the understanding that Gerald Ford had even at that moment, and all of America continues to be grateful to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time it would be my pleasure and my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from California, the Speaker of the House, such time as she might consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and applaud him, Mr. Davis of Illinois, and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis), for bringing this resolution to the floor to honor a great man, and I rise today to join them in paying tribute to the life and leadership of President Gerald Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to also recognize Mrs. Betty Ford and the wonderful children, Michael, Jack, Steven, and Susan, who with their love and support helped to make President Ford's leadership possible; but they made a contribution in their own right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Betty Ford really changed the way people in America talked about their health and the challenges in their lives. Every family in America respects her, every family in America is in her debt for, again, changing how people speak about their physical and other challenges. Mrs. Ford, we all give you our condolences and our respect and admiration for your leadership as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having also served as House minority leader, as President Ford did, I have  great respect for the fair and reliable leadership that President Ford displayed throughout his service in the House. He was effective and respected on both sides of the aisle. He recognized that however much we may disagree on political questions, we serve the people of the Nation, the great institution, the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He later became President, and another President, Thomas Jefferson, said: "Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle." Gerald Ford knew that. Gerald Ford followed that. He assumed office during one of the greatest times of challenge for our Nation and provided the American people with the steady leadership and optimism that was his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The outpouring of emotion and affection displayed by the American people last week and the week before reminds us that they desire the kind of leadership President Ford embodied. In this hour, we need and pray for President Ford's character, courage, and civility to affect us. He healed the country when it needed healing. This is another time, another war, and another trial of our American will, imagination, and spirit. I ask our colleagues, let us honor his memory not just in eulogy but in dialogue  and trust across the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, our condolences to the family. I hope it is a comfort to the Ford family that so many people mourn their loss and are praying for them at this time.</paragraph>
