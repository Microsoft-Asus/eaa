  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the work of the Snowsports Outreach Society, SOS Outreach, based in Vail, CO, which is dedicated to providing outdoor recreation and confidence-building opportunities to underprivileged youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The snow sports industry is an essential part of Colorado's lifestyle, economy, and image. Colorado's mountainous terrain and world-class resorts have set the standard for the ultimate experience in sliding on snow. As a skier, I understand the importance of this outdoor activity--in all its forms-- for its health benefits as well as the recreation economy of Colorado and the country's ski resorts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOS Outreach complements the benefits of snow sports by providing dynamic programs to 2,500 youth in need nationwide. During the current season, 2,000 Colorado participants will be enrolled in a 7-year curriculum. I am proud to recognize the work that they do to grow the sport and promote positive self-esteem in their participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now celebrating its 14th anniversary, SOS Outreach was founded in Vail, CO, in 1993. SOS Outreach is a grassroots, 501(c)(3) organization. Through the work of its founder and executive director, Arn Menconi, and former director of snowboarding for Vail Resorts, Ray Sforzo, a charity was developed that appealed to the mountain resort's desire to build the community by serving underprivileged youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOS Outreach first introduced youth to the benefits of outdoor recreation during the 1995/1996 season when they taught 40 youth snowboarding. They were provided with one day of free lessons, equipment, and lift tickets. Since their first season, SOS Outreach has partnered with mountain resorts, youth agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual donors to expand its nationally recognized curriculum and serve over 7,500 youth. SOS Outreach is further leveraging their partnerships to expand  their programs and include skiing. Over 7,000 program days will be provided at 29 resorts across the country, 13 in the State of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOS Outreach provides participants with a high-quality, resilience-based program that positively impacts a participant's self-esteem and ability to participate positively within their communities; supports underserved youth through adult mentorship; and encourages personal character education through SOS Outreach's five core values: courage, discipline, integrity, wisdom, and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOS Outreach would not be successful without the substantial support of the following individuals and organizations. I would like to recognize and thank each of them for sustaining such a program in Colorado:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Jensen and Kara Heide of Vail Resorts; Ken Gart and everyone at Specialty Sports Venture; Chris Ryman of Booth Creek Ski Holdings; Colorado Mountain Resorts for their donation of lift tickets, lessons, and rental equipment; Harry Frampton and Ceil Folz of the Vail Valley Foundation; Robert Veitch of the Harold W. Shaw and Mary Louise Shaw Foundation; Linda Childers of the Daniels Fund; William Hybl of the El Pomar Foundation; Bill Cotton of Optic Nerve Sunglasses; Robert Marcovitch of K2  Inc.; Mike West of 686; Wendy and Mike Carey of Seirus; Chaos Hats; Ride Snowboards; Salomon Sports; Sutherland Foundation; Bob Hernreich; Kay and Craig Tuber; to the staff of SOS Outreach: Arn and Anne Menconi, Michelle Hartel, Jon Garrou, Seth Ehrlich, Jody Link, Thersa Bisio; and the hundreds of adults that give of themselves to be positive mentors to these young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize SOS Outreach for its work and extend my wishes for its continued success.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I object to the unanimous consent agreement to pass <bill type="s" number="2338">S. 2338</bill>, the FHA modernization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has twice attempted to pass a complex and critical mortgage reform bill without the opportunity for debate or amendment. I certainly understand the importance of this issue, which is why I believe the bill must be afforded time for proper scrutiny and debate by the Senate. It is nai 4ve, irresponsible and reckless for the Senate to claim it can fix this national challenge by rubberstamping our approval for this legislation without the opportunity to improve the bill through amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly, however, this bill is not the proper response to the housing crisis. This bill increases the availability of government-backed mortgages, adding a liability to the taxpayer of $1.6 billion in government-backed loans. This bill greatly increases the loan limit which the government may insure, while simultaneously decreasing the down payment requirement for borrowers. This only makes taxpayers liable for billions of dollars in loans that may default. The solution to the mortgage  crisis is fewer risky loans, not more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proponents of the legislation have argued that this bill is a low-risk way for the government to prevent future subprime foreclosures. However, this bill only creates more opportunities for borrowers to receive government-backed loans, increasing the liability on American citizens, but not preventing the possibility of delinquency or default.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent analysis by the Wall Street Journal, many subprime borrowers are not delinquent because they cannot afford increasing adjustable rates, but because they cannot afford their initial rates in the first place. The Wall Street Journal states:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true that many subprime borrowers were sold a toxic mortgage by unscrupulous mortgage brokers. However, the primary reason for the spike in subprime delinquencies so far is that many subprime borrowers have taken on more debt than they can pay back using any reasonable interest rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be unconscionable to shift this burden on to the Federal Government, especially at a time when our national debt stands well over $9.1 trillion, or $30,132 per citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-one economists from universities and think-tanks from across America released an open letter to the U.S. Congress advising against "excessive new regulations or federal interventions" to deal with credit repricing in the subprime mortgage market. The letter warns: "Legislation to create new underwriting standards will reduce competition and restrict consumer access to credit. Additionally, efforts to bail out or shore up lending institutions create a moral hazard that would slow the  adjustments required in the marketplace. ..... These [bail out] proposals would fundamentally alter the workings of the mortgage market, leaving consumers with fewer choices when seeking to buy a home and potentially increasing taxpayer exposure for bad loans."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people agree that making government-backed loans more available is not the right response. According to a survey conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of the National Taxpayers Union, NTU, when asked which statement most closely reflects their views of allowing Federal agencies to increase the size of the loans they can insure and reduce downpayment requirements, 66 percent of respondents answered that "these proposals are nothing more than a taxpayer-funded bailout of banks  and lenders that provided and profited from these risky loans." Furthermore, 60 percent of respondents said taxpayers would be most negatively affected if the government were to bail out the subprime mortgage market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do believe the Senate should debate this issue, and examine what can be done to keep borrowers from defaulting and ensure that Americans are able to stay in their homes. I believe lenders must take responsibility for their loans, including full disclosure about the terms of the agreement and the possibility of default, and borrowers must be responsible for the agreement into which they enter. Mortgage brokers, real estate agents and other lenders should be transparent with their lending conditions  and must be accountable for full disclosure to borrowers. However, I do not believe it is the job of the government to bail out default mortgages and loans and it is not the proper role of the government to insure loans with taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
