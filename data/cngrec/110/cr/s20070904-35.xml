  <narrative>SWEARING IN OF MAURICE DUB&#xC9; -- (Senate - September 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11046">S11046</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Maurice "Moe" Dub&#xE9; whom I had the privilege to on August 14 welcome home to Maine and officially swear in as Maine's district director of the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA. I was incredibly honored to be able to celebrate Moe's appointment with him and his family in Lewiston-Auburn, where both of our roots run so deep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moe's return to Maine is wonderful news for the numerous small businesses and manufacturers in our state who depend on the SBA and the valuable programs it administers. In my capacity as the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have had the  privilege of working with Moe during his previous service with the SBA and know that his experience, expertise, and dedication will be a true asset for Maine's robust small  business community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because our State so depends on small businesses and entrepreneurship for our economic livelihood, I have long believed that the district director position is one of Maine's most critical appointments. Indeed, according to the SBA, in 2005, Maine had an estimated 151,000 small businesses of which over 111,000 were led by self-employed entrepreneurs. Of the 40,000 Maine firms with employees, an overwhelming 97.5 percent were small businesses employing fewer than 500 employees. Clearly, Maine small  businesses are the job creators and drivers of our economy, so it is critical to have a district director who will help our state make the most of the SBA's vital programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his new capacity as district director, Moe will, among other things, be responsible for the administration of the SBA business loan portfolio; the oversight of the Maine Small Business Development Center Network; the coordination of Maine's SCORE chapters; and oversight of the Women's Business Center at Coastal Enterprises, Inc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Moe will clearly have a lot on his plate as he takes the reins as district director, I am confident that his long experience at the SBA, which he joined in 1987, makes him eminently qualified. Moe began his SBA career as a liquidation loan officer in the SBA's Maine district office before moving to the business development division, where he was promoted to assistant district director for business development and later to deputy district director. His most recent assignment prior to  relocating to Maine was as district director of the SBA's Massachusett district office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Moe was with the Maine SBA, I and my staff had the pleasure of working hand-in-glove with him on a variety of issues on behalf of our State's small businesses. I can tell you firsthand that his comprehensive background, keen acumen, and tireless dedication will be outstanding assets for Maine's small business community. And perhaps most importantly, in an ideal "one-two punch" for our small businesses, Moe not only knows how to deliver SBA programs as effectively as possible--but Moe also  knows Maine. I look forward to continuing to collaborate with Moe as he advances the SBA's agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Moe will make a fine district director, and I am so pleased that a man of his talents has accepted this position, which is so vital to Maine's economy. I look forward to working with him closely to ensure that Maine small businesses will continue to thrive and create opportunities for all Mainers.</paragraph>
