    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say to our President that the people have spoken and they have spoken quite loudly. Just the other night I ran into the family of Sergeant Kendall Waters-Bey, who was one of the first military folks who died in the war. He is from my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His family just said one thing. "Ask the President what his plan is, his true plan for getting us out of there. Ask why is he being so stubborn. Ask how many have to die, like our relative died, and we still don't fully understand why."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President presented us with some statements last night, but we have heard them before. The American people have been patient, and they have simply run out of patience. So we must continue to loudly speak into the President's ear that the people do not want this war. They want to get our folks out of Iraq. Three thousand have already been killed, and others are being harmed every day.</paragraph>
