  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SENATORS -- (Senate - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10859">S10859</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="CHUCK HAGEL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise tonight to recognize and pay tribute to my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Chuck Hagel, who is retiring from the Senate. When I entered this body nearly 8 years ago, Senator Hagel welcomed me, and since then we have worked together on a number of important issues for the good of our great State and our country. We teamed up to seek Federal assistance to help Nebraskans recover from natural disasters, such as floods, ice storms,  and drought; to win congressional approval for naming the new FBI building in Omaha after our esteemed late colleague, Senator J. James Exon, and on numerous other Nebraska projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like me, Chuck Hagel grew up in small communities in Nebraska. It is a special experience to be raised among Nebraskans under the wide open skies of the Great Plains. Helping hands are always nearby and opportunities seem limitless. From our families, friends, and neighbors, we both learned the bedrock values of love, of community, of faith, responsibility to others, and devotion to country. These values have been evident during Senator Hagel's tenure in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also evident has been an important perspective he shared, one only a few Senators know firsthand, about the reality of war, gained as a decorated U.S. Army sergeant on violent battlefields in the Vietnam war and later as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Veterans' Administration during the Reagan administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in the Senate, he represented the people of Nebraska and the United States well as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Banking Committee, the Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Rules Committee. He will long be remembered as one of our most outspoken and candid Members, as a patriot, and as one who took seriously his duties. Particularly through expressing his views on foreign policy, he fiercely advocated the constitutional principle that  the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government are equal partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take this opportunity to commend him for his honorable service to our State and Nation over these many years. And whatever path Chuck Hagel embarks on next, I wish him and his wife Lilibet, daughter Allyn, and son Ziller only the best in their lives. It has been an honor to serve with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHUCK HAGEL">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Are we in a period of morning business or has it been closed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Yes, The Senate is in morning business.</chair>
