    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me for a moment as I reflect on the many accomplishments of Barbara Kerr, who has just stepped down as president of the California Teachers Association. Barbara's dedication to California's teachers is matched only by her dedication to California's schoolchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Kerr began her career in education as a first grade teacher at Woodcrest Elementary School in Riverside, CA. After a very long involvement with the California Teachers Association, she took the reins as its president 4 years ago. During her presidency, Barbara has had an intimate hand in six statewide elections, and she has been on the winning side in most of them. Her success can be attributed to her boundless energy, her ability to connect across the political spectrum, her keen insight,  and her passion for giving every child the best possible educational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Los Angeles Times named Barbara Kerr the third most powerful person in southern California, ranking her well ahead of both business leaders and elected officials. And the Los Angeles Times was right. Barbara has led the California Teachers Association through some of the most turbulent times in California's history and has done so with a clear aim to put California schools and their teachers and students first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara is retiring from both the California Teachers Association and from teaching. I know that teachers across California will miss her strong leadership, and I will miss her perspective and wisdom on issues of education and more. But Barbara is also considering where the future may lead, and I can only hope that she will continue to stay involved and stay active. Where ever the future leads her, I know that Barbara will continue putting the needs of our children first.</paragraph>
