    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Louis Fernandez as he retires from a long career in public service as provost and vice president for academic affairs with California State University, San Bernardino. His service and commitment to the students, faculty, and staff of California State University, San Bernardino, and to his community have provided an example for us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After earning his doctorate in geology from Syracuse University, Dr. Fernandez served at several institutions of higher learning throughout the Nation. At each of these universities, Dr. Fernandez was as an exemplary educator and community leader. Through his career at the University of New Orleans as a professor, dean and department chair, Dr. Fernandez worked to secure the university's first National Science Foundation grant to recruit and mentor underrepresented students in the geosciences.  The State of Louisiana named him Educational Administrator of the Year in 1991, and he has since received numerous laudatory titles and honors for his work in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Fernandez later joined the California State University, San  Bernardino campus. By 1994 he served as acting vice president for academic affairs, and was named provost a year later. Since then, Dr. Fernandez has served the university and the surrounding communities by working to secure a sound academic plan for academic growth, a responsible university budget, and a university-wide commitment to student diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For several years, Dr. Fernandez chaired the National Association of Geology Teachers Minority Affairs Committee. He served on the National Science Foundation's Advisory Committee to the Earth Sciences. He chaired the American Geological Institute's Minority Participation Program Advisory Committee, and as a member of the Geological Society of America's Ad Hoc Committee on Minorities, and the National Association of Geology Teacher's Minority Scholarship Program. For his broad service and leadership,  the Hispanic Caucus of the American Association of Higher Education awarded him the Outstanding Support of Hispanic Issues in Higher Education Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his long career in education and public service, Dr. Louis Fernandez has consistently worked to foster stronger communities and attain higher education ideals. I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on his retirement.</paragraph>
