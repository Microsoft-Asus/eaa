    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my concern that the Democrats will not extend tax measures critical to the American people. Residents in my own State are at risk. Floridians currently can deduct their sales tax from the Federal income tax. However, this deduction expires this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Democrats set their agenda for the coming year, there is talk of offsetting increases in Federal spending by raising taxes for millions of Americans. Quite frankly, I worry that the use of this provision will be to pay for additional spending. Constituents don't want additional taxes. They want us to be more conservative in spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen up, America. Congress needs to be sure that taxpayers do not face unnecessary tax increases. I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our constituents are able to keep more of their hard-earned money.</paragraph>
