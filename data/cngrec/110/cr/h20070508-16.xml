  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many Americans lack protection from catastrophic long-term care expenses related to chronic illnesses and disabilities. Worse yet, many of these families assume Medicare will pay for long-term care services, while it generally does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite funding from Congress for long-term care education activities, the Department of Health and Human Services has done little to inform families and caregivers of this confusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HHS has neglected to clarify these Medicare misperceptions with at least 90 percent of households contacted through its long-term care awareness direct mail campaign. HHS has a duty to use other communication methods to inform families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently introduced a bipartisan resolution with Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin to encourage Secretary Leavitt to be more proactive on this issue, so Americans can have greater independence, choice and control over the services they need in the setting they prefer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hc" number="133">H. Con. Res. 133</bill>.</paragraph>
