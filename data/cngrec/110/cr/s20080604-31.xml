    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Onida, SD. As the county seat of Sully County, this vibrant, progressive community has been a center of commercial and civic activity since its inception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The site which Onida is built on was chosen by Charles Agar, Charles Holmes, and Frank Brigham of Oneida NY. Within a month of raising the single place of lodging in Onida for land-seekers, the city gained a grocer, hardware store, and post office. When declared the seat of Sully County, a courthouse, permanent hotel, multiple grocers, and a bank were soon to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Onida is a prime example of the natural beauty and recreation in South Dakota that follows the Louis and Clark Trail up the Missouri River. Its business sector encompasses a wide variety of trades from agriculture, automotive, finance, and tourist amenities. Hunting and fishing are significant draws of the area, and support many local resorts based on such recreational activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Onida will be celebrating its quasquicentennial during the Oahe Days in early August. Even 125 years after its founding, Onida continues to be a vital community and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to publicly honor Onida on this memorable occasion. The citizens of Onida are continuing to live up to their motto: miles and miles of sunflower smiles.</paragraph>
