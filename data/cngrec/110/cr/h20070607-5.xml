  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Congress is at a low point in terms of its ratings with the American public, but I want the American public to know that I am proud to be a Member of this Congress. Congress is part of a system of government that involves the executive and a two-part legislature that includes the Senate and the House. Our system of government is the best ever known to man, and it's working; although slowly, it's working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The country has told the Congress and the President what the American people want, and that is to bring our troops home from Iraq, or to redeploy them to fight al Qaeda in Afghanistan and other places where there is terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have increased the minimum wage. We have put more money into Pell Grants. We have reduced the cost of college loans. We are going to try to pass a bill, which I think we will today, on stem cell research to give people with catastrophic illnesses hope for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress is doing things to make America better. We are doing it in a responsible way with a balanced budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a Member of this Congress, and I want this country to know that this Congress is working hard and doing its job to put America on the right course. We are draining the swamp to make this a more ethical place.</paragraph>
