  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="TRIBUTE TO COBB ENERGY PERFORMING ARTS CENTRE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the Record the grand opening of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre is the first major performing arts facility built in metro Atlanta in four decades and upon opening will immediately become the new home of the Atlanta Opera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great deal of planning has gone into the development of this state-of-the-art landmark on Atlanta's horizon by great friends and community leaders such as Earl Smith, Travis Duke, Johnny Gresham, Max Bacon, Bill Dunaway, Sam Olens, Robert Voyles, and Michele Swann. Special gratitude also goes to John Williams, a great benefactor and the namesake of this grand 2,750-seat theatre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The arts are an essential ingredient for the quality of life of a community and the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre will improve the quality of life not just for the community of Cobb but for the entire metropolitan Atlanta region and the Southeastern United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the Senate the grand opening of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre. I congratulate the community on this wonderful new crown jewel.</paragraph>
