    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of John Rock, who passed away in November of 2007. John was an invaluable member of the Black Hills community, and he will be truly missed by all who knew him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John will be remembered for his dedication to service in the Black Hills region. He made many invaluable contributions to the region through his extensive knowledge and life experiences. This dedication was evident through John's support of the Mammoth Site museum in Hot Springs, SD. He worked with the finance/personnel and governance committees and the board of directors of the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs, SD, Inc., from 2001 to 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his being recognized by the Mammoth Site board, two theater seats will be dedicated to John and his wife Bonnie. A plaque in John's honor will also be placed on the Memorial Wall at the Mammoth Site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Rock's absence will be deeply felt in the Black Hills community. He was a truly dedicated individual who will be remembered for his lifetime of service to others.</paragraph>
