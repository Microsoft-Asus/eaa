    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time to get off the fast track of lost jobs and on the right track for our American workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these very Chambers I hear that we just need to fix labor provisions and trade agreements and do a side deal on fast track and then the problem is solved. This is simply not good enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my fellow Democrats that this is a time to sound the alarm on fast track. Fast track hamstrings Congress' ability to fix our broken trade policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The midterm elections show that most Americans understand that our current trade policies have failed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 3 million American manufacturing jobs, one out of every six manufacturing jobs, have been lost during the fast track era. The U.S. trade deficit has exploded as imports have surged. U.S. wages stagnate as trade deficits soar, displacing good U.S. jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fast track trashes the checks and balances that are essential for our democracy. It is time to get Congress on the right track in the new majority. It is time for a new direction as we deal with trade agreements.</paragraph>
