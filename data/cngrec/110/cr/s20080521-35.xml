  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the Record of the Senate Laurel Zaks, an incredibly dedicated and universally beloved and respected civil servant who died on Friday, March 28, 2008. Laurel was a public health adviser at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, with more than 14 years international and domestic work experience as a nutritionist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurel started her career in 1992 as a nutritionist in Bucharest, Romania, with the Free Romania Foundation cross-training staff in three orphanages with medical clinics in health and nutrition issues. She then took a position as a community developer in Pop Wuj, Quetzeltenango, Guatemala, teaching primary health prevention strategies. She returned to the United States in 1996 where she developed and communicated policy and legislative strategy on domestic hunger for Congress and lobbied Congress  on nutrition programs involving welfare reform. While in Washington, she also served as a pediatric dietitian with the Children's National Medical Center working on initial and followup nutritional assessments of HIV/AIDS and gastrointestinal disease patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1997, Laurel joined the Peace Corps volunteering in Ecuador, where she used her training as a dietitian to work with the Ministry of Health and indigenous organizations to develop training materials promoting maternal and child health and prevention of infectious diseases. Next Laurel moved to the city, Santa Domingo de Los Colorados, to work at the Center for Malnourished Children and in local communities where she served as the nutritionist/health educator working in an interdisciplinary  medical team. During the last 2 1/2  years of her Peace Corps service, she was instrumental in helping to design a new $400,000 Children's Center for Nutrition Recuperation, which served an average of 40 families daily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurel joined CDC in 2001, 1 week after finishing her Peace Corps tour in Ecuador. Her enthusiasm for making a difference in global health affected all who knew her. She worked in many areas of global health work at CDC, including planning for development of sustainable global public health management, planning for a global pandemic influenza outbreak, and serving as a team member traveling to Botswana in response to an outbreak of infant diarrhea and severe malnutrition. In 2007, she was part  of a team honored for rapidly assisting 20 countries around the world to apply for pandemic influenza preparedness funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurel was an active member and leader in the Atlanta chapter of the Returned Peace Corps Volunteers. She gave countless hours to charitable organizations domestically and abroad, including the Manna Food Bank in North Carolina and as a charter member of the Ecuadorian Rivers Institute in Ecuador. She received various awards for her volunteer work and was bestowed the North Carolina Governor's Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as she did with the Peace Corps, Laurel's work over 7 years at CDC left a legacy of healthier people around the world. She inspired her coworkers to make a difference in global health, and all who knew her were struck by her compassion and the lasting contributions she made to children living in poverty around the world.</paragraph>
