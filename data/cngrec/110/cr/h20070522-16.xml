  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to opportunities of job growth and hopefully eradicating poverty through a green economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A major national investment in renewable energy could create potentially 3.5 million green-collar jobs over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must say to America's workers, particularly those in urban and rural underserved communities, there is a place for you in the green economy. Investment should not only be improving infrastructure, but improving economic opportunities for all. That is why I am proud to be working with Congressman JOHN TIERNEY and others to create a green jobs bill that will create pathways out of poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Job training can lead to self-sufficiency and prosperity through higher wages, access to benefits and more career choices. Other cities and States throughout the country have taken the lead to shape the new economy, which is creating demand for green products and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, Congress has taken steps to ensure our Nation has a secure energy future. I hope that ensuring underserved communities achieve economic security can be a part of this green future.</paragraph>
