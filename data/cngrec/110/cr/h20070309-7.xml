    <paragraph>There has been a lot of news on Iraq and the differing strategy between Congress and the President. Let's be clear about where the differences lie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration wants more time after 4 long years in Iraq; Democrats say it's time for a conclusion to the open-ended commitment. The administration wants 25,000 more troops for Iraq; Democrats are calling for the troops to be fully trained and equipped. The administration wants more money; Democrats are demanding Iraqis be held accountable for Iraq's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration policy has us policing a civil war; Democrats want to focus on al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The administration has failed our veterans on the health care they earned; Democrats are for making sure that the veterans get the health care they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Yogi Berra once said, "When you come to a fork in the road, take it." Madam Speaker, the President wants and is asking for more of the same; Democrats are calling for a new direction.</paragraph>
