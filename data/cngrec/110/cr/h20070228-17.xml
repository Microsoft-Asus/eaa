  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America has a drug problem, and I am not referring to the war on drugs on our streets. I am referring to the booming illegal opium trade in Afghanistan. This is our problem, Mr. Speaker, because the huge profits from growing opium in Afghanistan are being used against our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though illegal, opium production has skyrocketed in Afghanistan in recent years, and the results are deadly. Enormous profits often end up in the hands of the Taliban and local warlords who use it to buy weapons, pay fighters and bribe officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must adjust our policies if we are to see sustained stability in Afghanistan. Eradicating opium must become a priority. We must crack down on the drug lords, train local law enforcement, and help build the Afghan economy to provide opportunities for making an honest living. And we must ask our friends in Afghanistan's government to help us in this effort. The safety of our troops depends on it.</paragraph>
