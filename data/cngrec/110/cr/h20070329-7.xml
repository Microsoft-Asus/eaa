    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last weekend, I participated in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Walk to Cure Diabetes in my hometown of Boca Raton, Florida. I participated in this walk to help bring attention to the urgent need for finding a cure for juvenile diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also walked in honor of two children in my district, Sydney Lubetkin and Nicky Pollack. Nicky was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes as an infant, and Sydney was diagnosed with the illness just this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juvenile diabetes is a serious disease that inflicts tens of thousands of children across the United States. Not only does this illness cost us $100 billion in health care costs alone, but living with juvenile diabetes requires 24-7 care. Children must constantly take insulin shots and have their blood checked numerous times a day, and their diet and exercise regimen must always be under strict surveillance. In severe cases, juvenile diabetes can cause blindness, heart failure, stroke and, worst  case, death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I signed on as a sponsor of House Resolution 4 that urges Congress to appropriate $1.6 billion annually. I thank Members for their support.</paragraph>
