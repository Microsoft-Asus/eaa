    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I am pleased to yield the customary 30 minutes to my colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings from Washington.

  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1174 provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule makes in order seven amendments listed in the Rules Committee report, each of which is debatable for 10 minutes. The rule also provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008 and this rule. This New Direction Congress, led by Democrats, understands the impact of this unfortunate Bush economy on neighborhoods throughout America. In order for our country to recover from this economic downturn, it is critical that we stabilize housing for our neighbors and rebuild communities with more affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urged Congress to take  action earlier this week. He stated in part, summarized in this news report, "The reasons behind surging late payments and foreclosures can vary, and that needs to be taken into account when developing solutions. For instance, in parts of New England, States in the Great Lakes, including Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin, show increased mortgage delinquencies and notable increases  in unemployment rates. California, Florida, and parts of Colorado, on the other hand, saw delinquencies rise during a period when unemployment generally decreased but the value of homes declined."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "A widespread decline in home prices, by contrast, is a relatively novel phenomenon, and lenders and servicers will have to develop new and flexible strategies to deal with this issue. Rising foreclosures add to the glut of unsold homes, and that put more downward pressure on prices, aggravating the housing slump. More rapid declines in house prices could have an adverse impact on the broader economy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>See, this affects us all, and it affects the stability of the financial system overall. So it is vitally important that we bring this package today, this first bill, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and more to come because of the record number of foreclosures facing our neighbors back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under President Bush's economic policies, the number of families entering into foreclosure has increased from over 700,000 to 1.5 million last year, but today, we're going to bring new hope to our communities through revitalized neighborhoods and targeted affordable housing to families that need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008 provides our local communities with the tools they need to purchase and rehabilitate vacant and foreclosed homes. Now we all know a vacant, deteriorated, foreclosed home in our neighborhood has a devastating impact. We've all seen them. We've driven by them. They're overgrown. They are not paying the taxes like everyone else in the neighborhood is paying. They're causing a drain on services and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our initiatives today will help these nonprofit agencies and our local governments purchase those properties, turn them around, rehabilitate them and make them available to families that need them most, and in order to see that families with the greatest needs receive housing first, these new loans and affordable homes will be targeted especially to middle class families and those hardworking families back in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know this will help families in my home State of Florida which has been among the Nation's hardest hit States, particularly in my community in the Tampa Bay area. In fact, it was not long ago that one of my neighbors called to tell me that he recently lost his home to foreclosure, and he was dealing with the repercussions from that loss, trying to find another affordable place to live for him and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was pleased to know, however, that this Congress had already acted on a mortgage forgiveness debt relief act signed into law last year, and because of that act, he will not suffer a double whammy and get hit with an unaffordable tax bill to accompany the loss of his home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will help families from my community and communities across this Nation to rebuild and create more affordable housing. I am proud that this Congress has been so proactive and taken so many steps to combat the housing crisis. Millions of Americans will be helped because of the proactive leadership of Chairman BARNEY FRANK on the Financial Services Committee and Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to witness firsthand that this new Democratic Congress has made the lives of folks in my neighborhood and my community a whole lot better. Today, we will continue to move forward by passing the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and follow on that with the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act. These efforts reflect the continued work of this New Direction Congress and offer the most comprehensive response yet to the American mortgage crisis. We are providing much-needed  help to hardworking families in this unfortunate Bush economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Florida (Ms. Castor) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an oppressive rule, written to restrict debate in the House and to strip away rights from the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule makes in order four Democrat amendments and only three Republican amendments. This means that 80 percent of requested Democrat amendments were made in order, but just 33 percent, or one-third, of Republican amendments filed with the Rules Committee were made in order. Mr. Speaker, this isn't balanced. It's restrictive and not in the tradition of having an open debate on important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night at the Rules Committee, Financial Services Committee Chairman Frank said that he supported allowing debate on an amendment relating to illegal immigration and legitimate concerns of ensuring that persons illegally present in this country do not benefit from the new Federal program created by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rules Committee Democrats responded by making in order the least substantive, most meaningless and unenforceable immigration amendment possible. A Republican amendment by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite. of Florida had very clearly and explicitly made certain that anyone illegally present in this country cannot rent or buy a house from this new government program. That amendment was not made in order. Every Democrat on the Rules Committee voted to deny the House voting on this meaningful  amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when Democrat leaders aren't totally shutting down debate, they are giving the House window dressing instead of substance on important issues. Not content with blocking two-thirds of Republican amendments and restricting the opportunity of every Member of this institution to come to the House floor and offer amendments to improve, fix or alter this bill, House Democrat leaders went even further to shut down the minority, squelch dissent and take away their parliamentary rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 2 of this rule takes away the right of any Member of this House to make a motion that the House rise out of the Committee of the Whole and places it solely in the hands of the Democrat majority leader or the Democrat chairman of the Financial Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the new majority promised to run the most open, honest House in history. Instead of keeping their promises to the American people, Democrat leaders are acting with impunity as they shed any semblance of openness, fairness or regular order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't believe many of the freshmen Democrat Members who were elected in the last election came to Congress to block debate and prohibit Members from offering amendments on the House floor. Yet, Mr. Speaker, they have joined lock-step with Speaker Pelosi in stooping to a level of oppressive partisanship that far exceeds the sins of any previous Congresses. It's a shameful record that shatters the promise Democrat leaders made to the American people to run an open, honest House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all this is being done to pass a bill that would create a brand new, Big Government, $15 billion Federal program to buy, remodel, resell or rent thousands and thousands of houses across the country. Who will profit from this new $15 billion government program are the lenders who made the bad loans and then foreclosed on families who didn't make their mortgage payments. It's a bailout for home lenders that knowingly took risks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's terribly unwise and wasteful of taxpayer dollars to create a new government program that invites other lenders to take gambles on home loans because the American taxpayer will come along and wipe away their bad decisions. Mr. Speaker, why should American taxpayers be footing the bill for calculated mistakes made by others? Why should American taxpayers,  who are making their mortgage payments each month or who are paying rent, have to come along  and fund billions of dollars to give away grants and zero interest loans for those who speculated, gambled and lost? Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should not take this hit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I recognize that this bill is titled the Neighborhood Stabilization Act and that its stated intent is to help rehabilitate neighborhoods in metropolitan cities and urban communities that have multiple foreclosed homes sitting vacant and empty. But, Mr. Speaker, why should rural and middle America be forced to have their tax dollars used to bail out lenders in big cities and urban areas? I believe, Mr. Speaker, we should work to find incentives for people to purchase these homes and improve  these neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But we should oppose a new $15 billion spending program so the Federal Government can be involved in flipping houses or renting out homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this oppressive rule and the bad underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in support of this very, very important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this House of Representatives will vote on the most comprehensive response yet, bringing badly needed help to this Nation's troubling mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These House measures we will debate today will help in several areas: Number one, it will help families facing foreclosures to keep their homes; two, it will help families avoid foreclosures in the future; and three, it will help the recovery of communities in cities and towns across this Nation who are harmed by empty houses that are caught in the foreclosure process. And that's why I rise to support this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is our first bill out of the gate on this important measure. And it is extraordinarily important, Mr. Speaker, and that's why I support this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look across the landscape of America today, in neighborhood after neighborhood, homes empty, buildings empty, vandalism on high, violent crime on high, neighboring homes' property values going down, and right today, mortgages that are higher than the actual value of the property. And my good friends on the other side of the aisle question, why are we moving? Why is this a bailout? This is not a bailout. If anything, my dear friends, this is a bail-in. This is a bail-in to save communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the same arguments that I heard on this side were heard during when we had other disasters. This is a disaster, just as we had Katrina, just as we had tornados, just as we had unforeseen circumstances. I even heard some say, when Katrina was coming, well, they knew the hurricane was coming, why didn't they get out of the way? This country needs help, and they're looking for their government to do what government is supposed to do, help their country in a moment of greatest need. And there  is no greater need today than to help in this mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And foremost for that help is to get into these communities, give our State and local governments, whose fire departments, whose police departments, already strained, are overstrained, and to help those neighboring homes who are going down in value because these properties are standing there idle and empty and are nothing but havens for crime. That's why, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Ms. Waters and Chairman Frank for putting together the leadership of this bill, which I'm proud to be a cosponsor of, because it goes to the heart of the matter, and that is, saving America's communities. Fifteen billion dollars spread in two fashions, 7.5 for loans, 7.5 for grants. It's an excellent idea whose time has come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that each side get an additional 2 minutes so I can engage the gentleman and so he can have the time to yield to me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object. I do not yield for that purpose.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman does not yield for that request.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlelady from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito), a member of the Financial Services Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for recognizing me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am on the Financial Services Committee. And we have debated and had many hearings on what we all share is an issue before us with great urgency. We are facing serious challenges here in the housing market, and I think our committee has done great work on a bipartisan basis to pass numerous measures and to listen to the concerns all across the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think the greatest concern for me and for all of us here should be that individual in that home who stays up late at night or can't sleep at night because they can't figure out how they're going to stay in their house and afford to keep their home, keep their family safe in their home, and meet the challenges of either an adjustable rate or a house that maybe has devalued so much that they feel like their only option may be to walk away from their mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have two bills before us today. Later on, we're going to be considering <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, which is the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. This doesn't help that individual who can't sleep at night who we're most concerned about. The aim is to help big cities and other urban areas that have foreclosed properties, to revitalize that. That's an issue for another day. In my view, the issue we need to debate today is how we're going to help that individual who can't meet the challenges and wants  to stay in their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so on the larger bill that we're going to be considering later, unfortunately the bipartisan tone of our committee sort of broke down in the process. We had, I think, very spirited debates in front of our committee where our philosophies were shared and we actually found a lot of common ground, which is the way it should be. Because when an originator came forward with a bad loan or didn't ask for financials or didn't ask for background information on a potential buyer, they didn't ask, are  you a Republican or a Democrat? This isn't a partisan issue. That's why I think we should have a full and open debate here, and that's why I advocated for an open rule in front of the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the solutions that we're offering today are going to be diluted because we're not going to be able to hear the debate on the floor because the Rules Committee has decided, in their infinite wisdom--and I'm a former member of a Rules Committee, so I can say that--that the majority is using a seldom used rule that will really prevent our side from offering even a motion to recommit, where we can at least have our voice heard on this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm very disappointed that at this day in time, when we have that person at night staying up, that family wondering how they're going to stay in their home that night, they are not going to be able to see the choices that are before us as a body where we can say, we think this is more helpful, or we think this direction is the way we should go. For that I'm tremendously disappointed, especially in light of the committee that I serve on, Financial Services, where we did have this debate and  we had ideas that came forward and more ideas that could come forward on this House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I oppose this rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we're going to do everything we can in our power to help American families across this Nation that, yes, are facing foreclosure. In this package we bring today we will help the folks who are facing those adjustable rates and keep them out of foreclosure. But I don't think we should turn a blind eye to the significant increase in foreclosures, the rate of foreclosures that has happened since 2003 under the Bush Administration. In 2003, 734,000 foreclosures; 2004, 835,000  foreclosures. More in 2005 and 2006. 2007, a record-breaking 1.5 million foreclosed homes in America. This Neighborhood Stabilization Act will address those vacant foreclosed homes in our neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to call upon my colleague from the Rules Committee, Ms. Matsui from California, to further address the  issue. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing crisis has had an unprecedented effect on our economy. Our families, our neighborhoods, our communities are facing daily challenges, seeing increased foreclosures and vacancies everywhere they turn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own hometown of Sacramento is among the hardest hit in this country. Just last quarter, nearly 5,300 homes were foreclosed on. And sadly, there is no end in sight. My district is fifth in the Nation in adjustable rate mortgages, many of which are reset to higher rates in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make matters worse, Forbes magazine ranks Sacramento among the highest in homeowner debt. Twenty-eight percent of homeowners in my district hold second mortgages and/or home equity lines of credit, making it much more difficult for them to save their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This crisis is affecting everyone; homeowners who are in danger of foreclosure, renters who are being forced to move, and even families who are secure in their mortgages are seeing their home values fall, and increased neighborhood blight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this year I have met with many Sacramento families that are struggling with their mortgages in today's volatile economy. I have seen the sadness in their eyes and the emotional toll this crisis has taken on them. It is truly devastating. I met Susan at a foreclosure workshop. She had a traditional mortgage that was in good standing. Then, after repeated calls, she was steered by a lender to refinance her traditional loan into an adjustable rate loan so she could do home improvements.  Now the loan is scheduled to reset soon, and she will have a difficult time making ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another constituent, Jeanie, e-mailed me just last week. She has been forced to move twice already this year because the homes she was renting were foreclosed on. Without some stability in the housing market, Jeanie and her family, including their young daughter, will be forced to move again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to help these honest, hardworking homeowners immediately. This legislation is a step in the right direction. I urge support of this rule and this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule that brings this bill to the floor and to this $15 billion bailout bill, and I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think up here we lose sight of how much $15 billion really is. Fifteen billion dollars would operate the entire State government of Tennessee for almost 1 year, our education, our medical care, our prisons, our roads, our parks. And Tennessee is almost dead on average, statistics-wise, in regard to all the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 95 percent of the people are paying their mortgages on time. Consistent with that, about 95 percent of the people who have contacted my office or spoken to me about this bill, they don't want us to bail out people who have taken out loans that they couldn't afford. But even worse than that, the $15 billion that's in this bill, even worse, we're going to pass later today a $300 billion housing bill that we really can't afford. Tomorrow we're probably going to pass a $250 billion supplemental  appropriations bill. That's $565 billion in 2 days. And all three of these bills are outside the regular or don't even count the regular appropriations bills that we'll be taking up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, we're going to pass an almost $300 billion farm bill. A couple of weeks ago it came out that the Pentagon has had $295 billion in cost overruns on just their 72 largest weapons systems, not counting the cost overruns that would be in all the thousands of other large and medium size and small contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we rejected an effort by the administration to save $50 billion over the next 10 years on the Medicaid rules even though payments to hospitals under the Medicaid program have gone up two to three times the rate of inflation every year for the last 15 or 20 years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>David Walker, who just retired as the head of the GAO, respected by both sides, said that even worse than the $9 trillion national debt that we have is the 53 to $54 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to an outspoken advocate for the hardworking families of Ohio and all Americans, Ms. Kaptur of Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I rise today in reluctant opposition to the rules on both housing bills that are before us because they are not coming up before us in regular order. Neither one is an open rule on such an important subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly want to thank Chairman Frank and Congresswoman Waters for their efforts to improve these bills as they move forward. But on a matter so serious, the membership should be afforded the respect our offices bestow to represent their people and be allowed to amend and be heard in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Every day, between 7,000 and 8,000 American households lose their homes to foreclosure. Meanwhile, the banks responsible are being rescued by the Federal Reserve, an instrument of our government. Today, the major bills before us to assist with foreclosures will unleash the power of the taxpayer-insured Federal Housing Administration to catch some of the homeowners in its rescue net. But these bills do nothing to hold the lenders and servicers responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the promise of rescue hotlines and Federal and State government compacts, Federal action to help homeowners being foreclosed lacks bite. It is voluntary. It pushes to the FHA what the private sector should be making whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two plans to be considered today, again, ask mortgage servicers to voluntarily, and I underline that word voluntarily, enter into an agreement with the FHA to insure these troubled loans if servicers offer modest loan concessions. The problem: The voluntary aspect of the program leaves homeowners yet again at the mercy of the mortgage loan holder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take Countrywide. The CEO of that company had his compensation approach over $200 million, with salaries, bonuses, options, and everything over the last 5 years. Yet the Federal Reserve still rewards Countrywide as one of its privileged primary dealers trading in U.S. Government securities. The FHA rescue plan promises to save maybe 500,000 homeowners, or half a million Americans. That equals maybe 25 percent of the more than 2 million additional homeowners still at risk of foreclosure. Let me  ask, is helping 25 percent, perhaps, of homeowners at risk the best America can do? Because the bills are not being considered under an open rule with the ability to amend, we cannot perfect this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it's fair to ask, where have these voluntary rescue plans gotten us so far? Housing counselors in my area tell me dozens of servicers refuse even to come to the table and return phone calls, for heaven's sake. Not restructuring the loan is one thing but not picking up the phone is another. When servicers refuse to answer the phone, no degree of local government effort or foreclosure prevention counseling can be effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who is not picking up the phone? Some of these characters:  CitiFinancial, HSBC/Beneficial, Chase Mortgage, Countrywide, Sovereign Bank, Indymac Bank, Popular Mortgage, GMAC, NovaStar, EMC Mortgage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In fact, the Federal Reserve still has among its privileged list of primary Treasury security dealers Countrywide, HSBC, and Citigroup, some of the very companies that aren't answering the telephone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Banks and mortgage servicers should be mandated to disclose contact information, phone numbers, and lay services for their loss mitigation departments. Citizens attempting to do workouts on loans must have these recalcitrant institutions at the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, as I've said for months, forthcoming improvements to the bill should include a short-term foreclosure moratorium, perhaps 3 months, to help hundreds of thousands of Americans avoid foreclosure. And, most importantly, Congress should vote again on allowing judges the flexibility to modify the terms of mortgage loans in bankruptcy court proceedings. Frankly, the Senate should filibuster on this issue. In other words, do for the homeowner what the Federal Reserve has done for the big  banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without enacting tougher legislation, a "no" vote on this rule and the one to follow will allow for a more effective set of bills to come before us that will really address the comprehensive foreclosure needs of the American people. I'm glad to see the progress we've made, but we could go so much further.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>One of the reasons we are objecting to this is because of the previous question. Can you mention the previous question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question so that we can address another issue of tremendous import in this country that has hit every family, and that's the high prices of gasoline. So I will ask my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question so we can address issues, allow Members on the floor to be able to debate the issue of lower gas prices.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>So a "no" vote on the previous question allows us to debate lowering energy costs in this country; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>It would give us the opportunity to do that because there are some ideas here. The gentleman is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>And that would be in conjunction and probably would meet with the Speaker's promise in 2006 that Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. She made that quote. That would allow us to bring that plan to the floor, would it not?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, the gentleman is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>Likewise, JIM CLYBURN said, "House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices." That would allow us to find out what that plan is; am I correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, the gentleman is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>And when STENY HOYER said, "Democrats believe we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices," that would allow us to address the majority leader's plan to help bring down energy prices; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, the gentleman is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>And it's tied to this debate, and I know my colleague who just spoke, it would probably be important for her to vote "no" on the previous question so that some of her concerns would be aired; would that be correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, I think every Member should allow every Member the opportunity to address these issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Speaker, high energy costs really affect this debate because high energy costs are causing people to make tough decisions where they can't meet their bill payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last year the cost for natural gas for an individual homeowner went up 5.9 percent. Just last year the price for home heating increased 37.2 percent. The cost for propane increased 22.2 percent. The cost for electricity increased 4.3 percent. Why? We have no plan. The Democrat plan to lower energy costs was no plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a plan. It did this: Crude oil was at $58.31 when the Democrats came into the majority. Today, $121. Yesterday it hit $122. I've been doing this for 4 weeks. It hasn't gone down; it keeps going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has that done at the pump? When Democrats came into control, $2.33. What is it today? On average, $3.60. That's no plan. That's a plan to fail. That's higher costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want people to be able to meet their mortgage payments, let's lower energy costs. Let's lower the price of a gallon of gasoline.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman 1 additional minute.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>Now bring in climate change. On average, climate change is going to add 50 cents to a gallon of gas. That would raise the price to $4.16. Nobody wants to pay that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we solve this problem, Mr. Speaker? Let's go after our natural resources in the Outer Continental Shelf. Billions of barrels of oil, billions of cubic feet of natural gas right on the OCS. Democrats keep blocking the ability to get that. Let's do coal-to-liquid technologies. Go after our coal reserves, 250 years' worth in Southern Illinois alone, and turn that into liquid fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's lower the cost for homeowners so that we don't have to rely on bailouts, we don't have to rely on government. My individuals want independence from government. They want independence on fuel costs. They want to pay lower costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats can bring a bill to the floor. They promised it in 2006. We have yet to see it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, as well as <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill> and <bill type="h" number="5720">H.R. 5720</bill>, which together constitute a comprehensive package of legislation that will help us address our Nation's housing crisis by providing assistance to those who are suffering the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The numbers characterizing this crisis are truly staggering. The National Association of Realtors reports that median home prices fell in 2007 by nearly 2 percent. RealtyTrac reported last week that in the first quarter of 2008, 1 in every 194 homeowners faced a foreclosure notice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The loss of a home, or value in a home, is a loss of an asset which many Americans often work their entire lives to own, and it is a loss of a dream that many may never again have the chance to achieve for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the decline of the housing market has pulled our economy to the brink of recession. Our Nation has lost some 260,000 jobs since January of this year, and economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2008 to less than 1 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is that many Americans long ago entered their own personal recessions. And the legislation before us today finally begins to provide the aid that our Nation's families so urgently need to get back on their feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, these pieces of legislation will do the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Provide mortgage refinancing assistance to keep families from losing their homes and protect the values of neighboring homes; expand FHA assistance so that borrowers in danger of losing their homes can refinance into lower-cost, government-insured mortgages they can afford to repay; and provide States $10 billion in additional tax-exempt bond authority in 2008 to refinance subprime loans and refinance the building of affordable and rental housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for their determined leadership and for these great pieces of legislation, and I urge the adoption of each of these measures.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?</paragraph>
