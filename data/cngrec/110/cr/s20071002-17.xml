    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier today, I left a Banking Committee hearing to go out to Arlington National Cemetery to meet with a group of World War II veterans. A woman by the name of Ms. Best, who had served in World War II, was laying the wreath on behalf of Miami County, OH, veterans--some 35 or so veterans from Ohio who took a bus under the sponsorship of Glenn Devers, who raises money so veterans can come to Washington and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and then proceed  to see the World War II monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was struck, first, by all the stories of Mr. and Mrs. Whited, for instance. Mr. Whited was called off to the service and went overseas. His child was born a few months after he left, and when he returned, he saw his son for the first time, who was the age of 2. He is now more than 60 years old. I was taken by the stories of so many of these World War II veterans, their courage and heroism, their love of country, their duty, their commitment, and their patriotism. They surely--without overusing  the phrase--were part of "the greatest generation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few veterans have asked for credit or recognition, but it was such a pleasure to go there and talk to them today. I  had one request of them. Of course, I thanked them over and over. I had one request, and that was that these veterans, both men and women, tell their stories to their children and grandchildren. My father, a World War II veteran who enlisted about a year after Pearl Harbor, sometime during 1942, and went overseas, he didn't talk about  it much. He passed away 6 years ago at the age of 89. He didn't talk about it much. I encouraged these men and women who served our country valiantly in World War II--or any veteran since then--to share the stories with their children and grandchildren because</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought of that visit yesterday before I made the visit, as I was planning it. I thought yesterday, when the Senate passed the Defense reauthorization bill, of an amendment that Congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan and I have been working on. Currently, the Department of Defense--prior to this amendment--is allowed to use any combination of air, rail or road transportation to bring the body of a fallen soldier home. But what has been done, because the rule is so broad, the law is so  broad, the Department of Defense in many cases has brought the body of a soldier killed in action to the nearest big city airport, which could be 50, 100, 200 or 300 miles away. Congressman Stupak represents an area in northern Michigan, the Upper Peninsula, and often bodies are brought back to Green Bay, which is too far from many of these families who have to go to an airport that is 2 or</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were able to get the fallen servicemember respectful return amendment included in the Department of Defense bill. This means that when our soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country, the least the Government and the DOD can do--and for reasons I don't even understand they had failed to do. We talk so much about honoring our soldiers, but they failed to do this. All of the money we are spending--hundreds of billions of dollars--and they didn't get these bodies back  to the funeral home in the local communities. It is incumbent upon us to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Stupak in the House and my amendment in the Senate finally has done that. The least we can do is ease the path for these families as they confront their loss.</paragraph>
