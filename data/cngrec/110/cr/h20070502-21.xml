  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest national liabilities is our overwhelming dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and the men and women of  south central Michigan continue to stress to me the importance of diversifying our Nation's energy portfolio and advancing cleaner-burning, home-grown, renewable energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week I will introduce legislation, the Energy Independence through Bio-Diesel Act, that will continue the process of moving our country towards energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating a national standard for bio-diesel will encourage the technology and economies of scale necessary to make America the leader in renewable sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Independence through Bio-Diesel Act would create a 2 percent standard for bio-diesel and amend the Clean Air Act to require that within 5 years all diesel fuel sold contains a 2 percent industry average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty-five billion gallons of diesel were consumed in 2005, and a 2 percent standard would create a 1.1-billion-gallon market. This standard will help spur the necessary investments in facilities and technological advancements needed in this alternative fuel industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to commit to diversifying our energy supply and lessen our dangerous dependence on foreign energy by supporting the Energy Independence through Bio-Diesel Act.</paragraph>
