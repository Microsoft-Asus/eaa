  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Millions of children in the United States suffer from vision problems, many of which go undetected. Because children with vision problems can struggle developmentally, resulting in physical, emotional, and social consequences, good vision is essential for proper physical development and educational progress.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Vision problems in children range from common conditions such as refractive errors, amblyopia, strabismus, ocular trauma, and infections, to rare but potentially life- or sight-threatening problems such as retinoblastoma, infantile cataracts, congenital glaucoma, and genetic or metabolic diseases of the eye.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Since many serious ocular conditions are treatable if identified in the preschool and early school-age years, early detection provides the best opportunity for effective treatment and can have far-reaching implications for vision.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Various identification methods, including vision screening and comprehensive eye examinations required by State laws, can be helpful in identifying children needing services. A child identified as needing services through vision screening should receive a comprehensive eye examination followed by subsequent treatment as needed. Any child identified as needing services should have access to subsequent treatment as needed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) There is a need to increase public awareness about the prevalence and devastating consequences of vision disorders in children and to educate the public and health care providers about the warning signs and symptoms of ocular and vision disorders and the benefits of early detection, evaluation, and treatment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. GRANTS REGARDING VISION CARE FOR CHILDREN.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the "Secretary"), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may award grants to States on the basis of an established review process for the purpose of complementing existing State efforts for--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) providing comprehensive eye examinations by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist for children who have been previously identified through a vision screening or eye examination by a licensed health care provider or vision screener as needing such services, with priority given to children who are under the age of 9 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) providing treatment or services, subsequent to the examinations described in paragraph (1), necessary to correct vision problems; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) developing and disseminating, to parents, teachers, and health care practitioners, educational materials on recognizing signs of visual impairment in children.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Criteria and Coordination.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) CRITERIA.--The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate professional and patient organizations including individuals with knowledge of age appropriate vision services, shall develop criteria--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) governing the operation of the grant program under subsection (a); and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) for the collection of data related to vision assessment and the utilization of follow-up services.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill>, the Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A small but significant portion of children have visual impairments. It is estimated that vision impairment affects approximately 1.2 out of every 1,000 8-year-olds. When detected early, many childhood vision abnormalities are treatable, but the potential for correction and normal visual development diminishes with age. Vision problems can occur at any point during a lifetime, but tend to be particularly damaging to school-age children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Impaired vision can result in adverse physical, emotional, and social consequences. For instance, a child may miss learning opportunities by failing to explore his or her environment. Additionally, if a child is visually impaired, he or she may be unable to imitate social behavior or understand nonverbal cues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early recognition of eye disease results in more effective treatment and that can be sight saving and sometimes even life saving. Yet, many children under the age of five do not receive any vision screening at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007 would authorize a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams for uninsured children with vision disorders, with priority for children under the age of 9. Funds would be used for treatment and services to correct vision disorders identified through eye exams and to increase public awareness of visual impairment in children. <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill> would require States receiving funds to contribute a 25 percent match of funds for each Federal dollar obtained through  the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today makes great strides in providing access to an array of vision-related services, including vision screening services that can help uninsured children in low- to moderate-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues for their commitment and strong support of this legislation, and particularly commend my dear friend and colleague, Representative Gene Green, for his unwavering dedication to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this vital and important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill>, the Vision Care for Kids Act, and join my colleague in asking for its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at the outset, let me thank a few individuals for bringing this bill to the floor: of course, Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton. I'd also like to thank Representatives Green, Sullivan, and Engel for their leadership and support in bringing the Vision Care for Kids Act to the floor, and Mr. Pascrell, who's been very, very passionate about this issue for many years. I've had the privilege and pleasure of working with him, and I know how  passionate he is, like so many of us, to get quality vision care for kids who need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've been working on this bill for about 6 years; and after countless modifications, negotiations and compromise, I'm proud to say we have a bill that is unanimously supported by the entire vision community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And my colleague from Wisconsin put it very simply: there are many kids today who have problems with their eyes; who have an inability to see properly; who, if left untreated, obviously, leads to negative consequence in social interaction, not to mention their poor performance in school and academic achievement because of their inability to see, and not to mention the fact that they're not getting the appropriate care that in some cases leads to greater illnesses and in some cases leads to death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we hope to pass today represents the kind of quality, sound public policy that can only come about through the bipartisan cooperation and a willingness to compromise by many interested parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill> represents a responsible and sensible approach to public health. It's well documented that without the adequate access to vision screening and treatment for eye disorders, a child's entire learning and development can be adversely affected. And we say that for children who do not qualify for a public program and did not have health insurance, our assisting in catching potentially eye disorders is critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill strikes an effective balance with a shared relationship between Federal and State governments. Once States have identified, through the screening mechanism of their choice, that a child may have an eye disorder, this legislation will provide Federal funding for follow-up comprehensive eye exam and the necessary treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By incorporating a three-to-one Federal-State match, we maintain incentives for States to run their programs efficiently, providing additional assurances to taxpayers that we're maximizing the use of each dollar spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Vision Council of America, Prevent Blindness  of America, the American Optometric Association for their support of the legislation, that of my colleague, and know full well that if this bill does become law, there will be children who currently don't have access to quality treatment that will get the treatment they deserve and need so that they can live a more full and healthy and happy life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a passionate advocate of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin), who is a model of sensitivity to the needs of all of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Fossella, who's been at the forefront of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today regarding an issue that has long been near to my heart. I've been listening to these other bills that have been put forth in bipartisan fashion. This is a good example of what we can do together when it comes to our children, their health care and their education. This is critical. This is important. So anybody who says we can't do it is not listening today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone for their thoughtful consideration and support for preventive vision care for children. Many a kid has been put in the back of the class or sent out of the room because it was misinterpreted, misunderstood, and many times, that child had a problem with vision, with seeing and was too embarrassed to say so, or couldn't recognize it within himself. So preventive vision care is critically important to avoid vision loss and  blindness in our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Untreated vision problems can affect a child's physical, educational, and emotional development. That is why for many years, as my good friend from Staten Island has pointed out, we have fought for legislation to set up a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams and the necessary follow-up care for children whose families do not have the resources or access to such care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Center for Disease Control states that approximately 1.8 million children under the age of 18 are blind or have some form of visual impairment. Fortunately, vision loss can be avoided with early diagnosis and treatment. That is not so revealing, is it? On any such disease, early vision, early problems affecting vision, early problems affecting hearing, early problems of detection of teeth, et cetera, et cetera, many of these visual deficits are caught only after they have impaired the child's  early and most critical education. That's the rub.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eye health has a direct impact on learning and achievement. That's the core of the fight that we have waged. It is a national disgrace, Madam Speaker, that only one in three children receive preventive vision care before they are enrolled in elementary school. That's not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm pleased to introduce this, along with Congressman Gene Green, and there are many others that we need to salute here who have fought this fight with us, and that is Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Representative John Boozman. Senator Kit Bond on the other side of the building has waged that fight over there. A truly bipartisan effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's so easy. I know it's difficult for us as Congressmen to understand that, including myself. But it's so easy that we can come together when the problem is defined and we can work together, together on a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's a perfect example. The seven bills, the eight bills that we just have gone through, Commerce, these affect people's lives. They're not esoteric. They're not up in the sky someplace. These affect people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill> will establish a Federal grant program to provide for timely diagnostic examination, treatment and follow-up vision care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will complement existing State programs and allow eye exams for a vulnerable pediatric population that does not qualify for Medicaid and does not qualify for SCHIP and do not have access to private health insurance. Critical that we understand this. Very important here. Very significant for those families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Better eye care will significantly mitigate the effects of visual impairment. So it's important to act now, Madam Speaker. The prevention is more than half the battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Vision Care for Kids Act. Kids out there are waiting for us in all 50 States to act on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Fossella. Thank you to my good friend, the gentlelady from Wisconsin. And I think that we've hit a home run here for the last hour and a half, thanks to you both.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the lead author of this bill, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague on our Energy and Commerce Committee and Health Subcommittee for allowing me to rush in from the airport to be able to put a statement on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise, obviously, in support of <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill>, the Vision Care for Kids Act. This bill has been crafted in a very bipartisan fashion with the leadership of my colleagues, Mr. Fossella, Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Engel, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I'd like to thank them for their dedication to children's vision issues in this legislation in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vision Care for Kids Act establishes a much-needed grant program to provide follow-up vision care to uninsured children with vision disorders. As we tried to target the program to the children most in need, we learned very quickly that a child's access to vision screening and comprehensive vision care varies widely depending on individual State laws. For example, some States have no vision screening requirements, whereas 30 States currently mandate vision screening. Twenty-eight of these  States with screening mandates, however, do not have or offer any guarantee that children who fail the screening will receive a follow-up eye exam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a nationwide basis, as many as 80 percent of the children who fail a vision screening do not get the follow-up care they need. Among the parents of these children, 25 percent cite financial constraints as a primary reason their child does not receive important follow-up care more than any other factor influencing their lack of care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This lack of vision care jeopardizes a child's development and can unfortunately lead to lifelong vision impairment. These children deserve a healthy start to their educational and social development, yet the reality is that nearly two of three children entering elementary school have never received preventive vision care. Unfortunately, the lack of health experience presents a barrier to the delivery of appropriate vision care in this country. For many children who are lucky enough to have health  insurance for medical care, their policy doesn't cover vision coverage. This is precisely why this bill is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>By targeting the program toward children who are school age, uninsured, and at risk for vision disorders, the bill is designed to spend scarce health care dollars in the wisest manner possible. A portion of the grant funds will also be used to increase education and awareness of vision disorders so that the warning signs can be recognized and any problems can be detected in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the committee consideration of this legislation, we made several changes in the underlying bill. Specifically, we clarified that the Secretary should consult with professional and patient organizations when developing the criteria associated with the grant program's operations and data collection. This amendment also specifies an authorization level of $65 million over 5 years and includes a State-matching requirement of 25 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The compromise could not have been developed without the dedication of key members of the vision community, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Optometric Association, the Vision Council of America, and Prevent Blindness America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a founding member of the Congressional Vision Caucus, I am particularly pleased to see this bill on the House floor today and consider it a milestone for our very young caucus. In 2003, I joined my colleagues David Price, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Pat Tiberi in establishing the Congressional Vision Caucus. Today the Vision Caucus is comprised of more than 100 Members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, House Members and Senators. While our initial goal was to raise  the awareness of vision disorders in Congress, the caucus has developed and endorsed two key pieces of vision legislation, including the Vision Care for Kids Act before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is particularly gratifying to see our efforts result in legislative success, and I thank the members of the Vision Caucus and the 152 cosponsors of this legislation for their support. I would also like to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton of the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, Mr. Pallone and Mr. Deal, for their support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would also like to thank John Ford and William Garner of the committee's majority staff for their expertise, as well as Ryan Long and Katherine Martin of the minority staff for their willingness to work with us in a bipartisan fashion on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I encourage my colleagues to join us in passing this important bill to improve vision care for America's children.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me again, in closing, thank the sponsors, Mr. Green and, of course, Mr. Pascrell for really helping us to get to this point. I failed to mention Ms. Ros-Lehtinen before. She was instrumental as well, and Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Engel. Let me commend and thank my colleague Ms. Baldwin for her eloquence in shepherding all these bills to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it relates to this bill, early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment, we know that those are the magical things that have to happen in order for a child to lead a more forward, healthy life. Without the access to the care that a child needs, we know that that life is going to be compromised in some way, shape, or form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that this bill helps to get us to that point. I think it will help a lot of children who currently have no help and no access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Ryan McKee from my office, who has worked on this bill for several years in our efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, visual impairments can have lifelong consequences for children. As we have heard, this bill will help identify these impairments early so that our kids can live up to their full potential. This bill and the others that preceded it are prime examples of bipartisan cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill and those that have preceded it. And I also thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) for his assistance in expeditiously, yet comprehensively, managing the nine vital important and bipartisan health bills that were before us this afternoon.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill>, the Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue is simple, Madam Speaker, kids can't learn if they can't see. Providing early vision screening for our nation's children will make sure they are all ready to learn when they enter school and the Vision Care for Kids Act will help provide states with the means to offer this important care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was in the Connecticut State Senate, I championed an initiative which made school-based vision screening a priority through the mandated reporting of pediatric vision screening on school health assessment forms. The passage of today's legislation will enhance my state's ability to enhance vision programs for children by providing a much needed federal stream of funding. Importantly, it will allow Connecticut's children to receive followup care when uninsured children are identified through  my state's existing vision screening program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of today's legislation is another example of how this Congress is actively working to provide health services to our nation's children. This week, as the House contemplates whether we should provide 10 million American children with health insurance through the SCHIP program, we should take today as an opportunity to affirm our commitment to comprehensive health screening and coverage for all American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill> and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="507">H.R. 507</bill> Care for Kids Act of 2007. As you know, this bill would award grants to states to: (1) provide comprehensive eye examinations by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist for children identified by a licensed health care provider or vision screener, with priority to children under age nine; (2) provide treatment or services to correct vision problems of such children; and (3) develop and disseminate educational materials on  recognizing signs of visual impairment in children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, studies have shown that African-Americans were most likely to report that they do not have a regular eye care professional (21 percent). And Hispanics were least likely to have seen an eye care professional in the last year (43 percent).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like many diseases, vision problems can disproportionately affect certain ethnic groups. For example, African-Americans are five times more likely to have glaucoma, Hispanics are at the greatest risk for cataracts, and myopia or near-sightedness is much more common among Asians than other ethnic groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the story doesn't end there, a new study by University of Michigan pediatricians suggests that poor, uninsured, black and Hispanic children are getting the least vision care services in this country. In all, non-Hispanic and non-black children were 47 percent more likely than Hispanic children--and 59 percent more likely than black children--to have received eye care in the last year. In addition, the study showed that uninsured black or Hispanic children were less likely than uninsured children  of other races or ethnicities to have corrective lenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam speaker, we have to do better on providing care to these communities and giving these communities the healthcare professionals to deliverer such care. To date, the current enrollment percentages of African-American and Hispanic students in optometry school is dismal at best. In the United States, only 3.5 percent of currently enrolled optometry students are African American. Hispanics do not fare much better, when including the InterAmerican University of Puerto Rico, the enrollment of  Hispanics in U.S. optometry schools and Canada is even lower than that of African Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Madam Speaker while I strongly support this bill we must do more to address these disparities. Thus, the reason behind my outspoken wish to mandate vision care to the State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) reauthorization. The lack of vision care for children can not be tolerated in this country and I look forward to working with the Congress in bringing this issue to the forefront of our debate around SCHIP.</paragraph>
