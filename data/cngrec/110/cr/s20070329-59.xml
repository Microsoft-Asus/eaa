  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are objections on this side. I, therefore, have to object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would say, very briefly, Senator Landrieu has spoken at great length on this issue. Senator Lott has talked to me several times about this issue. I hope we can get this cleared in the near future.</paragraph>
