    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the life of a highly respected and gifted Baptist pastor, Caesar Arthur Walter Clark, Sr. Born on December 13, 1914, in Shreveport, LA, Reverend Clark spent his life devoted to the teaching of his faith, blessing many around the State and Nation by his work. He died Sunday, July 27, 2008, at age 93 in Dallas, where he spent more than five decades preaching at Good Street Baptist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Clark showed his passion for preaching throughout his life, starting as a 19-year-old pastor of the Israelite Baptist Church in Longstreet, LA, where his fiery sermons earned him the nickname "Little Caesar." After joining Good Street Baptist Church in 1950, Reverend Clark helped build the church into a 5,000 member congregation. It was through his work with the local NAACP chapter that Reverend Clark met Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and invited him to give a speech hosted by  Good Street Baptist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Clark cared as much about the presentation of his sermons as the presentation of his actions. He sought to live what he preached to the best of his ability, becoming a mentor to many. As a result, Reverend Clark's sphere of influence extended far beyond the pulpit. For example, he worked to improve the lives of his parishioners and members of the community by opening daycare centers, a credit union, a legal clinic, and low-income housing. In addition, he served as vice president of the  National Baptist Convention and as president of the Missionary Baptist Association of Texas. Reverend Clark's service touched many lives; in particular, Reverend R.E. Price, pastor at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Dallas. Reverend Price said, "Dr. Clark was a man of great integrity and a speaker for all occasions. It was a privilege to serve with him in various leadership roles as his advice was always sage. Most of all, he was my friend."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Clark's accomplishments as a pastor and civic leader have earned him the respect and admiration of many. He leaves a legacy of good works, a mighty faith, and a purpose-filled life. I join with his family and friends in celebrating Reverend Clark for his long life of service to God and community.</paragraph>
