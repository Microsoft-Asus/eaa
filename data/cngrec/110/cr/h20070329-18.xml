    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the Bishop Guilfoyle High School girls basketball team from Altoona, Pennsylvania, for their record-breaking season which ended with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) Class A State Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lady Marauders, who finished this season with an impressive 31-1 record, went 14-0 in league play and defeated Pittsburgh's North Catholic  High School 43-38 for the 2007 championship title on March 24.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The season high of 31 wins set a school record and accompanied their first State title in 14 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coached by Coach Mark Moschella, the team is graduating six seniors, led by senior forward Mary Forr, a 1,000-point scorer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also playing their last game were Courtney Carroll, Heather Craig, Ashley Helsel, Rachel Sullivan, and Dani Williams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And special note, Alli Williams, a freshman on the Lady Marauders, scored 13 points and finished with 10 rebounds in the championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud of the hard work and dedication of these young women from Bishop Guilfoyle and congratulate the team, the coaching staff, and their fans on a story-book year and a deserved championship.</paragraph>
