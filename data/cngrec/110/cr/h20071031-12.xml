    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush is continuing to oppose a bipartisan plan to give 10 million children the health care they need. This morning, the Associated Press reported that President Bush will veto any plan that raises the resources necessary to fund children's health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats in Congress disagree with the President on this issue. But the President is content to continue to stand between 10 million children and their health care. The President's refusal to move forward could have serious consequences for middle-class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New York Times reported today that 21 States will run out of money for children's health care this year if the spending for the SCHIP program continues only at current levels. The parents of these children earn a paycheck, not a welfare check. Millions of children and their parents are counting on this President and Republicans in Congress to offer more than an emergency room as health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same children who are counting on the President to act will celebrate Halloween this evening and President Bush won't miss out on the fun. At 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, President Bush is having what he calls an SCHIP Halloween. It's all trick, no treat. He's preventing health care coverage for millions of kids.</paragraph>
