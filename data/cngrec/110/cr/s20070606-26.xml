    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a community in North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 3-8, the residents of Hettinger will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hettinger is a vibrant community in southwest North Dakota. Hettinger holds an important place in North Dakota's history. The townsite was founded in 1907, and Erastus A. Williams of Bismarck, whose son-in-law was Mathias Hettinger, was credited with naming the community. It became the county seat of Adams County in 1907. The post office was established in May 17, 1907, and Hettinger was organized into a city in 1916. One of the last living survivors of the Titanic, Ole Abelseth, was a longtime  resident of Hettinger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Hettinger is a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts who come to enjoy bird watching, fishing, and big game hunting. Nearby Mirror Lake offers camping and other outdoor activities for all ages. In 2004, Hettinger was recognized as Hometown of the Year by the Bismarck Tribune and it received the North Dakota Capital Community Designation by the Federal Home Loan  Bank, which recognized Hettinger's vision and planning in sustaining and revitalizing the  local economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Hettinger are enthusiastic about their community and the quality of life it offers. Hettinger has a wonderful centennial celebration planned that includes dances, a steak fry, a lumberjack show, a parade, a horseshoe tournament, class reunions, and a whisker growing contest. The week long celebration will definitely be one to remember.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Hettinger, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the next century. By honoring Hettinger and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Hettinger that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hettinger has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
