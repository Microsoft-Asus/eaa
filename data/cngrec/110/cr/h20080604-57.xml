  <narrative>ENERGY SAVINGS -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4963]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats have fought to bring America's addiction to oil to the forefront of our national attention for years. We must reduce our dependence on oil in order to stimulate the economy, to protect our country and to curb the harmful effects of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Democrats gained control of the Congress last year, we raised automobile fuel efficiency standards for the first time in over a quarter of a century, despite the opposition of President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the House recently passed a comprehensive renewable energy bill. Our renewable energy bill will reduce America's dependence on oil. It will lower energy costs, protect the environment, and create hundreds of thousands of new skilled green jobs all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Congress is working hard to reduce our oil dependence, my constituents are working hard to do their part to battle rising energy prices and reduce their own carbon footprint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently asked my constituents to tell me what they were doing to reduce their personal energy consumption and to reduce the cost of energy in their monthly lives, and I promised that I would share some of these best ideas right here on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are some of the comments I've received so far. Many of my constituents are already following some of the more conventional but important methods of energy conservation, including replacing traditional light bulbs with compact fluorescent lights, unplugging appliances that aren't in  use, drying clothes outside in the California sun. Many more are taking advantage of public transportation options throughout Northern California and the San Francisco  Bay area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patricia Kneisler of Benicia, California, gangs all of her errands together. By doing this, as she says, her "gas guzzler," the 1995 SUV, is only used when absolutely necessary and in the most efficient manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gina Hale's family in Pittsburg, California, attached ultraviolet blocking film on all of the house's windows to cut down on air conditioning costs during the summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Melissa Miller of Concord, California runs her dishwasher only when it is full and at night when the electricity rates go down after 7 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have posted on my Web site sources of information about how consumers can reduce their energy consumption and save money and help protect the environment. I invite you to visit my Web site. While you're there, post&#xD0; your own comments about your ideas&#xD0; of saving energy. It's at www.georgemiller.house.gov.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small changes have big impacts. Not only are my constituents reducing their own energy bills, but they're also contributing to our future energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress can and must continue to support all of the individuals who are working to reduce energy consumption. We must work to pass legislation that invests in renewable energy, encourages innovation and investment in green technology and supports the creation of green jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress is obligated to move America into the future, into a modern energy policy, and stop the reliance on the past fossil fuels policy that has kept this country in bondage to the oil companies and to the suppliers from overseas. Our economy and our environment depend upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a tragedy that President Bush and 12 years of a Republican Congress stood in the way of energy independence, stood in the way of a modern energy program. While the President told the Nation and Congress that we're addicted to oil, he did nothing to alter that addiction--nothing other than to call for more oil drilling. Spoken like a true addict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time to move forward. The price of gas and oil is at a crisis to America's families, and we must act quickly and boldly to come to grips with this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our future depends upon reducing our demand for oil, increasing energy efficiency, and providing sustainable energy sources to relieve consumers of the crippling energy costs that invade their lives on a daily basis and to stimulate the next generation of innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the contributions of my constituents, and I look forward to hearing from more of them and to bring them to the attention of the House to see what decisions they're making about reducing energy costs in their personal daily lives.</paragraph>
