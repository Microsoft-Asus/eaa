  <narrative>DEVELOPMENT, RELIEF, AND EDUCATION FOR ALIEN MINORS ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - October 22, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13202">S13202</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate will have an opportunity to consider and adopt the DREAM Act. I have, again, cosponsored Senator Durbin's initiative along with Senators Lugar and Hagel and urge all Senators to join us in proceeding to consideration of <bill type="s" number="2205">S.2205</bill>, the latest version of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DREAM Act was first introduced in 2001, during the 107th Congress. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill with bipartisan support in 2002 and, again, in 2003 during the 108th Congress. When the Senate Judiciary Committee took up comprehensive immigration reform in 2006 during the 109th Congress, the DREAM Act was adopted by voice vote as an amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform bill reported by the Judiciary Committee, and it was included in the comprehensive immigration  reform measure that the Senate ultimately passed in 2006. Senator Durbin worked hard to have the DREAM Act included in the bill the Senate took up this past summer. I hope the spirit of bipartisanship that has been evident throughout this bill's history in the Senate can carry it to final passage this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill sets the right tone and policy. It seeks to enhance educational opportunities for thousands of young people who wish to enter college, but who are prevented from doing so due to circumstances over which they have little control. We should send the clear signal that the Senate majority is committed to doing what it can to move positive immigration reforms forward. It makes good sense to invest in our future by enhancing educational opportunities for our Nation's young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children brought to the United States by their parents or guardians  occupy a unique position in our society. They are technically illegal in status, but the Supreme Court has determined that these children are not responsible for the actions of their parents for purposes of elementary and secondary public education, recognizing that we disserve ourselves when we discriminate against them. The DREAM Act builds upon the rationale underlying the Supreme  Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe in the interest of strengthening our Nation's future. It builds upon the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon graduation from high school, thousands of talented young people find themselves without the legal status to obtain aid to attend college. The DREAM Act would give currently undocumented eligible young people the conditional legal status they need to allow them to obtain assistance to attend college or to join our military and eventually to obtain permanent legal residency and citizenship. Those who would benefit from the DREAM Act are young people we should be encouraging to follow their  dreams. The status quo, in which our policies create barriers to advancement for so many young people who yearn to achieve and contribute, works to the disadvantage of the United States. Rather than barring young people from entering the American mainstream, we should strengthen our Nation's future through increased participation in higher education and in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senate prepares to take up the DREAM Act, I hope that those who opposed comprehensive immigration reform will pause to consider the very real benefits the DREAM Act will bring. Let the Senate do the right thing, endorse the DREAM Act and reinforce the American dream for all.</paragraph>
