  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the body that we stand in is the people's House. It is our obligation to address the grievances of the people who petition us. Thank goodness today, by reforming the prescription drug benefit part D, <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill> addressed the grievances of millions and millions of seniors and small pharmaceutical companies or pharmacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventy-five percent of the drug program is paid by taxpayers. Thank goodness that we worked today on behalf of seniors who have suffered for years facing that terrible doughnut hole. Thank goodness we are negotiating a cheaper price. Thank goodness we are doing like the veterans hospitals are doing for veterans. Thank goodness we have corrected that 6-hour open vote of sheer despair, of pressuring all of the Members of Congress to vote the way our Republican friends wanted them to do, which  is vote the worst prescription drug benefit program we have ever had in America. We did a disservice to Medicare. Today we fixed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad for seniors we stood up so they could be heard.</paragraph>
