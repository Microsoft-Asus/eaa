    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the 200th Anniversary of Putnam County, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Putnam County was created by an act of the Georgia Assembly on December 10, 1807. It was laid out from Baldwin County and lies in the heart of Georgia's Piedmont region. It was named for one of the most noted patriots of the Revolutionary War, GEN Israel Putnam of Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Eatonton was founded as the seat of Putnam County in 1808 and was incorporated the following year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known as the "Dairy Capital of Georgia," Putnam County is also home to  Rock Eagle 4-H Center. The Rock Eagle Mound is 102 feet long and 120 feet wide. It is believed to have been built by Native Americans over 2,000 years ago and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Putnam County is also the birthplace of several famous Georgians, including journalist and author Joel Chandler Harris, author Alice Walker, and Chick-fil-a founder  and CEO S. Truett Cathy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of Putnam County to the State of Georgia. I congratulate this great county on its 200th anniversary.</paragraph>
