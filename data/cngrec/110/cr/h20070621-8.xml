  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this House has repeatedly passed the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act to authorize Federal funds to be used for lifesaving research on embryonic stem cell lines that would otherwise be discarded. This type of research, conducted under strict ethical standards, is supported by an overwhelming number of Americans because of the hope it offers for the potential cures of many diseases, such as diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer and MS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But yesterday, President Bush once again vetoed this important bill. In an attempt to save face, the President instead signed an executive order that will do little to advance essential medical research. The symbolic order is the President's attempt to score political points, but it fails to direct new resources or support for potentially lifesaving research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A majority of this House and a majority of the American people are fed up with the Bush administration's stifling of this important life-affirming science. Democrats will continue to fight to promote important and groundbreaking research so that we can provide real hope to millions of Americans.</paragraph>
