    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against this extremely flawed SCHIP bill. I support the original intent of SCHIP, which is to cover our moderate- to low-income children at 200 percent of the poverty level. Yet the bill before us today goes much further. It does expand the program, and it does move it from a block grant to an entitlement, and it moves patients towards a universal, government-run health care that shifts patients from private care to a massive government entitlement  program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I know what runaway health care costs in a broken system look like. As a former member of the Tennessee Senate, I watched TennCare, Tennessee's statewide Medicaid-managed care service, which was granted under one of those waivers, I have watched this thing invoke stress, pain and hardship on both health care providers and consumers. It does not work. Someone always has to pay the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 10 years, also, this CHAMP bill would make $193 billion worth of cuts from Medicare services for our seniors. It didn't work. It is not going to work here.</paragraph>
