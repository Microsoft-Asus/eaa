  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Judiciary Committee considered a bill to protect chickens, roosters, from being carried across State lines for use in illegal cockfighting. An amendment was offered on a similar "cross State line" issue, protecting minor girls from being carried across State lines for the purpose of having an abortion without their parents' knowledge or consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the committee ultimately passed the animal protections, they wouldn't even allow a vote on protecting young girls. Even more outrageous, the substance of the rejected amendment has passed twice in the House last year, with large bipartisan majorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in case anyone is having trouble following this, let's summarize: by rejecting this amendment, Democrats saw fit to provide greater protections to birds than to minor girls and their parents and unborn children. It is as simple as that. This is supposed to be the year of the children? Not all of the children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Welcome to the Pelosi Congress.</paragraph>
