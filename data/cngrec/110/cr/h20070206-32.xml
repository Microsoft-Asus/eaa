    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we do know that the war in Iraq will come up for debate in this body, as it should. But the debate on this floor should not be about partisan politics. It should be about doing what is in the best interests of our troops, making certain that we win in this global war on terror, and how we are going to keep this Nation and our communities and our cities safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently read a quote from Specialist Tyler Johnson. He is serving his first tour of duty in Iraq. When asked about the criticism back home, he said that passing no-confidence resolutions does send a message to our troops overseas: "You may support or say we support the troops, but you're not supporting what they do, what they're here sweating for, what we bleed for, what we die for. It all just doesn't make sense to me."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with Tyler and our troops. Passing no-confidence resolutions does send a message, and it is not a message of courage, of confidence and strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree, let's support Sam Johnson's House Resolution 511. Stand with and fully fund our troops.</paragraph>
