    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SPEAKER pro tempore: Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Vermont?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was no objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="554">H. Res. 554</bill>. This supports the goals and ideals of National Passport Month. <bill type="hr" number="554">H. Res. 554</bill>, with 55 co-sponsors, was introduced by Representative Barbara Lee on July 27, 2007. It was reported from the Oversight Committee on August 1, 2007, by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the creation and support of a National Passport Month signals to Americans the important role they can play as ambassadors for the United States by serving as agents of understanding, tolerance and mutual respect to citizens of other countries. The use of a passport and the desire to travel to other nations will bring personal enjoyment, enrichment and interest for both traveler and host, yet less than 25 percent of Americans have passports, thereby eliminating their ability to  travel outside the United States. The passport and traveling abroad will create a connection with the global community and support goodwill throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Barbara Lee from California, for supporting the goals and ideals of National Passport Month, and I support and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>September has been recognized by the tourism industry as National Passport Month in an effort to educate the public and increase awareness of the importance of having passports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tourism industry brings in more than $80 billion annually to the U.S. economy. In helping our economy thrive, it also strengthens public diplomacy through each visitor. Similarly, Americans can improve foreign relations by traveling internationally and meeting with citizens of other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opportunities to learn different cultures, view history and exchange ideas are endless for those having passports. Interacting with the global community enables travelers to promote understanding and good will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Passport Month educates the public on the value and positive impact international travel has on individuals. Without passports, these opportunities could not be achieved. So, therefore, Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to support <bill type="hr" number="554">H. Res. 554</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, first let me thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for your leadership and for managing the bill, and also for your clarity of why we are offering this resolution today and for your support. I also thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for your leadership and your support. To the chairman of the committee, Chairman Waxman, and our ranking member, Mr. Davis, I commend them and thank them for working together to bring  this bill to the floor, as well as to our leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to also express my appreciation to the over 60 cosponsors of this bipartisan resolution for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is extremely straightforward. What it does is detail and recognize the value of international travel, and request the President to issue a proclamation calling on the Federal Government, States, localities, schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses and other entities and the people of the United States to observe National Passport Month with appropriate ceremonies, programs and activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of National Passport Month is to create a time to educate the public about the incredible opportunities available to those who obtain passports as well as the positive impact that international travel has on individuals and on our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, and this is quite a revealing statistic, only about 25 percent of Americans have a passport. Twenty-five percent. That means 75 percent of Americans are limited in their ability to travel abroad because they don't have a passport. As a result, they are unable to take advantage of the enriching opportunities presented by international travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the State-Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I understand and appreciate the value and importance of international travel and the impact of our foreign aid and the positive value that our foreign aid brings to those throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many years ago I had the opportunity to live in Great Britain for a couple of years, and can say with certainty that there is no substitute for the experience you get from visiting other countries, from meeting with people, from tasting the food, from interacting with the culture. It changes the way we see the world. It broadens our horizons, it deepens our appreciation for different countries and cultures and our shared humanity. It also helps us to learn, to understand, and to tolerate and  to mutually respect other cultures. Not only does travel provide enriching opportunities for the individual, it can also have profound benefits for our Nation as a whole through people-to-people contact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, having a passport and traveling abroad enables others to see our contributions firsthand, including the tremendous amount of humanitarian aid given by Americans through the public and private sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans of all ages are our best ambassadors, and we should promote policies that encourage them to travel, to forge connections with people from other countries, to foster mutual understanding and tolerance, and to help open new doors for peaceful coexistence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The timing of our efforts could not be more critical. I think we all recognize that America needs a boost in foreign public opinion, and I am confident that connections made with American travelers can and will make a huge difference in improving our image abroad. For all of these reasons, when Lonely Planet, which I am pleased to say is located in Oakland in my district, first raised the idea of a National Passport Month, I immediately got it. I embraced it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have introduced <bill type="hr" number="554">H. Res. 554</bill> and to be a part of this campaign to recognize the importance of international travel, and I am excited by the support we have received.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Lonely Planet presented me with over 5,000 petition signatures from people all over our country who support these efforts, and this campaign has the support of a broad coalition of over 70 supporting travel organizations and associations to corporations like American Express and Yahoo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the Department of State is on record in supporting September as National Passport Month. Let me just read a quote from their letter: "Since September is a time of the year when schools are reopening and many students are considering travel or study abroad, it is a highly appropriate month to promote public awareness of the value of the United States passport. The Department shares your appreciation of the U.S. passport and supports your resolution."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the recent problems with passport backlogs, this resolution is even more timely. The administration must make passports a priority and ensure that we have the resources available to process them in a timely manner. I thank all of the supporters of this resolution.</paragraph>
