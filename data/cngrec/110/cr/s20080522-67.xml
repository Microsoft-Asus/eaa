  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my good friend from Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar, <bill type="sr" number="576">S. Res. 576</bill>, which would designate August 2008 as Digital Television Transition Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pursuant to the Digital Television Transmission and Public Safety Act of 2005, starting on February 17, 2009, full-power television stations will shut down their traditional analog signals and will broadcast in digital only. Concentrating efforts to educate consumers well in advance about both the upcoming transition and their options will ensure as smooth a transition as possible. That is why Senator Klobuchar and I, along with dozens of original cosponsors, have introduced this resolution  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the month of August is a perfect time to highlight the ongoing educational efforts about the transition to digital television next year. After all, we want to encourage those who will need to take some action to do so now, rather than wait until the last moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several studies indicate that many consumers who will be left without any television service after February 17, 2009, may be unaware of the transition and the Government coupon program created to defray the cost of converter boxes. While 64 percent of consumers know about the transition to digital television, 74 percent of that group has major misconceptions about the impact of the transition on their television services. The transition to digital television is especially significant to vulnerable  populations such as senior citizen, low-income, and minority households.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that television markets in the West and Midwest have the highest percentage of consumers who rely on over-the-air television signals. In Utah alone, Salt Lake City has the highest percentage of homes in a major metropolitan area, with almost one in four relying on free analog television signals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Communications Commission, FCC, recently adopted a proposal to educate consumers about the impending transition. In addition, there are many sources of information on the transition, coupon program and consumer options available on the Internet. These Web sites are comprehensive and provide links to the Government coupon program site where consumers must register to receive the coupons. However, these sites do not reach certain populations, those most likely to be affected by the  transition, as effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress can and should do more, not only to educate consumers, but also to foster local outreach programs to assist these consumers as they obtain coupons or choose and install converter boxes. Designating August 2008 as Digital Television Transition Awareness Month, timed specifically to take advantage of the congressional recess, will place particular emphasis on educating consumers well in advance of the transition, and will be an integral part of the overall educational program endorsed  by the FCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this resolution will be passed and my colleagues will join me in doing all they can to make the transition from analog to digital television easier for those most affected across our Nation.</paragraph>
