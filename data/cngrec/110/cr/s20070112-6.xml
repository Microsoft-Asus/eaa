    <paragraph>Mr. President, as soon as we resume <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> in a few minutes, there will be a limited period of debate on two amendments--the Kerry amendment No. 1 relating to congressional pensions and the Vitter amendment No. 10 regarding civil penalties. These two amendments will be debated concurrently until 9:50 a.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first rollcall vote will start at 9:50. We will have two rollcall votes this morning. If Members are interested in offering amendments today, I would suggest they talk to the bill managers during these votes, or Senator McConnell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind everyone Monday is a holiday. We will have our first vote Tuesday at 5:30. It appears at this time there will be a series of votes at 5:30. So I hope we can move on down the road on this matter this morning. I am going to have some consultations with the Republican leader in a few minutes to see if we can figure out a way to end this matter as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
