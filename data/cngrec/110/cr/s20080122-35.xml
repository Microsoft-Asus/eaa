  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to discuss the current situation with regard to siting of the American Revolution Center at Valley Forge, a museum dedicated to interpreting, honoring, and celebrating the complete story of the entire American Revolution, within Valley Forge National Historical Park in Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working with the American Revolution Center for a number of years, and there has been no shortage of challenges. The current challenge is related to zoning issues in Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County. The township has approved a zoning ordinance to enable development of the American Revolution Center on a 78-acre parcel of land that is within the federally authorized boundary of Valley Forge National Historical Park but not owned by the National Park Service. The 78-acre  parcel is part of a larger 125-acre tract of land that is in danger of housing development. Not only would the American Revolution Center, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, develop a museum dedicated to the Revolutionary War, but it would also preserve the remaining 47 acres as open space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have supported appropriating Federal funding to acquire the aforementioned land that is in jeopardy of residential development. In fiscal year 2005, I helped secure $1.5 million for the National Park Service to begin acquiring 85 acres that were related to the 125-acre tract that is now connected with the American Revolution Center. In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, I supported the appropriation of $9 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the Park Service to complete the 125-acre acquisition.  However, due to increasing fiscal constraints, no funding was available at that time to continue the project. Additionally, in fiscal year 2004, I helped secure $5 million for the National Park Service to acquire other land within the Valley Forge boundary to also prevent it from housing development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the American Revolution Center taking possession of this land, it is easing the financial and obligatory burden of the Federal Government to preserve this sacred ground. Additionally, I am confident that those in charge of the administration of the American Revolution Center will be responsible stewards of the historical integrity of the land and ensure its conservation for generations to come. I am also confident that the Lower Providence Township managers, the local governing branch, will  appropriately manage the zoning ordinance for the 125-acre tract under current direction of the American Revolution Center to guarantee its conservation should the museum ever vacate the property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, recognizing the importance of Valley Forge to the founding of the United States, the creation of a museum to celebrate its history and preserve the park's integrity is a positive development. Local government decisions regarding private land use ought to be respected, and I strongly urge the Department of the Interior, the National Park Service, and the American Revolution Center to work cooperatively to expedite the creation of this museum, which is long overdue.</paragraph>
