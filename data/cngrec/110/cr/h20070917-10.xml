    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was a close call on September 1 in the town of Menasha, Wisconsin. Merlin Harn and his wife Teresa were in their car when they noticed two boys, one apparently age 5 and the other under 2, walking on some railroad tracks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Harn said it "didn't look right" to have two small children so far away from any homes, so she called 911. As she was talking to the 911 operator, she realized a train was coming. Mr. Harn immediately jumped out of the car. The older child got off the tracks, but Mr. Harn saved the life of the younger child by pulling him to safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a lot of people would have seen those two boys and would have said, "That doesn't look right, but it's none of my business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, no. The Harns acted like concerned neighbors, like responsible members of a community rather than self-obsessed individuals. And they saved a young life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their concern, and their heroic actions, deserve our recognition and thanks.</paragraph>
