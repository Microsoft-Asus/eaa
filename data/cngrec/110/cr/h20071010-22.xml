    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Saturday, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis passed into eternity after a long and courageous struggle with cancer. The gentlewoman from Virginia was elected in 2000, the same year I arrived in Washington, D.C., and we became fast friends. From the start, Jo Ann Davis stood out. Her commitment to her family, her devotion to God, and her commitment to a strong defense and traditional values were inspiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the day I met Jo Ann, she said to me very simply, "Mike, the Lord put me here. I am going to serve Him every day that I am here." Representative Jo Ann Davis kept her word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May our Savior, hers and mine, comfort her and Chuck and the boys with the words, "Well done, good and faithful servant." May this Congress always remember the service of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
