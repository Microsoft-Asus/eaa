  <narrative>INTERNET TAXATION MORATORIUM -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12208]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today on the floor of the House we addressed the question of Internet taxation moratorium, a bill that came out of my House Judiciary Committee, the Judiciary Committee which I sit on under the leadership of JOHN CONYERS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I was unavoidably detained, I wanted to congratulate the passage of this bill and to support the moratorium as relates to grandfathering in those States that already had the utilization of Internet taxation, such as my State of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that this will take a long debate on this question. We understand that there are issues on both sides. Those who are in the Internet superhighway, who want a free flowing of information and ability to buy and sell, that is a reasonable request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also know that more and more Americans will be moving toward Internet shopping and utilization, and for many local jurisdictions and States, this is a source of income that is well needed for health care and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Internet resolution that passed today, and I am grateful for the grandfathering of the State of Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
