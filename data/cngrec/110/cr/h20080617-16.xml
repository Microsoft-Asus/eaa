  <narrative>EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT AWARD -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5416]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concern about the Air Force's award of a $35 billion contract to a foreign consortium which received over $5 billion in foreign government subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of concern is the Air Force defying its own ranking system, which awarded the Boeing Corporation 98 positive discriminators and Northrop Grumman-EADS only 30, yet the tanker contract went to EADS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Boeing's 767 tanker had a positive survivability rating. EADS' aircraft had a negative rating. Yet the tanker contract went to EADS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Boeing has manufactured over 2,000 tankers with advanced fly-by-wire booms; EADS, zero. Yet the tanker contract went to EADS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lifecycle cost of the EADS tanker is going to be billions and billions more than that of the Boeing aircraft, yet the tanker contract went to EADS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We continue to face record fuel prices, and it is critical that the Air Force's next refueling tanker meet or exceed their requirements and be as efficient as possible. An independent study has determined that the Boeing KC-767 fleet burns 24 percent less fuel than the EADS A-330s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the sake of the American workers, the American economy and our national security, it is time to revisit this contract.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
