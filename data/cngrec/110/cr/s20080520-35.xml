  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, economic anxiety is pervasive among the middle class in my State of Ohio and throughout our great country, and there is good reason for that. The average duration of unemployment--17.5 weeks--is longer than at the start of the two previous recessions. In 2001, it took the average unemployed worker about 12.5 weeks to find work. In 1990, it took the average unemployed worker almost 12 weeks to find work. The average duration of unemployment now is about 17.5 weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, long-term unemployment is higher now than it has been at any other time since Congress first extended unemployment benefits, since 1980. The share of workers suffering long-term unemployment, meaning those who remain jobless after their first 6 months of benefits run out--so if their benefits run out after 6 months, that defines long-term unemployment by the Government--the share of those workers is nearly 17 percent higher than the 11 percent at the start of the 2001 recession and higher  than the 9.8 percent at the start of the 1990 recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State of Ohio has not added jobs since the end of the last recession, even while economists and an indecisive President wonder whether the country is entering another one, with all of their definitions and all of their pondering these questions and all of the indifference that comes out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. What I do know is that there are 58,000 fewer jobs in Ohio than there were in November 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past year around my State, I have attended almost 100 roundtables where I have convened meetings of 120, 125 people who sit around a table and talk to me about their hopes and dreams, what is happening in their communities, ways I can help, and all of the things that can help me do my job in the Senate. One of the topics that came up again and again during these meetings was the topic of economic insecurity. Wages are stagnant, jobs are scarce, and jobs are too often temporary. Sometimes,  laid-off workers have seen their lives change. Instead of one good-paying job, they are holding two part-time or full-time jobs that pay significantly less than the job they held earlier. Middle-class families are struggling now and deeply worried about the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing today on plant closings and workers' rights. This summer marks 20 years since Congress passed major plant closing legislation known as the WARN Act, a bill championed by Senator Howard Metzenbaum from Ohio, who  held this seat, and Senator Kennedy, who is our committee chair today on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the witnesses today was a gentleman from Senator Kennedy's State of Massachusetts, Joe Aguiar, who worked for a fabric manufacturer for nearly 30 years. He and 900 coworkers were laid off without any notice last summer. As are so many workers in manufacturing, he is about 50 years old. Like so many other workers in my State of Ohio, in Springfield and Lima and Tiffin and Marietta, their lives have been upended. For most, the pensions and health care which they earned and which  they desperately need and which they thought had been promised to them, so often the pensions and health care will be slashed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Aguiar, as workers do in places such as Marion, OH, and Xenia and Zanesville--those workers need an extension of unemployment insurance. Now more than ever, we need to extend those unemployment benefits because so many workers see their unemployment benefits run out because they can't find comparable jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very simple. Economists on Wall Street and Washington and universities all say that every dollar invested in unemployment benefits leads to $1.64 in growth--more than any other stimulus package, any other stimulus program, any other way to put money into the economy. We had this discussion, and the unemployment extension was blocked by congressional Republicans some months ago. In addition, we offered a stimulus package which will, in fact, put money in people's pockets--a good thing. Unemployment  extension would have come quicker and put money into the pockets of those who will spend it immediately because they are struggling. They need the money for gas for their cars to go out and look for jobs, for food to feed their families, and the daily necessities of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office agrees that a dollar in unemployment benefits leads to $1.64 in growth, finding that extending unemployment benefits is cost-effective and the single fastest acting measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and the Akron Beacon Journal in my State all agree. Last week, the House approved an extension of unemployment insurance. The Democrats are trying to--or are going to--include unemployment insurance extension in the stimulus package. We hope the Republicans don't filibuster this, and that the President finally changes his mind and signs an extension of unemployment insurance. It is a reasonable extension and needs to be done now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I came over here today to talk about unemployment benefits and extending them, my thoughts turned to Senator Kennedy and his family. Senator Kennedy, who we find out today has been diagnosed with a serious illness, has been fighting for an extension of unemployment insurance certainly lately in this case, and other times, but he is always fighting for workers, the poor, and the middle class. Nobody in this Congress has consistently, or for a longer period of time, in the  history of this institution, fought for workers or the middle class the way Senator Kennedy has, and the way he will continue to; he has been tireless about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, I stood on the Senate floor with Senator Kennedy as we worked together to pass legislation that came out of his committee, a committee on which I also sit, the Health, Education, Labor, Pension Committee, to establish collective bargaining rights for firefighters and others. When it comes to issues facing working families, Senator Kennedy, as recently as last week, fought for legislation to give workers a civil right--the right to collective bargaining. He has  been the compass of this institution too. He focuses his attention and our attention on the insecurities so many families in this country are facing. Our prayers today are with him as he heals, and with his lovely family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
