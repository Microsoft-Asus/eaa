    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend from American Samoa coming in here. I am not casting any aspersions on him or his wonderful territory. I didn't throw allegations or aspersions on anyone. But there is a cloud of corruption hovering over this body that effects every one of us, and it would be so easy to get the air cleared. But there is really one person that could clear the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For so long people in this country cynically say: It is not what you know, it is who you know. Many of us say: That is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe if the Speaker would come forward, rise to a question of personal privilege, Madam Speaker, we could get this thing resolved and get it behind us so it is no longer an issue, and figure out how in the world a group, a territory got exempted that actually benefits a company in the Speaker's own district. And then we will be beyond it and move on in a bipartisan way, which I hope we will eventually have the opportunity to do.</paragraph>
