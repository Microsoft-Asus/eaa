    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's kind of funny to listen to the other side talk today. You would think that they had been really working on the energy crisis in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President took over, gasoline was about $1.80 a gallon, and now it's $3.80 a gallon where I live. Now, that's an energy policy you could see developed in the White House by Mr. Cheney. He brought in all the oil company executives and said, how can we drive up the price of gasoline so you guys can make a whole lot of money? They had a secret meeting. They wouldn't tell anybody who was there. They wouldn't tell anybody what was talked about. They have been fighting in the courts  for 8 years to keep from telling us what went on at that meeting at the beginning of the Bush administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see the results. They got them, the biggest profits of the oil companies in history. And we tried to take a little $16 billion loophole and close it and use some of that money for alternative energy production and conservation and the President said, no way, we can't take anything away from those oil companies. Why, they need it all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're not going to get a reduction in oil prices in this country until we change the administration when BARACK OBAMA takes over on the 20th of January, 2009.</paragraph>
