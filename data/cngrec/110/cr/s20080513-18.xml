  <narrative>NATIONAL POLICE WEEK -- (Senate - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4097">S4097</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 10 Louisiana law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty this past year, and they are being recognized in Washington this week as part of National Police Week. I welcome their families and colleagues to the Nation's Capital. These officers lost their lives while serving their communities and are being honored for their courage and the ultimate sacrifice they made to serve and protect the citizens of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Police Week is collaborative effort to honor the service and sacrifice of America's law enforcement community and includes the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, NLEOMF, the Fraternal Order of Police/Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary, FOP/FOA, and the Concerns of Police Survivors, COPS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officers from around the country and the families of fallen officers travel to Washington, DC, for events including the Peace Officers Memorial Day Service at the U.S. Capitol and the National Police Survivor's Conference. In addition, the names of our 10 Louisiana heroes will be engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial along with 348 other names from around the country. The names will also be read at a candlelight vigil at the memorial this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The following brave police officers and Sheriff's deputies gave their lives  to protect our Louisiana communities: Patrolman Brian Keith Coleman, Alexandria Police Department; Detective Thelonious Anthony Dukes, Sr., New Orleans Police Department; Sergeant R. Alan Inzer, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office; Deputy Hilery Alexander Mayo, Jr., St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office; Deputy Joshua E. Norris, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office; Sergeant Linden  Albert Raimer, St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office; Chief David Gerald Richard, Port Barre Police Department; Sergeant John Russell Smith, Bastrop Police Department; Detective Charles Douglas Wilson, Jr., Bastrop Police Department; and Deputy Yvonne D. Pettit, Washington Parish Sheriff's Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sacrifices of our heroic law enforcement officers remind us that it is Congress's responsibility to ensure the Federal Government looks after our disabled officers and firefighters, as well as the families of our fallen and disabled first responders. They put themselves in harm's way each day so that the rest of us may live safely and peacefully in a free society. There is no group more deserving of our full support, and the truth is, our Federal Government has not done enough to care for  and honor these officers, their families, and their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Police Week provides an opportunity for us to reflect on our law enforcement officers' contributions to building safe and productive communities in Louisiana and across the country. I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 10 Louisiana fallen officers, their families, and their colleagues across the country for their unwavering service and dedication to keeping us safe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to commemorate the hard work and sacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers all across our great land. Many officers have lost their lives in the line of duty so that our families and communities may remain safe. We must never forget those who have given their lives to protect us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962 President John F. Kennedy first declared the annual celebration of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week in "recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our laws."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, many men and women have paid the ultimate price for our security, including many brave New Mexicans. This year, two New Mexico police officers will be honored and remembered by having their names added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first, Patrolman Germaine F. Casey of Albuquerque, was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident while he was a part of the police escort for President George W. Bush's trip to Albuquerque, NM, on August 27, 2007. Patrolman Casey was an officer with the Rio Rancho Police Department and had previously served as an officer with the University of New Mexico Police for 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also being honored this week is Officer Christopher M. Mirabal of Alamogordo, who passed away as a result of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident while on duty as a New Mexico State police officer on July 13, 2007. Officer Mirabal was a lifelong resident of Alamogordo and like Patrolman Casey, worked to protect New Mexicans, including the families they left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we remember the dedication of Patrolman Casey and Officer Mirabal and all of our fallen police men and women who protect and serve our communities, and the tragic price they paid for that devotion. We must also remember the families of all fallen officers and the sacrifices they have incurred because of a deep-seated commitment to duty and public service. All of us from New Mexico owe a debt of gratitude to each and every officer who has lost their life in the line of duty. To those  who continue to serve, we are grateful. You have my utmost admiration.</paragraph>
