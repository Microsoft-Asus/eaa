  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="2429">H.R. 2429</bill>) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide an exception to the 60-day limit on Medicare reciprocal billing arrangements between two physicians during the period in which one of the physicians is ordered to active duty as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the bill.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I thank my good friend from California (Mr. Thompson) for sponsoring it. This legislation is necessary to ensure that our Nation's doctors, who are brave enough to serve their country in a time of war, have a medical practice to serve in when they come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, Medicare allows for a physician who is ordered to active duty as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces to enter into a 60-day billing arrangement with another physician. These arrangements allow for physicians to maintain their practices while they go off to take care of our soldiers in combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, what we are finding is that they are often away longer than 60 days, which puts them at odds with the current Medicare antifraud rules. This legislation fixes that problem by lifting the 60-day limit currently in place, and allowing a physician who is called to active duty to find a substitute physician to watch over his patients for as long as he or she is deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. BARTON of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill on substance and in adamant opposition of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the substance of this bill. It has two distinguished cosponsors, one in the majority party, one in the minority party. The underlying substance is eminently fair, and we are not going to ask for a rollcall vote. If it passes on a voice vote, so be it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having said that, I want to say in the strongest possible terms how extremely disappointed, and I mean extremely disappointed, that we have a bill that is in two committees of jurisdiction, the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the bill had not even been introduced, had not even been introduced until this morning. There was no bill number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when you put a bill on the Suspension Calendar, theoretically the majority party, the chairman or chairmen or chairwomen ask the ranking member of the minority party if there is any problem with the bill. If there is not, then they approve it. Then the Speaker of the House or the majority leader of the House calls the minority leader of the House and says, "We want to put this bill on the Suspension Calendar." And you do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have a bill before us that was not even introduced until the House convened this morning. There has been no hearing, there is no record, there has been no phone call. Chairman Dingell did not call me yesterday, he did not call me this morning. I don't know if Chairman Rangel called Ranking Member McCrery. I do know that Nancy Pelosi or Steny Hoyer did not call John Boehner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are now in a situation, we have a little extra time, let's introduce a bill and pass it in the next 30 minutes. We did not do that when we were in the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this is a good bill. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Johnson deserve accolades for seeing a flaw in the current Social Security law, the Medicare law, and rectifying it. That is not the issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new majority campaigned on a platform of fairness and openness. Is this fair? Is this open?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This happens to be a good bill. What if it weren't? What if it weren't?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only two Members that really know anything about it are the two cosponsors, and thankfully they are both decent, honorable men, and we have read the substance of the bill and it is okay. But this is not the way the House of Representatives should be run. It is just wrong, W-R-O-N-G, wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I support the substance of the bill, but I am adamantly opposed to the process. I hope this thing goes on a voice vote. If it is a rollcall vote, I am going to vote "present" and express, when I see Mr. Dingell, in the strongest possible terms how upset I am about the process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me just correct one thing. The staff tells me Mr. Rangel did call our committee yesterday at 10 o'clock in the morning on this bill. So the Ways and Means Committee was informed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Did he call Mr. McCrery?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Then I stand corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just in response, I understand where Mr. Barton is coming from. But I just want to point out that we do have bipartisan support in the House on the bill. And it is only a temporary measure that lasts for 1 year and provides immediate relief to these physicians that are going overseas and fighting for the country. It is a very special circumstance, which I don't think provides any real precedent here, because we do have these physicians who are going to serve their country in Iraq and  we just don't want them to have a situation where they come back and they don't have any medical practice. I just don't think that is fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would mention to the ranking member that if we wanted to make a permanent change in this, we would be sure to spend more time and work with our Republican colleagues in accomplishing that goal. This is a temporary measure, and it is just because of the circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson) such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400403" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members, this is a very important bill. There are almost 3,000 physicians that are serving our country in the Reserves and the National Guard. And, as has been pointed out, when these folks are deployed and they leave, just like every other person in the Guard and Reserves that is deployed, they leave their families, they leave their businesses at home, and they go over and they serve their country. But there is just one thing different with these doctors; when they are deployed,  they also leave behind their patients. And these are patients who depend upon the medical care they get from that great American who is now serving his or her country, and these patients can't go without a doctor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way the rules are now, the physician has to line up someone to take their patients in their absence, and they can only do this for 60 days. This doesn't work. It is bad for the doctors and it is bad for the patients. What we are trying to do is to waive that 60-day requirement so the physicians can line up one doctor to take their Medicare patients while they are serving our country in Afghanistan or in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And it's a temporary measure. It's only good through this year. So we can, in fact, establish a permanent fix. And this bill has been vetted all through the different committees, and the Ways and Means Committee, both the chairman and the ranking member are very aware of this bill. And my good friend and committee colleague and war hero Sam Johnson has signed up on this as a coauthor, recognizing the plight of both the physicians who are serving, and their patients and their practices  at home. And it's important that we fix this now and then continue to work on the permanent fix so we can make sure that no doctors and no patients who are caught in this vise go without medical care, or doctors, while serving their country, lose their practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I just want to say a special thank you to Dr. Bradley Clair of Lakeport, California, my constituent, who brought this to my attention. And  he's ready to be deployed on his third tour. He'll be going to Iraq. So we need to fix it for him, for the other doctors, and patients who are exposed because of this problem. We need to fix it permanently. And this is the first step in doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sam, thank you for your help and your friendship on this and other important issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the minority sponsor of this piece of legislation, the Honorable Sam Johnson of Plano, Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, it's not every day the House gets to consider a bipartisan, commonsense bill that's affordable. This doesn't cost anything and supports our service men and women overseas. However, I'm happy to say this is one of those days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now the law prevents a Medicare physician from leaving his practice for more than 60 days at a time. And the regulation was created to prevent fraud, but it had the unintended effect of making life more difficult for someone that's called up to serve his country. And this bill eliminates the red tape by allowing our reservists to have one substitute doctor for their entire deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only will the bill help our reservists, it'll prevent Medicare beneficiaries from experiencing a gap in service or losing access to care altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank my colleague from California for bringing this problem to my attention, I'm surprised we hadn't had it brought to our attention before, and for all the work you and your staff have done to get the bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who serve our country and their communities need and want our assistance, and it's time we helped our weekend warriors who happen to be doctors to keep their patients and keep their practice. This is a great bill, and I appreciate the time. I thank Mr. Kucinich for providing us the opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I was going to inquire whether my colleague on the other side does.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>No, Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume briefly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We support the underlying concept of the bill, and, as I said, if it passes on a voice vote, we won't ask for a roll call vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do stand by what I said, though, in terms of the committee process. We've got two bills on the suspension calendar from the Energy and Commerce Committee. Neither bill had a legislative hearing. Neither bill had a markup at subcommittee or full committee. Neither bill was introduced in its current form as of 2:45 yesterday afternoon. Both bills are on the floor today on the suspension calendar. That does call into question whether we even need an Energy and Commerce Committee, given that everything  apparently comes to the floor without going through the committee process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we support the underlying principles of this bill, and we certainly support the patriotism and courage of the two sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would just say again, this is a temporary measure. We have these brave men and women who are leaving to care for our troops in Iraq, we're in a time of war, and I think it's just a very special circumstance right now. So I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
