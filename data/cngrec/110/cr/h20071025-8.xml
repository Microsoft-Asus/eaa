  <narrative>PUTTING SUPERBUGS ON THE DEFENSIVE -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12023]</narrative>

    <paragraph>This Tuesday, a Wall Street Journal article written by Theo Francis started off by saying, "Hospitals are prime breeding grounds for antibiotic-resistant `superbugs' that kill tens of thousands of Americans each year. But most people have had no way of knowing how well their hospital keeps these bacteria--and infections in general--under control."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nineteen States have some version of requiring reporting of infection rates in hospitals, but there is no overall plan for this, and thus there is a great  deal of confusion. That is why I introduced <bill type="h" number="1174">H.R. 1174</bill>, the Healthy Hospitals Act, to help our Nation's citizens understand the infection rates in hospitals and get these under control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are today's sad statistics. So far this year 1.6 million people have developed an infection in a hospital. There have been 73,000 deaths and a cost of over $40 billion. It is time we get these under control, and I ask my colleagues to help support by signing on as cosponsors of <bill type="h" number="1174">H.R. 1174</bill>. Let's stop these deadly diseases that are killing so many in our hospitals.</paragraph>
