  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize several outstanding students from the Roberts Wesleyan College, which is located in my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's world, if we needed an innovative cutting-edge solution to a challenge, we look to our institutions of higher education. Each year, the Motion Picture Association of America partners with Students in Free Enterprise to host a national competition to produce a public service announcement regarding the importance of intellectual property rights. For the second year in a row, Roberts Wesleyan College placed among the top 3 of over 40 competitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These talented Roberts Wesleyan students won a cash award, and their broadcast now has a chance to achieve national exposure. Their outstanding accomplishment will have an impact on both the local and the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the efforts of these students.</paragraph>
