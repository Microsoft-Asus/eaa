    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the centennial of the town of Ronda, North Carolina. This week, Ronda celebrates the 100th anniversary of its 1907 incorporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ronda, a thriving community in Wilkes County, North Carolina, is home to a rich heritage of hardworking families, and I am very proud to represent them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The town traces its roots all the way back to 1779, when the surrounding area was deeded to Benjamin Cleveland in what would become the eastern part of Wilkes County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cleveland established a farming operation which became known as Roundabout Farm, named for the way the Yadkin River cut through the land around the farm. As these things usually turn out, the term Roundabout was shortened and the name Ronda was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Manufacturing operations and agriculture have played a large role in the town's 100-year history, making Ronda one of the economic epicenters of Wilkes County during the past century. While the town of Ronda has certainly seen its share of economic storms, it remains a strong and united American community today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to honor this fine North Carolina community for its steadfast commitment to the small town values that help make this Nation great. Happy centennial, Ronda. Here's to 100 more years of small town living.</paragraph>
