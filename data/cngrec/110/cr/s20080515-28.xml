  <narrative>CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOLY NAME OF JESUS PARISH -- (Senate - May 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4280">S4280</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to congratulate Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church and School in Beech Grove, IN, currently celebrating the centennial year of the founding of the parish. On the weekend of June 27-29, 2008, the clergy, students, and parishioners who are part of the Holy Name community will honor this signal event. I am confident it will be a time of joy, worship, and fellowship that members will cherish well into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Holy Name was founded in 1908 by the Rt. Rev. Silas Chatard, the first Bishop of Indianapolis. In its inaugural decade the parish grew steadily, and the years that followed brought about exciting changes and expansions to the facilities and ministries provided by the church. In the early 1920s, the Holy Name School was built; its first class graduated in 1923; and to date, the school has graduated over 4,200 students from prekindergarten to eighth grade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Holy Name and its many members for the laudable service they provide local communities in the greater Indianapolis area and beyond, and I am hopeful that these festivities will be an opportunity for celebrants to not only honor the past achievements of their parish, but the blessings of another 100 years as well.</paragraph>
