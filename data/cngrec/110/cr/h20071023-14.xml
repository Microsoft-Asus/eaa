    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, SCHIP continues to be used as a political game by Washington liberals. Sensible, effective compromise does exist to bring meaningful bipartisan support for this necessary program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kids First bill, of which I am a cosponsor, adds 1.3 million new children to the SCHIP program by 2012. It encourages the States to move children to private coverage. Kids First provides $14 billion in new SCHIP allotments, and it includes $400 million in grants for outreach and enrollment. This is a sensible approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support SCHIP, and I am committed to ensuring that it is a successful program that helps children who need it and the children for whom it was really intended, those who are in poverty. It makes SCHIP a program for those whom it was intended for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues, Representatives Camp and Hulshof, for their work on this bill. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in this compromise approach to help put our poor children first.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
