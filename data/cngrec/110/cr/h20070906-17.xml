  <narrative>CHILDREN DESERVE HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10163]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is getting harder for American families to make ends meet, especially when it comes to the rising cost of health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New census data shows that the number of Americans without health insurance nationwide rose by nearly 2 million in 2006. In addition, the number of children without health insurance grew by 700,000 to nearly 8.7 million children. These new numbers mean that one in nine American kids don't have health insurance, including 22 percent of Hispanic children and 14 percent of African American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These numbers are appalling for a Nation as wealthy as ours. That is why the Democratic Congress passed the CHAMP Act; to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 million children and to provide 5 million more children with health insurance, covering a total of 11 million children. But President Bush has threatened to veto this critical bill, despite strong bipartisan support among Congress and Governors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these new census numbers can't be ignored. It is time to stop playing politics with children's health insurance. It is time for the President to support and sign the CHAMP Act.</paragraph>
