    <paragraph>How quickly we forget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Mental Health Schools Act of 2007, which proposes to expand access to school-based mental health services. It would provide grants to local school districts or coalitions of schools, health providers and communities. It would identify students in need of immediate mental health care on site, require schools to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate training for students, parents and members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statistics we have learned in the last few years are alarming, and they tell an alarming truth. Childhood mental illnesses affect nearly one in five adolescents. One in three Latina adolescents contemplate suicide. The time for action was a long time ago, and we need to move forward on this. The need for mental health services has never been greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enacting this legislation will be a great benefit to our society. It would allow mental health professionals to care for our kids in need of immediate health and allow our teachers to concentrate on teaching.</paragraph>
