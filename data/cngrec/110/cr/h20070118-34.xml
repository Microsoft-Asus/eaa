  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN  Energy Act of 2007. This bill will help move our country toward a goal shared by all Americans, a desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by shifting our energy emphasis from the Middle East to the Midwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the GAO, the United States has spent $130 billion in the past 32 years in government subsidies to the oil industry. The CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 represents a bold new direction in our energy policy by creating a strategic renewable energy reserve to invest in clean renewable energy resources like ethanol, biodiesel and wind energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone whose family has been farming in Iowa for the past 150 years, I am proud that Iowa has been at the epicenter of the renewable fuels explosion and alternative energy boom with over 55 ethanol and biodiesel refineries built or under construction. Iowa also ranks third in wind energy production and tenth in wind energy potential in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to have had the privilege to have voted today for the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
