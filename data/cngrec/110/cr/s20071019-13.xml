  <narrative>AGENDA -- (Senate - October 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13146">S13146</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have indicated, Madam President, we have a lot of work to do. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I have stated on a number of occasions that on controversial judicial nominations we are not going to move on those until the minority tells us that is what they want to do. One of those nominations is Judge Southwick. That matter was reported out of committee sometime ago, and both Senator Leahy and I have said that when the Republicans tell us they want to move to that  nomination, we would do that. So sometime next week I am more than likely going to move to that matter. So I want everyone to know that, in fact, is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also, Madam President, have indicated that one of our priorities is to do an energy bill this year. I had a meeting yesterday with Democratic chairs and other interested people, including Senator Cantwell and Senator Dorgan, to find out how we can move forward. We realize we can move forward. We have a number of issues that are important. The issues are somewhat limited. One is what are we going to do on CAFE, raising the fuel efficiency of vehicles? What are we going to do  about a renewable portfolio standard? And what are we going to do about the tax aspect of this that will do a number of important things, not the least of which is give the great entrepreneurs  in our country the incentives to invest in alternative fuel--sun, wind, geothermal, biomass? We need this to be done on a multiple-year basis. So those are three important things we need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had a number of conversations with my Republican colleagues. Senator Domenici and Senator Lott--there are others with whom I have spoken--but just in recent days I have spoken to them. I spoke this morning with Leader Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. She wants to go to conference on this issue. One Republican Senator said: I understand you don't want to go to conference. The Speaker wants to go to conference. I want to go to conference. We would like to be able  to do a bill, and we are going to do our very best to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to include the Republicans on anything we do. We know we cannot do a bill unless we include the Republicans in it, and we are going to do that. We are going to do our utmost to come up with a strong bill, one that is in keeping with the needs of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, everyone is occupied on that side of the aisle, but I am going to, in the near future, when we have a Republican who can come to the floor, ask consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 340, which is <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, which is the House Energy bill. And I will move that we go to conference on it. I will come out this afternoon, as soon as we can, and offer this unanimous consent request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
