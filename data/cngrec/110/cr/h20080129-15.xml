  <narrative>DEMOCRATS REFORM EARMARK PROCESS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H483]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 7 years into his Presidency, President Bush is finally urging reform of the earmark process. He is a little late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressional Democrats have already begun reforming the earmark process. We realized reform was necessary after the number of earmarks in appropriations bills skyrocketed under the Republicans. You didn't hear the President complaining then. In fact, he signed every appropriations bill that came to his desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats, in stark contrast, have led the way in bringing transparency and accountability to the earmark process. We instituted a 1-year moratorium on earmarks in 2007 until a reformed process could be put into place. We also adopted rules that provided for unprecedented transparency in earmarks and then significantly reduced the number of earmarks last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are pleased to hear that the President is interested in reforming the earmark process. The Bush White House requests and receives funding for hundreds of earmarks each year, and we look forward to working with the President to both limit and bring increased transparency to the Presidential and congressional earmarks.</paragraph>
