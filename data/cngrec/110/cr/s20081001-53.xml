  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United States, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores are among the highest in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the Council Bluffs Community School District, and to report on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among educators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="10312">S10312</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Council Bluffs Community School District received Harkin grants totaling $2,914,250 which it used to help modernize and make safety improvements throughout the district. The district received a 1999 construction grant for $750,000 to help replace windows and update HVAC systems at Longfellow, Lewis and Clark and Pusey Elementary Schools, a 2002 grant for $1 million to help upgrade plumbing at Thomas Jefferson High School and Edison, Roosevelt and Washington Schools and a 2003 grant for $500,000  to help upgrade the HVAC and electrical systems, at Washington School and to help build a preschool restroom at Rue Elementary School. The district also received three fire safety grants totaling $675,000 to install sprinkler systems, fire alarm systems and make other safety improvements at several schools in the district. The Federal grants have made it possible for the district to provide quality and safe schools for their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. They are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned citizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in the Council Bluffs Community School District. In particular, I would like to recognize the leadership of the board of education--President Marvin Arnpriester, Vice President Mark McGee, David Coziahr, J.J. Harvey, Janine Headen,  Glen Mitchell, and Gina Malloy Primmer, and former board members Billi Harrill, Melanie Bates, Bobbette Behrens, Louie Carta, Francis Clark, Pam Collins, Randy Ewing, Marilyn Heider, Rick Killion, Kenneth Petersen, Mark Peterson, Cathy Ryba, Rita Sealock, David</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in Iowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings and facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, some 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming sports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown or antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our young people about our priorities. We have to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in the Council Bluffs Community School District. There is no question that a quality public education for every child is a top priority in that community. I salute them and wish them a very successful new school year.</paragraph>
