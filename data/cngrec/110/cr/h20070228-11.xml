  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will consider the unfortunately named Employee Free Choice Act. Contrary to the title's implication, this bill will repeal employees' rights to hold secret ballot elections when deciding whether to form a union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The so-called card check provision of the bill would force union membership by the signing of a form and thus denying employees having secret ballot elections. As citizens of a democratic Nation, Americans have the right to elect their public officials in secrecy and without coercion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans will fight to uphold a worker's rights by offering an alternative to this misguided legislation. This alternative, championed by the late Congressman Charlie Norwood, guarantees workers the right of a secret ballot election and prohibits anyone from coercively subjecting employees to a card check campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
