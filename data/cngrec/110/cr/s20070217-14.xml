    <paragraph>Mr. President, Vermont is constantly made a better place by some of the extraordinary people who come there and add to the talents of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such person is Claudia Becker. She has restored the Big Picture Theater in Waitsfield along with her husband Eugene Jarecki. The theater has become a center for the people of the Mad River Valley, and Claudia has shown a sense of conscience in films she has shown at Big Picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Claudia for years and her husband Eugene for years before that. Marcelle, as an acting justice of the peace, even performed their marriage. We have enjoyed watching their home grow in Vermont, as well as the addition of two of the most beautiful children anyone could wish for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, Seven Days in Vermont wrote an article about Claudia and what she has done with her film festival. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
