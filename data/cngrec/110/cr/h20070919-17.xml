  <narrative>COLLEGE COST REDUCTION &amp; ACCESS ACT: DEMOCRATS ACT ON MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10515]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, according to the U.S. Department of Education, an estimated 200,000 academically qualified students are not able to go to college every year because they can't afford the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a dangerous trend for our Nation, but it is not surprising. Under the Bush administration, prices at public colleges have increased by 40 percent after inflation. And under Republican rule, Pell Grants remained stagnant for 4 years in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our Democratic majority was elected, we pledged to address this growing crisis, and this week are fulfilling that pledge by sending the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to the President's desk. This important legislation provides the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill, increases the maximum Pell Grant over the next 5 years, and cuts interest rates in half on need-based student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help millions of students across our Nation afford a college education without saddling themselves with thousands of dollars in debt, and it is the latest example of what the Democratic Congress is doing.</paragraph>
