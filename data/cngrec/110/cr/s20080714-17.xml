  <narrative>CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS -- (Senate - July 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6620">S6620</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have talked to the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and explained to him where we are. I am very happy we have an agreement to move forward on PEPFAR. That agreement is that we have 10 amendments. They are amendments we worked on hard. We did it all day Thursday and Thursday night, and then Friday, of course, perfecting the agreement, and we now have consent to move to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the problem that faces the majority: By our moving to PEPFAR, it opens a spot where somebody can move to proceed to something else, anything that is on the calendar. Anyone can come in and move to that piece of legislation, and file a cloture motion with it, which would force us to be on that matter. I cannot allow that to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this with the deepest respect for all my Republican colleagues, but we have had a little bit of mischievous legislation being thrown about here, and so if I move to something else to fill that spot to keep someone else from moving to something else, we on this side would be very happy to leave that dormant, do nothing with it, and move forward and complete PEPFAR. There would be no harm to anyone in doing this. But it would seem to me there would be a lot of harm if--I will not mention  any names--the two or three likely suspects walked over here and moved to proceed to something else. I think it would create a lot of problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This PEPFAR legislation dealing with global AIDS is extremely important. The President wants it. I do not know of a single Democrat who does not want it. I think most Republicans--I think the vast majority of Republicans--want this. So I would hope we are not going to get off track because of some folks over here who have tended to make me kind of look for a sucker punch to be thrown at any time. I think we would all be ill-advised to not finish PEPFAR at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would ask that morning business be closed. That being  the case, I think the order is now in effect that once it is closed, we would be on PEPFAR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that right; I ask the Chair?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
