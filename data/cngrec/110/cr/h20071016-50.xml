    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on <bill type="hr" number="549">H. Res. 549</bill>.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. House Resolution 549, introduced by Congressman GUS BILIRAKIS, recognizes the contributions made to our Nation's security by the Coast Guard's Waterway Watch program. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I strongly support the Waterway Watch program, and I support the resolution offered by the gentleman from Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Put simply, America's Waterway Watch program enlists the 70 million Americans who work, play or live around our Nation's waterfronts, rivers, lakes, and coastal regions to become part of our Nation's first line of defense by observing and reporting suspicious activities. Founded by the Coast Guard in 2004, the Waterway Watch is similar to earlier Coast Watch programs instituted during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time, the Coast Watch program was comprised of a group of volunteers who scanned our coasts for U-boats threatening U.S. shipping. Today, America's Waterway Watch calls on volunteers to aid in the war on terrorism on our home front. People are advised to take note of suspicious activities and, if it can be done safely, they are encouraged to take photographs or videotape of the occurrence. Observers are then asked to immediately report incidents they have witnessed by calling 911 or the  America's Waterway Watch 24-hour national toll-free telephone number, 1-877-24-WATCH. Reported information is then sent to the National Response Center located at Coast Guard headquarters to be evaluated and dispersed to local Coast Guard responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I emphasize that this watch program is meant to be a simple deterrent to potential terrorist activity by asking  those who frequent our waterways, ports, and waterfront areas to report events and people that seem out of place. It is not a surveillance program and is not meant to spread paranoia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, I also commend the Coast Guard Auxiliary, which is at the forefront of the Waterway Watch program. The auxiliary is the uniformed civilian component of the Coast Guard. It is primarily responsible for implementing programs that serve the recreational boating community. In fact, the auxiliary helps to promote America's Waterway Watch through their well-established recreational boating safety programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend the Nationwide Insurance Company, which has supported the Waterway Watch program by giving the Coast Guard Auxiliary Association a $96,000 grant to support the auxiliary's role in the Coast Guard's maritime homeland security missions. The grant funded the purchase of Waterway Watch stickers that boaters can display on their boats. It also funded the printing of brochures, wallet cards, and posters that provide pertinent information on the watch program, including detailing how  citizens can become involved in the program and listing the numbers that can be called to report suspicious activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard's active duty, Reserve and auxiliary forces have united with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and local law enforcement agencies to detect and deter threatening activities at waterfront facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there are some 95,000 miles of shoreline, 300,000 square miles of waterways, 6,000 bridges, 360 ports of call, and 12,000 marinas in the United States; and the Coast Guard and other first responders simply cannot watch all of these facilities all the time. America's Waterway Watch program ensures that ordinary citizens can help our Nation's uniformed agencies protect our homeland simply by remaining vigilant in their own communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again express my support for America's Waterway Watch program, which helps keep citizens involved in watching our Nation's shores and waterways, and recognizes the importance of the service they are providing. I urge my colleagues to adopt <bill type="hr" number="549">H. Res. 549</bill> and again commend Congressman Bilirakis for his work on this measure. I also congratulate and thank my colleague, the ranking member of our Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee (Mr. LaTourette),  for his cooperation in this bipartisan effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Cummings from Maryland, for bringing this important measure to the floor in such a bipartisan way. I enjoy continuing to work with the chairman on a variety of matters that affect the Coast Guard and our Nation's maritime industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 549, which recognizes the importance of America's Waterway Watch program in enhancing our Nation's maritime security. America's Waterway Watch was established by the Coast Guard to encourage America's 70 million recreational boaters to report suspicious activity in the maritime environment to local law enforcement agencies. The program is a nationwide initiative that is similar to the Neighborhood Watch program that is so effective in many of  our neighborhoods back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through America's Waterway Watch program, the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Reserve, and the Coast Guard Auxiliary are actively educating the public on actions and behavior that constitute suspicious activities. These outreach efforts are being made in cooperation with our Nation's recreational boaters, marine dealers, marinas, and other businesses located near waterways. America's Waterway Watch program acts as an important force multiplier for Coast Guard and local law enforcement and enhances  the capabilities of local and regional security programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the resolution's sponsor, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), and all of the other cosponsors for rightly recognizing this important community program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all of the Members of the House to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At this time, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the author of the resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 549, a resolution that I have introduced to recognize the importance of increased maritime domain awareness and support the goals of America's Waterway Watch program. It has become clear in the years since 9/11 that all Americans have a shared responsibility for our country's security. That is why I am pleased to highlight the importance of a program that encourages citizens to do their part to strengthen our homeland defenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has begun to focus greater attention on potential security threats from individuals aboard small vessels and the importance of increasing maritime domain awareness. Many of us who represent coastal States already know and understand how vitally important it is to take reasonable and appropriate security precautions to secure our maritime borders from such threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard currently conducts a maritime homeland security public awareness program called America's Waterway Watch. This program, which is the maritime equivalent of a Neighborhood Watch program, encourages boaters and others who live, work or engage in recreational activities around America's waterways to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and report suspicious and unusual activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This voluntary public outreach program educates America's 70 million boaters about the types of suspicious activities they should be looking for and encourages them to report any such abnormalities to the Coast Guard's National Response Center, which is manned 24 hours a day at 877-24-WATCH. Calls to the center are immediately evaluated and, if necessary, acted upon by local Coast Guard sector assets and other law enforcement authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program, which the Coast Guard promotes by distributing educational materials and other information to recreational boaters, marine dealers, marinas and other businesses located near waterways, acts as a force multiplier for the Coast Guard and local law enforcement to help increase maritime domain awareness and strengthen maritime security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that we need to improve waterway security and bolster our maritime defenses. However, it is critically important that we do so in a reasonable and responsible manner with the input and advice of America's recreational boaters and manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security conducted a National Small Vessel Security Summit in June to educate small vessel operators and other stakeholders on current security risks and initiate a dialogue about possible solutions to close whatever gaps exist in our maritime security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Summit participants highlighted America's Waterway Watch and its contributions to increasing maritime domain awareness and urge greater support for it. I agree that America's Waterway Watch program is a sensible and reasonable step toward bolstering our maritime defenses without imposing costly and confusing new regulations on recreational boaters who play an important economic role in my district. I look forward to a continuing and productive dialogue between them and Federal Homeland Security  officials before any rules or mandates are proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I finish, I want to thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR and Chairman Cummings and Mr.  LaTourette from Ohio and particularly also my Florida colleague, Ranking Member JOHN MICA, for moving this resolution through their committee and allowing it to come on the floor today. I also want to thank my colleagues from Florida who have shown their bipartisan support for this resolution,  which is indicative of how important the issue of marine security is for our State. I would like to thank all of our colleagues who have cosponsored this particular resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe it is necessary to emphasize the importance of increasing maritime domain awareness and encourage recreational boaters and others to report suspicious and unusual activities, which is what America's Waterway Watch program does. I urge all of my colleagues to embrace the goals of this program and our shared responsibility for homeland security by supporting House Resolution 549.</paragraph>
