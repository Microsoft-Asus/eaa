  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (<bill type="hc" number="34">H. Con. Res. 34</bill>) honoring the life of Percy Lavon Julian, a pioneer in the field of organic chemistry research and development and the first and only African American chemist to be inducted into the National Academy of Sciences.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on House Concurrent Resolution 34, the resolution that is now under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mine is a simple concurrent resolution honoring the life of Dr. Percy Lavon Julian. Dr. Julian was an outstanding chemist and, as a black man, overcame countless obstacles to achieve international recognition for his scientific accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He spent his youth in Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama. When he decided to leave home to go to college to DePauw University in Indiana, his entire family came to see him off at the train station, including his 99-year-old grandmother, a former slave, and his grandfather who was also there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His grandfather's right hand was two fingers short. The fingers had been cut off for violating the code forbidding slaves to learn to read and write.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At DePauw University, Julian worked in the attic of a fraternity house. His support and tuition came  from his earnings as a waiter. Often he worked as a ditch digger during the day and attended classes in the evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though at the top of his class in college, he was discouraged from pursuing graduate studies because of potential racial sentiment on the part of future coworkers and employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I firmly believe that no one should be discouraged from pursuing their dreams. Nancy Pelosi, our first female Speaker of the House, is a prime example of someone who ignored the words of naysayers. We must hold these people up as examples. Let them light the paths of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Julian earned a fellowship to study chemistry at Harvard University, where he received his master's degree; and in 1931, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Vienna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Julian synthesized a chemical treatment for glaucoma, and he synthesized cortisone for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. He is also noted for inventing a foam used during World War II to extinguish gasoline and oil; and over the course of his career, he acquired more than 100 patents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Julian received wide recognition by the scientific community for his research and was elected into the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. He was a bright, talented individual who excelled in science in the face of overwhelming challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, House Concurrent Resolution 34, honors his life. We have 12 cosponsors, as well as partnership with the other body from the gentleman from Illinois. I am pleased that the leadership has chosen to pass a bill celebrating the success of an African American. He is a role model, and we want our young people to know that you can make it even in spite of some of the hardships that you have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for future generations coming along, the minority students, I feel it important to uplift women and minorities to excel in math, science and engineering. I hope the House leadership will consider substantial policies to encourage more women and minorities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. They need more help than what is currently being provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, again, I thank Chairman Gordon and my colleagues for their support of this resolution. It is a good start, and I hope a bellwether for future legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as my good friend and colleague, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, has already stated, House Concurrent Resolution 34 honors the life of Dr. Percy Lavon Julian, a pioneer in organic chemistry, research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Julian identified and synthesized, and my trusty assistant had to tell me how to pronounce it, physostigmine. I should know that from medical school. Dr. Julian, though, synthesized that, and it is a drug used to treat glaucoma. I think we all know about glaucoma and the ravages of that, particularly with our elderly, more recently to improve memory in Alzheimer's patients and as an antidote to nerve gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also made great advances, Madam Speaker, in synthesizing the drug known, as we all know, as cortisone, and making it affordable treatment back then for arthritis, and of course, it is used for that and many other things today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his glaucoma and arthritis treatment contributions, Dr. Julian's impressive achievements also include the invention of a soy-based fire extinguishing foam used on Navy ships during World War II, various improvements in paints and coatings while employed with the Glidden Paint Company, with which he was affiliated, I think, for over 18 years; and he developed a method to filter chemicals in soybean oil to mass produce hormones for medical application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, Madam Speaker, as a retired OB/GYN physician, I know a little bit about the use of hormones for medical conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an African American in the early 20th century, Dr. Julian overcame great adversity to succeed and to make his mark on society. The National Academy of Sciences recognized and honored his significant contributions to organic chemistry when they inducted him in 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I remember to this day my organic chemistry teacher at Georgia Tech in those 5, 6-hour labs that we had twice a week in addition to all the classroom work. I wish I had had the privilege of being taught by Dr. Julian, but Dr. Cherry was a fine professor in his own right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to give Dr. Julian the same recognition today and support this resolution honoring him and his great life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know all of the folks out in the Bay Area of California are indeed pleased and proud to see you in the Chair. They are as proud as the people in the neighborhood where I live are of Dr. Percy Lavon Julian who lived a few blocks from where I currently live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Born the son of a railroad clerk and a school teacher, the grandson of a slave, young Percy Julian, early in his life, got ahold of Donald Adams' poem, "Seven Fold," and its charge to "Go Farther On" reigned in his spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In academia, racial prejudice followed him like a shadow. He was class valedictorian in 1920 from DePauw University, but still discouraged from seeking admission into graduate school because of potential racial sentiment on the part of future coworkers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He got straight A's at Harvard University, graduated in 1923. But even with his success, Julian was unable to get a teaching job at any major university because of the perception that white students would refuse to learn under a black instructor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After he received a Ph.D. degree in organic chemistry at the University of Vienna in 1931, he took a position at DePauw, his alma mater, where he collaborated with Dr. Josef Pikl and successfully created a drug which was used as a treatment for glaucoma. Although internationally recognized for his achievement, however, the color of his skin prevented him from being appointed chair of DePauw's chemistry department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He became the chief chemist and the director of research at the Glidden Company in Chicago, where he created a flame retardant that saved countless sailors of the United States Navy during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add that my brother worked at Glidden Durkee as a quality control director, because he somehow or another also became a chemist and followed in the footsteps of Dr. Julian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He discovered that soy sterol could be used to manufacture male and female hormones, progesterone and testosterone. Yet his achievements were not properly appreciated. He created synthetic cortisone, and his products led directly to the development of chemical birth control and medicines to suppress the immune system, crucial in performing organ transplants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was named Chicagoan of the Year in 1950. He became the first black to move into the prestigious Oak Park community, but his house was firebombed twice simply because some folk didn't want a black neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He parlayed his genius into countless awards, has over 100 patents to his credit, became a millionaire in 1961, was asked to serve on numerous commissions and advisory boards, and yet his story is not taught nearly as much as it needs to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Racial obstacles can be pernicious, but if we persist, like Dr. Julian, to "Go Farther On," then we all become proud. I am proud of the folks in the community where I live because there are Percy Julian artifacts and memorabilia, schools named after him, streets named after him. He is an icon in the Oak Park community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend again my colleague from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I had one other request for time, but he is detained at this point. Right now, I don't have any other speakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to Dr. HOLT, the gentleman from New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have heard about the numerous obstacles that Dr. Julian faced, no public high schools for African-Americans in Montgomery, so he had to go as a subfreshman to DePauw University, but his skill, his intelligence, allowed him to thrive there against the adversity. We have heard that a research job fell through because African-Americans were not allowed to stay overnight in a town in Wisconsin where he was going for that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard about his contributions: fire retardants, treatments for glaucoma, a low-cost process to produce cortisone. That brings us up to today, why we are talking about this. Of course, we want to honor and recognize someone of such skill and such perseverance, but we want to highlight it for a reason, and that reason is that even today we are excluding people whose talents we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>African-Americans constitute 14 percent or so of the U.S. population, but receive fewer than 4 percent of the doctorates awarded in chemistry and chemical engineering; hold about 1 percent, one out of 100 chemistry faculty positions in the top universities. These distressing numbers are not just an indication of unfairness. They are an indication of the loss of talent, the loss of creativity, that we need in our society. So this is not just to extol the accomplishments of Percy Julian, but to  remind us that we have to make way for these talented individuals in our society today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, just a few words in closing. We talked about Engineers' Week in the previous suspension resolution. I was just listening to my good friend, Rush Holt, talk about the importance of making sure that we encourage people of color and someone like Dr. Julian and many more like him to get an opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure it must have been awfully difficult back in those days, and actually in 1961, that was when I was a student at Georgia Tech, and there were literally no African-American students at school. I don't remember any at that time, and that was just, what, 46 years ago. It is unbelievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, thank God, you know, times have changed; and certainly to learn about Dr. Julian, I didn't know of him until my colleagues on the majority side, on the Science Committee, brought forward this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to manage for the ranking member, Mr. Hall, on this side of the Science Committee and to get to know more about the life of Dr. Percy Julian, talking about the work he did in developing and manufacturing a process for the production of cortisone. Madam Speaker, I can really appreciate him in regard to that, because just yesterday morning, I was lying on an operating table getting cortisone injected into my arthritic neck, and I feel better already. I will say, Thank you,  Dr. Julian, for that discovery, and I appreciate it very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is an honor to pay respect to this gentleman. I am pleased in a reading of his life that, unlike a lot of other people who do great things, and they get honored 25 years after their death, and everybody else seems to capitalize on their discovery, the fact that he was not only honored in his lifetime by the National Academy of Sciences, but also was able to get financial remuneration for his work in the sale of his company to a big pharmaceutical, I think it was Smith, Kline &amp; French or  one of the major pharmaceutical companies back in 1961 purchased his company for $2.1 million. Well, that is great, and I am very happy that occurred and happy for him and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is great to have these good bipartisan opportunities, Madam Speaker. I want to ask all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I know all my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to support this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="34">H. Res. 34</bill>, which gives long overdue recognition to a great American, Dr. Percy Lavon Julian. Dr. Julian was a brilliant African-American scientist, inventor, civil rights leader and an unsung hero. A pioneer and widely acclaimed for his work in organic chemistry, Dr. Percy broke the color barrier in science. During his lifetime, he made great strides in the field of chemistry. In 1973, he was elected to the National Academy  of Sciences in recognition of his outstanding lifetime achievements. He received 19 honorary degrees and was awarded 105 patents, among them a foam fire retardant, a treatment for glaucoma, and a low-cost process to produce cortisone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in 1899, in Montgomery, AL, the grandson of slaves, Dr. Julian overcame many obstacles and racism and went on to be the first member of his family to attend college. He was the valedictorian of his graduating class at DePauw University in 1920, then went on to receive his M.S. from Harvard University in 1923 and later getting his Ph.D. from the University of Vienna in 1931.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time of inequality for African-Americans, Dr. Julian persevered and pioneered a commercial process to synthesize cortisone from soy beans and yams, enabling the widespread use of cortisone as an affordable treatment of arthritis. Dr. Julian also became the first to discover a process to synthesize physotigmine, the drug used in the treatment of glaucoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Julian broke down barriers to achieve many significant firsts in his lifetime, one of which was becoming the first Black scientist hired for a high-level corporate research position as director of research at the Glidden Company. It was here during his 18-year tenure that he launched a process for the chemical synthesis of cortisone whose affordability promulgated its widespread use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only was Dr. Julian an esteemed scientist and innovator, he was also a leader in his community and a champion for civil rights. In 1950, on Thanksgiving Day, before moving in to his new home in the exclusive Chicago Oak Park neighborhood, his home was firebombed. Not one to crumble in the face of adversity, Dr. Julian instead fought tirelessly for integration and went on to encourage the Human Relations Commission in the village government and the Oak Park Housing Center in Illinois towards  becoming one of the most efficient systems of integration in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Julian's business savvy was showcased in 1954 when he left the Glidden Company to establish his own laboratories, Julian Laboratories. There he specialized in producing his synthetic cortizone and established Laboratorios Julian de Mexico in Mexico City and used wild yams in Mexico, which he found to be more effective than soy beans for some of his products. His business savvy was further evidenced when he sold the Oak Park plant to Smith, Kline, and Smith for $2.3 million, an astounding  amount of money for anyone during that time period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Julian played an integral role in his Chicago community as a civil rights activist. He founded the National Negro Business and Professional Committee for the Legal Defense fund, raised funds for the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many African-American pioneers and leaders, who came long before the civil rights movement for equality, were not recognized for the contributions they made to this Nation and were never thanked for bettering our society and contributing to humanity. Too many were forgotten and unrecognized for their diligence and commitment to their field of work and their contribution that continues to affect each and every one of our lives today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we draw closer to the month of February and Black History month is recognized, let us take a moment to honor an unsung hero, let us declare that his memory is not forgotten. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and honor Dr. Julian Percy because he embodies the ideals that make America a great nation: pioneering spirit, hard work, innovation, perseverance, and dedication.</paragraph>
