    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me quickly indicate that the three combatant commanders who have been nominated are part of this list. Admiral Roughead, who is nominated to be the Chief of Naval Operations, is also on this list. I point out, particularly with Senator Warner on the floor but even if he was not on the floor, not only does he play an active role in moving these nominations very expeditiously--and this is as expeditious as any nomination could move. We had the hearings yesterday,  I believe, and we had the markup last night and the nomination is on the floor today for these combatant commanders and CNO. Senator Warner, with his particular history with the U.S. Navy, was keeping an especially keen eye on the nomination of Admiral Roughead. That doesn't diminish his interest in</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and long-time friend of 29 years, standing here together with the Defense bill. It was important in this case. On Monday, the current Chief of Naval Operations, a man of great distinction, Admiral Mullen, as we say in the Navy, lowered his flag as Chief of Naval Operations and becomes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I felt it imperative there not be a moment's gap in the Navy for the new Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral  Roughead, who is in this group of nominations confirmed by the Senate, and that he be in position to assume the full responsibilities as soon as he is able to take the oath of office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend. I thank him kindly for his personal mention. I have had a long association with the U.S. Navy. I have learned more from them than they have ever learned from me, beginning as a young sailor a half century ago. I feel a strong obligation toward all men and women in the Armed Forces, as does my distinguished chairman, but there is something very special about the U.S. Navy. I was privileged for 5 years to serve as Under Secretary and Secretary many years ago. So there will  not be a gap. I thank my chairman for making that possible and allowing me to go forward with this nomination.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="IN THE NAVY">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to take this time to thank my good friends and managers of this bill, and leaders of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, for moving forward and moving quickly with the nomination of Admiral Roughead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention this because I knew Admiral Roughead personally as he served in the Pacific Command. I can recall how he was a great leader in the role of taking relief to the tsunami victims in the southeast Asia area of the Pacific while he was Deputy Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. He was recently the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the great fortune to work with Admiral Roughead during his tenure as deputy commander, U.S. Pacific Command, and commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet and was consistently impressed by his skills as commanding officer, dedication to duty and commitment to protecting and defending our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1973, Admiral Roughead has served this country with absolute distinction in a variety of positions including most recently commander, U.S. Fleet Forces. In particular, I want to note the leadership and compassion Admiral Roughead, as deputy commander, U.S. Pacific Command, displayed during the United States Navy's participation in the international response to the destruction following the December 2004 tsunami in South and Southeast Asia. Similarly  Admiral Roughead has demonstrated his deep understanding of the importance of honoring cultural diversity. In his capacity as representative of our U.S. naval forces, he has truly embodied the true spirit of aloha in his interactions with the many diverse communities in my home state of Hawaii.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with Admiral Roughead in his new capacity and I am pleased to support his confirmation as chief of Naval Operations.</paragraph>
