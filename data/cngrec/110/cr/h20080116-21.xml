  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#xE1;zquez) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.</chair>
  <chair>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</chair>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <chair>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, this body has heard time and again of the courage, discipline and selflessness with which our veterans serve this Nation. What is less well known, however, are the contributions that veterans make to our Nation's economy.</chair>
  <chair>Last month, 407 Members of this House voted to pass <bill type="h" number="4253">H.R. 4253</bill>. This bill represented an important step toward a comprehensive update of the Small Business Administration's veterans assistance programs, programs which remove barriers to veterans' self-employment and provide veteran entrepreneurs with support for growth and expansion. Again, I wish to commend Congressman Jason Altmire and Congressman Vern Buchanan for their leadership on this legislation.</chair>
  <chair>Not long after this body passed <bill type="h" number="4253">H.R. 4253</bill>, the Senate took up the legislation and offered a number of changes. The resolution we are considering today provides for the concurrence in the Senate amendment and makes additional changes of our own.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment in this resolution does two things. First, the amendment makes technical revisions to clarify language in the bill. Second, the amendment removes a nongermane provision that was inserted by the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="4253">H.R. 4253</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue, the number of returning veterans will only increase. Our support for veterans, however, does not end with their deployment. We must continue to work to support these budding entrepreneurs as they reach for the American dream of business ownership. I believe the underlying bill is a major step towards realizing this goal, and I strongly support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</chair>
  <chair>I reserve the balance of my time.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the request to suspend the rules and pass House Resolution 921, which agrees to the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="4253">H.R. 4253</bill>, the Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization Opportunity Act of 2007, subject to an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#xE1;zquez for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this resolution to the floor, which, again, incorporates a number of provisions of a bill authored by Mr. Buchanan from Florida, a freshman member of the Small Business Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions of this resolution are substantially similar to those contained in <bill type="h" number="4253">H.R. 4253</bill> passed by the House in the last session. For the sake of brevity, interested parties can refer to the December 5, 2007 Congressional Record for that statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution makes necessary technical changes to the Senate amendment. The House bill required the establishment of an interagency task force to improve business advice given to veteran-owned small businesses. This resolution restores the requirement that the interagency task force include the advice from veteran service organizations. It makes no sense to try and improve veterans services to veterans without actually consulting them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reservists have their own set of operational problems, especially if they own a business or are a key employee in a small business. These Reservists are making a sacrifice to the health of their business in order to protect the liberty and freedom of all Americans. The least we can do is provide the small businesses owned by or employing these Reservists sufficient access to advice and capital to enable their businesses to survive during their absence. The resolution before us today does just  that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, the resolution ensures that small communities where a Reservist-owned business is a major source of employment will have access to economic injury disaster loan funds from the SBA to pay employees and meet other expenses while the owner is on active duty. Small communities that rely on one employer should not have to suffer because the owner of a business has elected the noble obligation to serve our country in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the resolution adopts a modified form of the reduction in costs for guaranteed loans made to veterans under SBA's 7(a) loan program. I commend the chairwoman for taking an approach that helps veterans obtain loans without unduly increasing costs to the American taxpayer or other borrowers under the 7(a) loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one can dispute the sacrifice that America's veterans have made and continue to make in defense of our country. While the repayment of that debt may never be fully compensated, we can never fully pay back those that have served this country so honorably in uniform, we can certainly provide them with the needed assistance to prosper in civilian life. Today's resolution will do that. I want to thank the chairwoman again for working to make this possible and thank Mr. Buchanan for his  leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, a lead sponsor of the bill, Mr. Jason Altmire, as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last month the House and the Senate passed the Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act to expand business opportunities for veterans and Reservists. And after Senate action, today we will vote again to pass this legislation that I introduced to ensure veterans and Reservists are afforded every opportunity for economic success at home given their sacrifices abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Starting and maintaining a small business can be challenging for anyone, and unfortunately veterans often face unique obstacles as a result of their military service. The unemployment rate among veterans is more than twice that of the national average, and nearly 40 percent of Reservists lose income when they are deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Congress has taken action to provide Federal agencies with resources to encourage entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans, I believe that more can still be done to relieve the burden that is placed on small business owners during and after deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when our veteran population continues to grow, it is more important than ever for us to afford our brave men and women in uniform every opportunity for success. The Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act provides the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development with the resources necessary to expand entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans and Reservists and improve existing programs to help keep small businesses afloat while their members  are deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment we will consider today makes minor changes to the bill we passed in December, but the intent remains the same. This legislation increases funding for the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development, improves programs designed to help relieve the burden placed on small business owners during and after deployments, facilitates the coordination of all Federal agencies to focus attention on expanding opportunities for veteran-owned businesses, makes the SBA Advisory Committee on Veterans  Business Affairs permanent, and increases the number of veterans business outreach centers across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is no question that veterans have a unique ability to thrive as entrepreneurs. They have the skill and the drive necessary to run successful businesses. But more must be done to help them fulfill their goals and their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this legislation, which I introduced, and I ask my colleagues for their support of the Military Reservist and Veterans Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act, and urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Lastly, Madam Speaker, I would thank the gentleman from Florida, my good friend, Mr. Buchanan; the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for their help in working through these issues. And hopefully now, with the work of the chairwoman, we can have a bill that can pass both Chambers and move to the President's desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would just like to commend two freshman Members. I think this is another example that shows bipartisanship on the Small Business Committee, to the credit of the chairwoman, Ms. Vel&#xE1;zquez, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire), a freshman Member, and Mr. Buchanan, a freshman Member from Florida, working together to benefit veterans and small businesses in this country. So I think I'd like to see that spirit illustrated in the  rest of the Congress, and I want to thank again Mr. Altmire and Mr. Buchanan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Buchanan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding me the time, and I rise in support of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to thank my fellow freshman, Congressman Altmire, and I want to thank the chairman of our Small Business Committee, because she has been very bipartisan from day one. She's been very helpful to me, and I think, frankly, this is what the country is looking for. So I want to thank the freshman Congressman. I think this is a very powerful thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I just wanted to say that I know there's a Senate compromise, and a number of provisions in that are important to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution incorporates legislation I introduced in May and the House passed in June, creating an important program within the Small Business Administration. This will give our veterans not just a chance at success in a small business enterprise, but provide them with the help and assistance a grateful Nation can offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation is intended to help veterans through grants, information services and contacts with professionals in their field of endeavor. This Federal support will enhance the ability of veterans to become an entrepreneur in his or her own right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure puts an emphasis on providing veterans with the market research, financial options, and technological training important to becoming a successful small business owner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation not only expands the number but the scope of Veteran Outreach Centers. It ensures the opening of more doors in terms of that and the opportunity for women veterans. Assisting our women returning from combat has been an area long overlooked, and it's high time we did something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know in my personal situation, I went in as an 18-year-old in the Air National Guard. At 23, I had a chance to get in business for myself, for a kid that grew up in a blue-collar family, and I've lived that American Dream, being self-employed for 30 years. I want to make sure that our veterans have that same opportunity today for all the sacrifices they are making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm excited today that the House will pass a resolution that will help individuals make an important transition from a veteran to a small business entrepreneur, and we are one step closer to having this important legislation signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to suspend the rules and support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, but I reserve the right to close.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I just want to take the opportunity again to thank Ranking Member Chabot and Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Altmire and also the staff from the Democratic side and the Republican side for working in a bipartisan manner to help achieve this goal of providing the tools necessary for the veterans who are returning home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="hr" number="921">H. Res. 921</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#xE1;zquez) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="921">H. Res. 921</bill>.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <chair>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</chair>
  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
