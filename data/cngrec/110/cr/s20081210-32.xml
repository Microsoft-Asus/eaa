  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10861">S10861</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="CAPTAIN ROB YLLESCAS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to honor Army CPT Rob Yllescas who was wounded in Afghanistan on October 28, 2008, and tragically succumbed to his injuries on December 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Yllescas, who was a native of Guatemala, attended the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, where he met his wife, Dena, a native of Osceola, NE. He came to call our State home, and today I know that every one of my fellow Nebraskans is proud to claim Captain Yllescas as one of our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Yllescas commanded B-Troop, 6-4 Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, The Big Red One, where 90 American troops and more than 200 Afghan fighters were under his command. A graduate of Army Ranger School, Captain Yllescas had deployed twice before during his 10-year military career, both times to Iraq. His fellow soldiers recognized and respected Captain Yllescas's commitment to the missions he performed. Although trained as a warfighter, Captain Yllescas knew the importance  of connecting with the local populations and was known to sit down with local leaders for tea and discussions of democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After he was severely injured by an improvised explosive device, Captain  Yllescas was strong enough to survive a lengthy medical evacuation which eventually brought him to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. With Dena and other family members at his side, Captain Yllescas underwent almost daily surgeries in the hope of recovery. Dena Yllescas chronicled his hospitalization on an Internet blog which drew tens of thousands of readers. Friends,  relatives and total strangers all followed Captain Yllescas's progress and prayed for his recovery. President George W. Bush made a special trip to the medical center and awarded Captain Yllescas the Purple Heart in a brief ceremony on November 10.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Yllescas knew the dangers he faced and the risks he took. He also knew the importance of the work he did in the Army on behalf of his fellow Americans. He risked and ultimately sacrificed his own life so that people a world away could have the chance to enjoy the freedoms he had found in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Yllescas is survived by his wife, Dena, and daughters Julia, age 7, and Eva, 10 months; parents, Barbara Yllescas of Lincoln and Otto Yllescas of Guatemala; a brother, Christopher of Columbia, MO; and two sisters, Jennifer Winterbauer of Lincoln and Natalie Yllescas of Guatemala.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The life and service of Captain Yllescas represents an example we can all look up to and seek to emulate. He served his country honorably and made the ultimate sacrifice in furtherance of a much larger goal. Captain Yllescas made the most of his short life, and the greatest tragedy is that now it is impossible to know what more this promising young man might have accomplished. I join all Nebraskans in mourning the loss of Captain Yllescas and in offering my deepest condolences to his family.</paragraph>
