  <narrative>FISA REAUTHORIZATION -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1157]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. HOEKSTRA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is day 12, day 12 of diminished capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community to go out and get the information that they need to collect to keep America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our National Director of Intelligence, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee all have said that with the failure of the House to act on restoring and approving a FISA modernization bill America's capabilities erode each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what is the House going to do today? <bill type="s" number="2478">S. 2478</bill>, naming a post office; <bill type="s" number="2272">S. 2272</bill>, naming a post office. The third bill we'll consider today, naming a post office. The fourth bill, naming a post office. We'll do four other noncontroversial bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then what we will do? Will we take up FISA modernization? No, we will do the same thing we did 2 weeks ago: we will go home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The schedule for Friday? On Friday, no votes are expected. Our capabilities will diminish for 4 more days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"House Democrats In a Perilous Game," is what The Republican of Springfield, Massachusetts, said. "The House let a crucial deadline come and go without even taking a vote on this matter."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's at greater risk because this House continues to fail to act.</paragraph>
