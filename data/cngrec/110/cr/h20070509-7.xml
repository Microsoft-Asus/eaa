  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress has the power to end the war in Iraq simply by refusing to pass any legislation to continue to fund it. The money is in the pipeline there right now to bring the troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill> provides a plan for bringing the troops home, ending the occupation and stabilizing Iraq. This war will never end if Congress advances administration plans to privatize Iraq's oil through insisting on the passage of a so-called hydrocarbon act by the Iraqi legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I will be distributing to Members of Congress a detailed report that explains how the legislation that we are advancing moves to privatize Iraq's oil.</paragraph>
