    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this time to congratulate Mr. James Pelletier of Rhinelander, WI, on being awarded the French Legion of Honor for his extraordinary bravery in liberating France during the Second World War. The Legion of Honor is the highest honor awarded by the nation of France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December of 1942, at the age of 18, Mr. Pelletier joined the U.S. Army. He took part in military campaigns in northern France and in the Ardennes Raid. He participated in battles to help the allies take back many cities, including Nogent, Conches and Versailles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Second World War has so much significance in modern history. An entire generation rallied together to defend the rights of freedom and liberty, not just for the United States but for the entire world. The world in which we live was shaped by the actions of these brave soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Pelletier is a member of our Greatest Generation that built modern America. Their efforts kept us safe and allowed our communities to flourish. These heroes were united in the common values of duty, honor, service and love of country. As a nation, we are forever grateful for the sacrifices and courage of these brave veterans of the Second World War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our State and Nation, I congratulate Mr. James Pelletier and his family on this prestigious honor and thank him for his brave service.</paragraph>
