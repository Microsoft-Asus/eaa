    <paragraph>Mr. President, the international community's effort to press Iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment has been virtually grounded as of late and there does not seem to be a way out. This deadlock is of great concern to me--particularly because of the threat Iran poses to our national security strategy but also because I do not trust this administration to make the right choices when it comes to our safety and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a known sponsor of international terrorism, and in light of President Ahmadinejad's belligerent statements calling for Israel to be "wiped off the map," we must redouble our efforts to ensure Iran is no longer allowed to violate international treaties, does not develop nuclear weapons, and does not become any more of a threat to our national security than it already is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History has taught us that we cannot ignore the stated intent of those who seek to destroy other nations. A nuclear Iran would be a grave threat to the region, to Israel, and to the entire international community but that does not mean we should act rashly or act alone. Indeed, recent history has also shown that we are at our strongest--and most secure--when we are part of a strong multilateral team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, the Bush administration's saber-rattling flies in the face of any effort to legitimately build consensus for effective dealings with Iran. Our allies at the United Nations have worked with us in the past to support a resolution sanctioning Iran but they may not be willing to work with us again if these confrontations in the Persian Gulf become habitual occurrences. Such threats are stunningly counterproductive as they embolden Iranian hardliners to dig in their heels, undermine our multilateral  commitments, and jeopardize our national security significantly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iran's ability to sniff out and exploit fissures within the international community and use it to their advantage should not be underestimated. Knowing this, it is in the interest of our national security to ensure there is strong unanimity among our allies at the United Nations. Critical to this effort is cooperation from Russia and China. To ensure they are on board, this administration must prioritize robust diplomacy with these two countries to ensure they are on board and engaged. Without  them, there can be no real headway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month an International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, report said that Iran has not suspended its enrichment activities and we must take this claim very seriously. We must work with our allies to take concerted, decisive action to break this stalemate. The Security Council must speak with one voice and send a clear signal that continued defiance of the international community will not be tolerated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential that all U.N. member states and the international community, more generally, continue to condemn the violent and defiant rhetoric of Iran's President. If his aggressive words go unchecked it could signal approval of the Iranian regime's determination to undermine its international obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress can also take critical steps to stop or slow Iran's nuclear enrichment, but we will not be effective in doing so unless we acknowledge that the United States must be in lock-step with the international community if we are to overcome decades of mistrust and ongoing threats to our national security.</paragraph>
