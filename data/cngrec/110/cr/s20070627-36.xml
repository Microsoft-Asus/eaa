    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a friend and distinguished North Dakotan, Francis Cree, who passed away on June 15 at the age of 86.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Francis Cree was a highly respected Ojibwe elder of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota. He was the official pipe carrier for the tribe, a position of honor and leadership. He led the tribe as chairman in the 1960s and served several terms on tribal council. Francis spent countless hours teaching young people about Ojibwe culture and traditions. He was also a singer, a crafter and artist, a spiritual leader, a carver of pipes, and a keeper of the ceremonial drum for the Dunseith  community. On November 8, 2001, we had the honor here in the Senate of being led in opening prayer by Francis. It was indeed a proud day for Francis and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Francis was married to Rose Cree, herself a well-known artist who made beautiful willow baskets, several of which were featured at the Smithsonian's Festival of American Folk Life on The Mall here in our Nation's Capital. The Crees collaborated on these baskets. Both collected the materials, while Francis made the frames from ash, and Rose wove the willows. In 2002, Francis and Rose received the National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship, which recognizes the significant contributions  of American folk artists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Francis was a kind, humble, and generous man. He gave selflessly and never expected or wanted anything in return. Francis and Rose raised 14 children and opened their hearts and home to many more. They were also proud grandparents to more than 100 grandchildren and great-grandchildren and many, many great-great grandchildren. Each and every one of them is a reflection of Francis's caring and endearing spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a tremendous loss for the Cree family, but it is also an incredible loss to North Dakota and the Nation. Francis's life and the legacy he leaves behind is truly an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
