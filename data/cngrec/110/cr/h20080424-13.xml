    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning  to honor the thousands of American workers who are injured, sickened, and killed each year in this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next Monday, April 28, is Workers Memorial Day, dedicated to remembering workers whose lives are lost on the job. Sixteen workers are killed on the job every day in America. Every. Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And these are not just workers in highly dangerous professions, but workers from every profession you can imagine, from mechanics to teachers to newspaper carriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of addressing the crisis in worker safety, the Bush administration continues to underfund the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA. Like an old dog who's lost its teeth, OSHA doesn't scare anyone. It hasn't improved safety and it doesn't protect workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I stand with families who have lost loved ones on the job. Tomorrow I continue working with my colleagues in the Labor and Working Families Caucus to strengthen OSHA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American workers deserve to be safe while earning a living and contributing to this great country. And we must do more to ensure that they are safe.</paragraph>
