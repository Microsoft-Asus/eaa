  <narrative>COST OF THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7856]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has cost, as of last week, every man, woman and child in my district, New York's 19th district, $3,077. Now, for that $3,077, the men, women and children of my district have paid for a war that was a strategic mistake and has been horribly mismanaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the latest example, USA Today revealed that the Pentagon has been even slower than we thought in providing safer vehicles for our troops. According to e-mails within the Pentagon, a Marine general in Iraq requested MRAPs, mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, as far back as December 2003. These vehicles offer the best protection from IEDs for our troops. The number one killer of troops in Iraq are IEDs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, while Pentagon leadership delayed in providing these vehicles to U.S. troops, they decided to equip the Iraqi Army with these vehicles, while leaving our soldiers with Humvees. This resulted in the unnecessary deaths of at least 600 Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For $3,000, the taxpayers of my district paid for the best equipment we could buy for the Iraqi Army, but left our soldiers and marines with substandard Humvees. It is time we reorient our priorities, protect our own soldiers, and end this war.</paragraph>
