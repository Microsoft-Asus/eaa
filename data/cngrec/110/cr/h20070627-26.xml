  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday, Senator Lugar, the former chairman and current ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went to the Senate floor and said that the President's troop escalation is not working. Then yesterday Republican Senator Voinovich said the U.S. should begin pulling troops out of Iraq so that people know we are indeed disengaging. But the President and his spokesman said, no, we need more troops and more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been clear for at least a year that a serious course correction is needed in Iraq. But, unfortunately, Republicans in this House of Representatives continue to rubber stamp the Bush administration's war policies. Democrats are changing the course of this misguided war, but with a stubborn President unwilling to face reality, congressional Republicans must break ranks with the President to do what is best for our Nation and for Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that the congressional Republicans will seriously listen to their colleagues' comments and conclude, as Democrats already have, that we need to dramatically change our policy in Iraq.</paragraph>
