  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to another great American hero. On July 15, 2006, Specialist Nathan Gurley of Fayetteville, North Carolina, though wounded, fiercely pulled Specialist Josh Eckley of Little York, Illinois and another crew member from a military vehicle that had been hit by an IED while on combat logistics control in Al Anbar Province in Iraq. For his heroism, Specialist Gurley was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor and the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of the 17th District of Illinois, I thank Specialist Gurley for saving the life of one of our beloved sons. Specialist Gurley and Specialist Eckley represent the best the United States military has to offer in Iraq. These two brave soldiers risked their lives to fight an unrelenting insurgency in one of our country's most dangerous areas. For their service, the American people will be forever indebted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, brave men such as Specialist Gurley and Specialist Eckley are hard to come by, so for their sake and for all those continuing to fight, it is my sincere hope that at the conclusion of this war their sacrifice will not be in vain.</paragraph>
