    <paragraph>Mr. President, I missed the 10:30 a.m. vote today because I was at Arlington Cemetery for the interment services for LTG Robert Allen Breitweiser. Lieutenant General Breitweiser was one of the commanding officers of the Fourteenth Air Force when I served in the China-Burma-India theater, and he turned into a good friend when he was assigned to the Alaskan North American Air Defense Command from 1967 to 1969. It was also an occasion for me because Lieutenant General Breitweiser's  assistant was Tony Langhorn Motley, who, along with me, survived the airplane crash in which my wife and four others were killed in 1978.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant General Breitweiser's full biography be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
