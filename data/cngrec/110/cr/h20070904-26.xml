  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying how I wish we had followed a more open and inclusive process up to this point. My friends on the other side of the aisle pledged during the campaign that the 110th Congress would be the most fair, open and honest in history. Yet it is my understanding that the Democrats are close to finalizing an agreement on a conference report before conferees have even been named and with little input from House Republicans. There is nothing fair, open or honest about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Budget Committee chairman predicted months ago that the budget reconciliation process was in danger of being abused as a "stalking horse" for new spending, and looking back he could not have been more on target. The House bill in fact included one of the most significant increases in higher education entitlement spending we have ever witnessed, establishing nine new entitlement programs. And bear in mind most of that new spending isn't even targeted toward low-income students who  need it the most, but rather at institutions, philanthropic organizations, and graduates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a remarkable change from the historic function of Federal student aid programs. For more than four decades, these programs have existed for a single purpose, to give our neediest students a chance at obtaining a college degree and pursuing the American Dream. The House bill turns its back on that tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans support strengthening our Nation's student aid programs, but we do not support targeting scarce Federal student aid resources at wealthy philanthropic organizations, universities with million- or billion-dollar endowments and college graduates, and we certainly do not support doing so at the expense of the market- based FFEL program, which has been a success by any measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a way, Mr. Speaker, that we can avoid making this critical mistake. Slightly reducing the cuts to lender subsidies and redirecting funding to provide additional support for Pell Grants, rather than creating costly new entitlement programs, are two steps that could be taken in an effort to achieve bipartisan support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the final step is to include language that would allow for a careful analysis of possible auction scenarios to determine if an auction is really in the best interests of students and taxpayers before requiring its implementation. In fact, I have heard from many Members, including 14 Democrats, who expressed concern about the automatic implementation of an auction and encourage that we approach any auction proposal with caution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the conference report achieves these four goals, I believe we can achieve strong bipartisan support for this bill. Doing anything less could endanger our support and trigger a Presidential veto threat, just as the House bill did in July. So as we prepare to formalize a conference report, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bear this in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe another part of the Senate's reconciliation bill also deserves the attention of this Chamber and inclusion in our conference report, specifically, the provision that would block the importation of terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay into American communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are a Nation at war and Guantanamo provides the highest level of security to ensure our enemies do not endanger American lives. Some Democrats have suggested that the site be closed and terrorists be sent into American communities such as Edwards Air Force Base in my district, Fort Knox, Kentucky, Quantico, Virginia, and others. But make no mistake: transferring terrorist detainees to these communities will create an opportunity for our enemies to escape, recruit and disseminate their terrorist  skills, and it would make these domestic facilities prime targets for any attack that al Qaeda is able to mount within our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress simply should not allow this to occur, and I thank the Senate for including this important language in its reconciliation bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same by voting "yes" on this motion to instruct.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of proceeding with the conference negotiations on <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007. In appointing conferees today, I am proud to say that we will be taking the first step in making college more affordable and accessible for students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, this is an opportunity for the conference to look at both bills, consider concerns and put forth the best possible compromise; and that is our goal. During this process, not only have we looked carefully at what will work for students and families, but we have done our best to listen to and address the concerns brought to our attention. In an attempt at bipartisanship, we have met with the administration, as well as the staff from the other side of the aisle, in such discussions and  with the administration, and we believe at the end of the day the conference will include provisions that have broad bipartisan support while maintaining some of our key priorities. These include the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Significant investment in Pell Grants. We heard the concern voiced on this floor by Members on the other side of the aisle, and we believe it is important to include a significant investment beyond the House bill in this conference. Understanding that increasing Pell Grants is also an issue included in President Bush's budget, we believe this goal can and should be met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cutting interest rates in half will remain a key priority for helping the middle class as well as ensuring debt relief for students and delivery of such needed financial support for Historical Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic serving institutions and other minority serving institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that we can continue the dialogue and work together on final passage in the conference. I am very proud to be here today to offer this motion to officially proceed in the conference with the Senate on legislation that will allow the Congress to do more to help Americans pay for the cost of college than any effort since the GI Bill at no cost to the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 will get us closer to the goal of ensuring access to higher education for all qualified students.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Senate rejected transferring al Qaeda terrorists from Guantanamo to facilities in the United States by a vote of 94-3. Senator McConnell stated at that time, "It is better for the safety and security of the American people that terrorists at Guantanamo Bay are not moved to American communities. It is the sense of the Senate that detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior members of al Qaeda, should not be transferred stateside into facilities in American  communities and American neighborhoods."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many senior members of al Qaeda are secured at Guantanamo Bay, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who masterminded the September 11 terrorist attacks that killed approximately 3,000 Americans; Majid Khan, who developed plans to poison water supplies inside the United States; Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri, who orchestrated the attacks on the USS Cole which killed 17 United States sailors. This is just a sampling of the people that are in Guantanamo Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are Americans better protected by bringing these terrorists to our homeland, or by keeping captured members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations 528 miles and an ocean away from the homeland? Terrorists held at Guantanamo are treated in accordance with United States and international law and are held at the highest level of security, ensuring that they are not a threat to the United States citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gitmo alternatives include the use of up to 17 military detention facilities. Less secure facilities allow for the recruitment and radicalization of new members within the detention population as well as enhanced escape opportunities. Domestic detention facilities may become prime targets for terrorist attacks on United States soil and they will create uncertainties about detainees' "constitutional rights."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Standards at Guantanamo are equal to or better than similar institutions in the United States. They are relatively new facilities. They have culturally appropriate meals. They have Korans and respectful silence during Islam's five daily prayers. The detainees receive medical care and at least 2 hours of daily outdoor recreation. An inspection official from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in March 2006 called it a model prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bottom line, the Guantanamo Bay facility is a clean, safe and humane facility for the terrorists housed there, as well as a facility that affords security and protection for American citizens. We should accept the Senate language in their bill and make it clear that these prisoners should stay at Guantanamo Bay and that they should not be transferred to facilities in the homeland.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and I thank him for his leadership on this very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we go to conference on this bill and that we pass the College Cost Reduction Act. It provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to help students afford college and to do so at no new cost to the taxpayer. Let me emphasize that point: At no new cost to the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just heard this bill described, I believe, as containing unprecedented new spending, and I think it is important to point out that it is not new spending, it is redirected spending.  With this bill, the Congress is making a choice that we think it is important to take Federal resources, scarce Federal resources, and devote them to assisting needy students in meeting the cost of attending college, and it is more important to do that than it is to see  to it that the student loan providers maintain what are already very healthy profit margins. I think that is a choice that the American people would support us in making, and it is certainly a reasonable choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you were to look at today's front page article in the New York Times, an article that talks about how colleges are not raising tuition but they are raising fees, it underscores one of the central realities of higher education today, and that is, as public support for higher education is reduced, the burden falls on students and their families to make up the difference. We now have an opportunity to assist students and families with making up that difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill significantly increases the Pell Grant maximum, something, by the way, that the President has spoken quite favorably of doing. He has been promising an increase in the Pell Grant maximum since the campaign of 2000. It was not until the Congress acted with the continuing resolution for fiscal year 2007 that that increase became a reality for the first time. And now with this bill, we will dramatically increase the Pell Grant maximum to offset increases in tuition, increases in fees,  and declining public support for education in other areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also cuts student loan interest rates, which is very important. It is a point that continues to be missed by our friends on the other side. Access and affordability isn't just about the cost of attendance when the student is undertaking the cost; it is about looking at their future obligations. What this bill does is it enables students to make clear decisions about what they can afford and what they can't afford and have an expectation of what their future obligations are that is much more  reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an investment. This is the kind of investment that we need to keep this Nation strong, to keep this Nation safe, to keep this Nation competitive. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank again the chairman for his leadership.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I appreciate the gentleman from Michigan for his leadership on this important issue of Gitmo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of the motion to instruct conferees on <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>. When the other body considered this legislation, the Republican leader inserted language to prohibit dangerous terrorists being detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from being transferred to American soil. I believe it is crucial this language remain in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The findings of the sense of the Senate quoted threats of Osama bin Laden. Item 8, Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, said in his 1998 fatwa against the United States that: "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies, civilians and military, is an important individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Item 9 in the same fatwa, Osama bin Laden said: "We, with God's help, call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they can find it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These terrorists currently held at Guantanamo Bay are treated in accordance with U.S. and international laws. I have visited the facility two times, and both times I was impressed by the high level of security and the professional management of the detainees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importing dangerous foreign terrorists, like 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, into American communities would be dangerous and irresponsible. Terrorists would have the opportunity to recruit and teach their skills. Additionally, I am very concerned that they could potentially escape and harm Americans here at home again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since April, American forces have captured two terrorists with strong al Qaeda ties: al-Hadi al-Iraqi, one of al Qaeda's highest ranking and most experienced senior operatives, and Haroon al-Afghani, who has admitted to being a courier for the al Qaeda senior leadership. Both men are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay. Inviting these criminals into American communities would be reckless. Any domestic detention facility would be a prime target for a terrorist attack that al Qaeda could mount  within the borders of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the former chairman of the Lexington County Law Enforcement Advisory Council of Sheriff Jimmy Metts and as a former member of the South Carolina State Senate Corrections and Penology Committee, I am very familiar with corrections facilities. The Guantanamo detention facilities are world class as to humane lodging and security of the inmates and for the personnel who serve as guards or medical support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As America continues to fight the global war on terrorism, I am confident that Guantanamo Bay remains the safest place to detain captured terrorists who pose a serious threat to American families. These terrorists have disclosed terrorist cells which have been stopped from attacking Americans and our allies worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to rise with me in strong support of this motion that would ensure Americans are kept safe from known terrorists.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first speak to the motion to instruct. I have no problems with the motion to instruct. I don't quite know why it is on this bill, but the Senate chose to put this language into the legislation. The motion to instruct would ask the conferees to maintain that language in this legislation so those who are currently at Guantanamo Bay who are among some very dangerous people in the world not be brought to this country in the event that Guantanamo Bay should be closed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, that is a matter of active debate here in the United States and certainly around the world and within the Congress of the United States of exactly how we extricate ourselves from the situation we have at Guantanamo Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early on after 9/11, the use of Guantanamo Bay became a rallying point against the abuse of human rights. Earlier practices there violated the protection of human rights. As the gentleman from Michigan has pointed out, much has changed there, but all is not well there yet, and there have been calls to close that facility. In the event they would be successful, as I understand this language, this would prevent the prisoners from being transferred to facilities in the United States, and I concur  in that language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I might return back to the legislation at hand or the motion at hand, which is to go to conference with the Senate and work out the differences in this legislation, and there are significant differences between the House and the Senate legislation, the staffs of the committee have been meeting on those differences, and we would hope to be able to report back to the House and to the Senate in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we do that. We stand here at the beginning of yet another school year, another college year, if you will, and we see that families are struggling harder than ever to meet the cost of college. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) who has been so active in this field pointed out this fact to the House. We must do what we can to address and help families meet this cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation does it in a number of ways, both by providing increased grants to the lowest income families of students who seek to attend college who are fully qualified to go to college, but too often economic barriers keep them from doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation makes a substantial increase in the Pell Grants, some $500 over the coming years in that grant. It was the goal of this President to do that. Previous Congresses never did that, and we do that in this legislation, and that is going to be a great benefit to those students and to their families who are struggling with the cost of college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also make a reduction in the interest rates. We cut the interest rates  in half on money borrowed from the subsidized loan program which includes those very same Pell Grant recipients. I think 25 or 30 percent of them go on to borrow money from this program, and also middle income families who are feeling the financial strain of having one kid or two or three kids in college at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We estimate that the savings over the life of that loan will be above $4,000, almost $4,500 for those individuals. That is a very substantial savings, and it is what we know that the young people calculate what is going to be the cost of college, and that includes the interest rates that they are going to have to pay back. As we know, there is forbearance against the payment of interest rates while the students are in college, but upon graduation, they start paying that money back, and that interest  rate is a significant cost for those students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also try to make sure that those individuals who have chosen to go into public service can understand that there will be some relief for their efforts through a loan forgiveness program for policemen, firemen, teachers, teachers of special ed, prosecutors, public defenders, all of whom enter professions that don't have the highest economic rewards at the outset, but we want them to go into those professions as services to our communities. And we want to make sure that they do so so we can  continue to hold civil society together in this country and receive the benefits of their work and they will not be so burdened by the loans that they will choose to go elsewhere and leave society without the use of their talents, as I say, in health care, law enforcement, education, and so many other fields that are important to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And following on the passage of the COMPETES Act, we provide for highly qualified teachers in every classroom. In the TEACH Act, we recognize the importance of highly skilled math and science teachers, and we identify those people who are performing in an exemplary fashion in college and offer them tuition assistance if they go into teaching math and science and go into those schools in high need. That would provide $4,000 in up-front tuition assistance for those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also make landmark investments of $500 million in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges, and Alaska/Hawaiian Native colleges. We have a problem of fully qualified minority students going to some of these colleges and really not being able to stay for a host of reasons. We have had discussions with the heads of State college systems and university systems and others about this problem, and the fact of the matter is we have to do more to  support those students so they can successfully negotiate the college education that they seek to pursue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this legislation is comprehensive. It is important. We did it by taking away the excessive subsidies to the student lending agencies, subsidies that were identified as excessive a number of years ago in the President's budget and by the OMB, and we recycled those successive savings to the benefit of the students and their families who once again are going into great financial stress to make sure that their children will have an opportunity at a college education that we recognize is so important  in terms of their future ability to fully participate in the American economy, the American society, and to provide for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As we pointed out, this legislation is the largest commitment of Federal resources since the GI Bill of 1944. We think it's important. We would hope to have an affirmative vote to go to conference on the motion to instruct, and then we could proceed with the conference in the coming days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague. I thank you for the support on this motion to instruct, and with that, I would also then like to yield 4 minutes to my colleague from Utah (Mr. Bishop).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, allow me rhetorically, if I can, just to concentrate on one issue, the one at hand, which is the significant proposal, the motion to instruct made by the gentleman from Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Armed Services Committee, as well as the Education Committee, I strongly support this extremely important motion that has been given to us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the day in July when my State celebrates the arrival of the pioneers into Salt Lake Valley, in a remote Pakistani town, the Pakistani police were closing in on one house that had been given as an intelligence tip that the top Taliban leader was inside. According to the Washington Post, this Taliban leader, Abdullah Mehsud, if I have pronounced that properly, was a short, round man in his early thirties, who had been an active Taliban commander in Pakistan for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amazingly, though, this same man had been among the first military detainees at Guantanamo and had been released in 2004. Upon his release, what did he do? Go back to Pakistan, once again working with the Taliban, helping al Qaeda infiltrators coming into the rugged mountains area of Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But on this fateful day back in July, with the Pakistani police closing in, this top Taliban leader, who only the year before had been leading terrorist activities against mosques, had kidnapped a couple of Chinese engineers, and who knows what else, pulled the pin on a hand grenade and blew himself up rather than resubmit to the authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's memorable and reminds one of the extravagances that took place in March of 2004 in Madrid when the subway bombings killed 200, injured 2,000 people. This al Qaeda-inspired terrorist activity and the leaders of that were tracked down by Spanish authorities; and as they surrounded the apartment where they were, the terrorists, the al Qaeda terrorists, had preplanned their own self-martyrdom by having wired their own apartment. So as the police closed in upon them, they pushed the button, not  only blowing themselves up but also almost imploding the entire building, which would have killed hundreds of other innocent victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the reason, Mr. Speaker, that I present these two anecdotal stories is simply this: these people are not nice people. They're murderers of the worst sort. They're ideologically driven to kill. They would stop at nothing to try and kill as many men, women and children, if possible, in their goals of maximizing the amount of pain and destruction, especially those relating to us. They do not belong on American soil, nor do they belong to be released back to their own countries, where they can  reorganize again, in this war, not just again on terror, but also the war against civilization and basic humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion to instruct asks this conference to accept the language passed in a similar bill in the Senate on an overwhelming 94-3 vote that rejects transferring a terrorist detained in Guantanamo to the United States soil. Our penal system, as we envision it, is one of rehabilitation. Obviously, these people have not been rehabilitated; and as we discuss what we will do as our options, as we discuss any kind of closure that may take place in Guantanamo, we should obviously say which options are  not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moving any of these prisoners to the United States is simply not acceptable. Returning them to their homes is simply not acceptable. Destroying the intelligence value we have at Guantanamo is simply not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This sense of the Congress resolution simply is one of those things that this body, the people's body, the House of Representatives, should overwhelmingly support. I cannot imagine anyone honestly believing it is a good idea to close Guantanamo and bring these individuals into our neighborhoods and into our backyards, nor to release them back to their country of origin where they'd be free to reorganize themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. McConnell said on the floor today, this is not a motion simply for the status quo. Flexibility of what our choices will be would still be allowed, but it does clearly say that the one option that is not acceptable would be a closing of Guantanamo Bay with the only option being of removing these people and bringing them back into our neighborhoods, back into our homes and back on American soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that, I appreciate what the gentleman from Michigan has done in bringing this once again to our attention so that we can join the Senate in  making sure that this is very clear of what is not our policy option.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I just want to point out for a number of Members who have asked about what's the relationship of this reconciliation to the loan scandals that the Nation was witness to earlier this year, this legislation does not contain the language of the Sunshine Act that we passed overwhelmingly in May of this year. That will be contained in the Higher Education Act that the House and Senate plan to do soon. It's in the Senate bill, and we have passed the Sunshine Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members will recall, this was legislation that falls on the heels of public reports of colleges and lenders and their relationships between colleges and lenders and special relationships that were developed in some cases for the exchange of gifts, financial favors, holidays, special treatment to people working for the colleges that were steering people to a particular lender for their loans. Whether or not that was in the best interest of the student or not really didn't come into play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These practices have gone on for a considerable period of time. In some cases, they've been brought to the attention of the Department of Education by the Inspector General. They were not properly dealt with, and the Attorney General of the State of New York, Mr. Cuomo, brought them to the Nation's attention with his investigation of some of the large lending institutions and these practices and entered into a number of consent agreements with those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had hearings on this matter and the failure of oversight by both the Congress and the Department, and we passed the Sunshine Act in reaction to those hearings that we had, again, and was passed on a strong bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think these two things are connected. The terms are now removing the excessive subsidies that were used in many instances to grease these relationships for the benefit of the lenders and not for the benefit of the students and of their families who are borrowing the money to pay for their college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just wanted to bring the Members up to snuff on that matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Senate rejected transferring al Qaeda terrorists from Gitmo to our homeland. That was a wise decision. That is a decision that my colleagues here in the House should support tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gitmo is a facility that is working. It's working in many different ways. It's keeping terrorists, these terrorists, away from the homeland. It's providing us with an opportunity to get the information that may be necessary and may be helpful in keeping America safe. When the Senate acted, they acted overwhelmingly, 94-3, to say make sure that these individuals do not come to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides us with the alternatives and the flexibility that, as we move forward in defeating radical jihadists, that we will have the strategies in place to keep us safe, to get the information that we need, provide us with the background to implement the correct strategies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are safer keeping these terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 528 miles away from the homeland. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this motion to instruct conferees. It is a good motion. It's a good decision, a good direction that was put forward by the Members of the other body; and I hope that we stand with them tonight.</paragraph>
