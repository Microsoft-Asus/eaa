    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are many heroes fighting the global war against terrorists, and many from the Eighth District of North Carolina. But today I rise to pay tribute to one hero  in particular. Today I am proud to recognize Air Force Staff Sergeant Richard Rose, son of Robyn Rose of Laurinburg, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Rose, a member of the 1st Combat Camera Squadron at Charleston Air Force Base, served as a Joint Combat Camera photographer with the Multinational Division in Baghdad from May 18 to September 18 of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this time, Sergeant Rose was attached to several Army units, documenting their daily missions and contributing over 1,000 images of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Rose primarily shoots with his camera lens, but that changed last summer. During a mission with the 101st Airborne Division Air Assault Unit, insurgents began firing at an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team which was clearing roadside bombs nearby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard quickly responded by returning fire with his M4 rifle, which allowed the Explosive Ordnance Team to move to safety. His efforts are credited with helping to save the lives of 56 servicemembers during the attack, and his bravery in this firefight earned him the Bronze Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that you join me in congratulating Sergeant Richard Rose on being awarded the Bronze Star in defending our Nation in the war against terrorists. Pray for their safety, and pray for victory against these terrorists.</paragraph>
