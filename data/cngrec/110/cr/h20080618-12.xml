  <narrative>MISTAKES MADE IN AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5486]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week it was revealed that the Air Force made a serious mistake in comparing the costs of tanker aircraft proposals offered by Northrop Grumman/Airbus and Boeing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Air Force awarded this $40 billion contract to Northrop Grumman/Airbus, it repeatedly said that the cost of the two planes was one of their top selection criteria. However this latest revelation, supported by both companies, undercuts the Air Force's assertion that they picked the most cost-effective aircraft and casts doubt on whether the two planes were evaluated fairly on the other criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take, for example, fuel usage. The Airbus tanker uses 24 percent more fuel than Boeing, about 400 gallons more per hour, and over 2 billion gallons of fuel each year. Yet the Air Force continues to claim that the Airbus tanker is the best value over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time of soaring fuel costs that calls into question whether the most cost-effective choice was made for our taxpayers and our airmen for a plane with a lifespan of 40 years, the selection of tanker aircraft will have far-reaching implications for our Nation's industrial base and our security. The Air Force must get it right and rebid this critical decision.</paragraph>
