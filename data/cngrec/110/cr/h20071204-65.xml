  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the subject of our Special Order this evening is our dear friend, Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would yield to Congressman Rohrabacher from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we remember the life of Henry Hyde. Henry Hyde was no doubt one of the greatest Members ever to serve in this Chamber. He was certainly one of the most articulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me note right off the beginning, Henry Hyde was a personal hero of mine long before I arrived here in this body in 1989. And unlike heroes who I have met over my lifetime, quite often I have been disappointed in the heroes that I have met, Henry Hyde remained a person I admired, a hero that I admired, even after I got to work with him and got to know him personally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was, yes, a great orator, and he had a personal presence. Anyone who has ever worked or been around Henry Hyde could tell you that. Yet, these were not the qualities that made his greatness. Henry used his talents and his influence to further fundamental principles and values that reflected Henry's character and his commitment to higher ideals. He rose above politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is it that Henry believed in? What were these higher ideals? Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Life. Yes, that is the first, that is the first of Henry's values. Yes, Henry was one of the greatest voices in the defense of the unborn on this planet. It was not the popular stand to take, and it still is not necessarily the popular stand to take. It was a moral imperative, however, a moral imperative that Henry felt very deeply about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When someone believes that the issue of abortion is not an issue that concerns tissue being extracted from a woman's body, but is instead an issue that deals with the ending of a human life, the principle is clear. But the courage to advocate such a moral and principled position may not match the importance of the issue itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry spoke with such eloquence on so many issues, but on this issue, one could not help but admire him and know that it was something that was coming from his heart, and a heart that was filled with love. He was a national force in the battle to protect the unborn. This is part of his legacy and something we should not forget and we should always remember him for, because it took courage for him to lead this battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry made this issue a crusade, and he did much himself to create the movement that now I think has brought public opinion and at least the public consciousness more to what the issue is on this issue of abortion. Yes, life was Henry's number one priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Liberty. Henry fought for liberty as a young naval officer in the Philippines during the Second World War. I was very honored to have gone with Henry to the Philippines where he was issued a medal for his service as a young man in the Second World War. He then after the war returned home and fought the battle for liberty in both the State legislature in Illinois, and, yes, here in the halls of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry's war was a war for liberty and justice for all. Henry was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And, yes, we should not forget another controversial thing about Henry. He led that Judiciary Committee at a time of an impeachment procedure against President Bill Clinton. With the sexual implications of the charges against the former President, that endeavor could have turned into a lurid political circus. Instead, Henry Hyde insisted on maintaining standards and maintaining that the issue  was perjury, and that was the only issue to be approached and discussed, and he insisted on maintaining the decorum of this House under these most trying of circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving as chairman the Judiciary Committee, he moved on to serve as chairman of the International Relations Committee. I was honored to serve with him on that august committee, and I watched firsthand as he stepped up and he maintained his commitment not only to American security, but to human liberty. These were the paramount issues for Henry Hyde, whether our country was safe and whether human liberty was being furthered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, Henry Hyde was the chairman of the International Relations Committee and led us after 9/11, led us at a time when we went into war with radical Islam, a war in which we are currently engaged. And Henry, his courage, his strength, his character, did very much to ensure the American people that, yes, we will prevail over this monstrous evil enemy that we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, finally let me note the pursuit of happiness. All of us who knew Henry know that he was a man who enjoyed  his life. He exemplified that happiness comes from more than just acquiring material wealth. Henry was a happy man because he was doing what he thought was right and was making a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he left us last year, he had dedicated his whole life to the service of our country and to those higher ideals I have just mentioned. He had every reason to be proud of the wonderful and exemplary life that he had lived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, tonight we remember Henry. He will be buried later on this week, but he will remain a force in this body and will remain a force in American politics for years to come, along with the Henry Clays and the Daniel Websters and the other great orators and great men of principle who have served here in Washington in the People's House and in this great Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Ray LaHood.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to one of the finest public servants that I have ever known, Congressman Henry Hyde. Henry passed away last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I begin my own remarks, I want to offer a couple of comments on behalf of Congressman JESSE JACKSON, Jr., who for family reasons is not able to be here, but asked me to offer these remarks on his behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a good friend of Congressman Hyde, someone from the other side of the aisle, but someone from our Illinois delegation. He wanted me to express his feelings that Henry was not only a good friend to him, but he was a great American; someone who loved America and someone who really made the world a better place; someone who Congressman JESSE JACKSON, Jr., called a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer those remarks on behalf of Congressman JESSE JACKSON, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry made a difference. When I was asked by a reporter recently what I will remember about him, what I said was that many of us come to this place with the idea that we can make a difference. Henry Hyde made a difference. He made a difference in the lives of the people that he represented, not just in his congressional district and not just in Illinois, but in the country and in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He distinguished himself by serving as Chair of two committees, the Judiciary Committee and the International Relations Committee, during deliberations of some very, very serious legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde had the ability to change people's minds. That is almost unheard of around here. People come to the well of the House almost always knowing how they are going to vote on a particular bill. But whether it was the flag amendment, whether it was term limits, which was a part of the Contract with America in 1995, whether it was the Hyde amendment, which protected so many lives for so many unborn, whether it was impeachment or whether it was expansion of O'Hare Airport, Henry Hyde had the  ability to come to this floor and persuade his colleagues of his point of view. He had a very, very uncanny ability to do that, because of his intelligence, because of the way that he presented himself, and because of the respect that the Members of this body had for this great man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did make a difference, and he did it with the highest level of civility and dignity. He brought great honor, great dignity to this institution, by his presence, the way he conducted his arguments on the great debates of the day, and I have no doubt that people did change their votes and change their minds. Particularly on term limits he made some very compelling arguments, and particularly on the flag amendment he made some very compelling arguments, and over a long period of 30 years, three  decades, on the Hyde amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And even though the impeachment proceedings were very controversial, people respected the way Henry Hyde conducted those proceedings as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in a very honorable way and a very civil way. And even those on the other side who did not agree with the impeachment proceedings, they agreed that Henry Hyde conducted it with the highest level of honesty, integrity and civility that you can bring to this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every third Thursday of each month that we are in session, our delegation which now numbers 21, counting our two U.S. Senators, 19 Members and 2 U.S. Senators, have lunch together. We used to gather in Speaker Hastert's office, and now we gather in Senator Durbin's office. And before every delegation lunch, we could always count on Henry Hyde to tell at least one or two very, very funny stories. He was a great storyteller and he loved to tell stories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget almost a year ago when Henry would come in the Chamber as we were departing for the final votes, and he was in a wheelchair because of his back problems, and announced to all of us over in that part of the Chamber that just a few weeks before that, about a year ago, he wed his chief of staff of 35 years and he was very, very happy. They were going to move back to Geneva, Illinois, which is a suburban part of Chicago, west of Chicago, and they were going to live happily ever  after in Geneva, Illinois, which is a beautiful part of the world on the Fox River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Bush announced that he was going to give Henry Hyde the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I tried to call Henry and was not able to reach him. I did send him a note. I know how proud he was. Of all of the awards and accolades that he received, I know he was proudest of his Presidential Medal of Freedom because it is the highest civilian award that the President of the United States can give to any person, and I know how proud Henry was of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a Member from Illinois who has served with Henry now during my 13 years and as former chief of staff to Bob Michel, it is difficult to think that Henry Hyde is gone. But he will be long remembered for his civility, the dignity, the high honor that he brought to the job and to the debates of very controversial issues, and was still able to maintain the collegiality of every Member of this body, both Democrats and Republicans, a great lesson for all of us and a great example for all of us  of how we should treat one another and how we should conduct the debates, even when there are great differences and great opportunities for divide on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry stands as a lasting example. He will be remembered that you can make a difference on important issues and during debate. We honor his memory tonight which will be long remembered throughout the history of the House of Representatives. Godspeed, Henry Hyde.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague, Don Manzullo, for putting this together tonight. It is great to listen to my friend and colleague, RAY LAHOOD, and follow Dana Rohrabacher. I think you will see a lot of Members speak tonight, and they will say a lot of similar things. We have colleagues from Texas, Ohio and New Jersey here, which shows the width, breadth and the reach of Chairman Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you come to this institution as a new Member, there are people who are national figures and many people learn to become friends with them in different ways. I think one of the great privileges is when you become a colleague of one of these great figures of history, and as Dana Rohrabacher said, he meets the requirements of what you would expect and the person that you have idolized and respected over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I follow RAY LAHOOD who mentioned our bipartisan luncheon. We would also get together as a Republican delegation every now and then, and at that time we had the Speaker. Before the Speaker would weigh in, he would always turn to the dean of the Illinois delegation seeking Henry Hyde's counsel, his wisdom, his experience, and his expertise. I think that is a sign of a great leader when you know who to go to; and, of course, with the great respect we had for the wisdom and the conviction  of Chairman Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Henry spoke, people really did listen. That is a lot to be said because we speak a lot and a lot of times people aren't listened to. But Henry Hyde did it, and for many of the reasons that Ray mentioned, but I think because of the great respect that people from both sides of the aisle had for Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all have our own little stories to tell. I am an individual who struggled personally with the term limits debate. Chairman Hyde would just always respectfully beat the heck out of me because of my stated position. He said, John, we have term limits; they are called elections. When people talk about Henry's strong speeches on the floor about term limits, they would think he was for term limits, but Henry was adamantly opposed to term limits because he was a constitutionalist at heart.  He said the Constitution allows for term limits, and that is why we go before the voters every 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After wearing me down for many, many years, I eventually moved to the Henry Hyde position on term limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that is the type of person he was, not out of a view of political expediency or what is right for the public political perception at the time, but what was right for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of colleagues down here so I am not going to belabor the point. Dana Rohrabacher said it right. I think the great way to remember Henry Hyde is to remember life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Life in the Hyde amendment. You can say these simply, clearly and they identify Chairman Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, life would be the Hyde amendment. Liberty, aid to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua and Central America and the fight against the nuclear freeze movement. Chairman Hyde, that was liberty making the hard decisions against political expediency to promote democracy and freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the pursuit of happiness, the Millennium Challenge. It is not just the pursuit of happiness for the country, it is the pursuit of happiness for the whole world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to be able to be on the floor to take a few minutes to thank Chairman Hyde for his friendship, his mentorship. He is and will be missed. God bless you, Henry Hyde.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I recognized the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to associate myself with the sense of loss we all feel for the passing of Congressman Henry Hyde. As I think my colleagues know, Henry Hyde was one of the rarest, most accomplished and most distinguished Members of Congress ever to serve. He was a class act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was a man of deep and abiding faith, generous to a fault with an incisive mind that worked seamlessly with his incredible sense of humor. He was a friend and colleague who inspired and challenged us to look beyond surface appeal arguments and to take seriously the admonitions of Holy Scripture to care for the downtrodden, the vulnerable and the least of our brethren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the greatest human rights issue of our time, the right to life for unborn children, the disabled and frail elderly, Henry Hyde will always be known as the great champion and the great defender of life. No one was more logical, compassionate or eloquent in the defense of the disenfranchised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the Hyde amendment, countless young children and adults walk on this Earth today and have an opportunity to love, to learn, to experience, to play sports, to get married, to enjoy their grandchildren some day, to experience the adventure of life itself because they were spared destruction when they were most at risk, millions, almost all of whom have no idea how much danger they were in, today pursue their dreams and their hopes with expectations and great accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With malice towards none, no one, even his most vociferous critics, Henry Hyde often took to the House floor to politely ask us to show compassion and respect and even love for the innocent and inconvenient babies about to be annihilated by abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Congressman for 32 years, a chairman for 6 years of the Judiciary Committee, and for another 6 years chairman of the International Relations Committee, Henry Hyde was a prodigious lawmaker. With uncanny skill, determination and grace, he crafted numerous historic bipartisan laws and commonsense policies that lifted people out of poverty, helped alleviate disease, strengthen the U.S. Code to protect victims and to get the criminals off the streets. He was magnificent in his defense of democracy  and freedom both here and overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of his many legislative accomplishments includes his authorship of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, a 5-year $15 billion plan to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. During the debate, Chairman Hyde compared the HIV/AIDS crisis to the bubonic plague of the 14th century, the black death, and challenged us to enact a comprehensive program to rescue the sick, assist the dying and to prevent the contagion from spreading.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having served with this brilliant one-of-a-kind lawmaker, I know the world will truly miss Henry Hyde. Still, we take some comfort in knowing that Henry Hyde's kindness, his compassion and generosity will live on in the many laws he wrote to protect and enhance the lives of others. I, we, will miss this great statesman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. I must admit I feel most inadequate to the task to find words to somehow adequately eulogize this great man, this colleague, this friend of ours whom we called Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess the most important thing I can say about him in the time that I have served in Congress, I can think of no greater champion of human life and human freedom than Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think about the Hyde amendment and what that means to human life, that accomplishment alone is worthy of an entire Congress, and it is really the work of one United States Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tens of thousands live today because of Henry Hyde. There can be no doubt about that, Mr. Speaker. And often in debate we hear people come to the floor and talk about we need to pass this legislation or that legislation because we need to do it for the least of these. He, more than any other, understood in the depths of his heart that the least of these are the unborn. And because of that, he was a champion. And we do properly eulogize him tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, in debate, Mr. Speaker, it can get quite contentious. One wonders sometimes why a civil society cannot have a civil Congress. But I have no doubt that although many occasionally may have thought him wrong headed, no one in this institution ever thought he was wrong hearted because he always acted out of the purest of motives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And as I hearken back to a comment that the gentleman from Illinois made before me, it is interesting to note that Henry Hyde was one of the few Members of Congress that each of us would come to this floor and actually have a greater interest in listening to him than listening to ourselves. Very few Members of this body, Mr. Speaker, command that kind of attention. But when Henry Hyde spoke, people wanted to listen because he brought the force of his intellect, he brought his humor, he brought  his grace, his kindness, he brought his civility, and he brought his humility to this floor. And because of it, Mr. Speaker, I know that I am a better person and I believe that every other Member of this institution is also better for having known Henry Hyde and being able to listen to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We regret his loss, but we thank his family. And I am well acquainted with his son Bob, who is a resident of Dallas, as I am, and I just want to thank them for loaning him to this great institution and this great country. And, again, I know I am a better Member of Congress and a better human being because I had an opportunity to meet Henry Hyde. And I know that as he meets his Creator, there is no doubt in my mind, Mr. Speaker, that he has heard those words, "Well done, good and faithful servant."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentlelady from Ohio (Mrs. Schmidt) for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I formally recognize her, I noted with great interest that when Mrs. Schmidt was elected to Congress in that special election, I don't think there was a time that I came in when Henry wasn't here that Congresswoman Schmidt wasn't seated right next to him talking to him, listening to him, and observing his spirit. And it is most appropriate that she speak about this  great American this evening. I recognize JEAN SCHMIDT.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Last week, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former Congressman Henry Hyde. The United States lost a great statesman. I lost a role model and a valued friend. We all lost a man who exemplified civility and led a life dedicated to his country, serving others and his ideals. His story should serve as a beacon of hope for all who knew of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Hyde came from humble roots. He earned a basketball scholarship to college, fought in World War II, and earned a law degree. He was the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Hyde was first elected to Congress in 1975. As a stalwart in Congress for nearly 3 decades, it was his voice of civility and passion which Members from both sides of the aisle respected and appreciated and which he is oftentimes remembered for the most. But he is most often remembered by all for the Hyde Amendment, legislation to prohibit the use of Federal taxpayer dollars for abortions in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his years in Congress, he not only worked to protect the lives of the unborn, but he also was active in the United States and Russian relations during the Cold War, wrote legislation to address worldwide AIDS epidemic, and presided over the House impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most will remember Henry Hyde for all that he was able to accomplish as a Member of Congress. I will remember him as a man who was true to his ideals and who spoke to our hopes, not our fears.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His legislative accomplishments were just a reflection of who he was. His compassion for the unborn and the weak and the forgotten was not simply a veneer pasted on for public consumption. He understood the meaning of life and championed laws to protect it from its natural conception to its natural death. He treated everyone he met as if he or she were the most important person in the world because he saw them as God's children and knew that they were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Hyde was truly a life well lived. The country and the world have experienced a great loss. I have lost a dear friend on this floor. My condolences go out to his entire family. I truly feel privileged to have served with such a great man. And I would like to add that, when I was elected, I was excited to meet here, but I was most excited to meet Congressman Hyde. May he rest in peace in the Lord's arms.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a real honor to rise and speak of the life of a great American statesman and a true friend of the American people and a personal friend, Congressman Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I arrived here in the Congress in 1993, Henry Hyde was already legendary. He had many years before that begun work on the Hyde Amendment, which established for now some 30-plus years the principle that the American taxpayers' dollars would not be used to fund abortions. That principle has stood with us all these years and I believe will stand with us well beyond Congressman Hyde's passing. It was a great legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Congressman Hyde was known as an outstanding orator, a public speaker of the first order. He brought both his keen intellect and sharp wit with his heart to the speeches that he gave on this floor, and he commanded the attention of his colleagues and often changed the minds of people who might have been very much hardened against the position that he was putting forward. He did it with considerable skill, with considerable intellect, and with considerable commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I arrived in 1993, I became very much aware of his personal attention that he gave to other Members of this House. As a new Member, he helped me through one of the more difficult committees to serve on in the Congress, the Judiciary Committee. And when we gained the majority, the Republican majority in 1994, the Republican leadership recognized Henry Hyde's capabilities and actually passed him over other Members of the Congress to make him chairman of that committee, knowing that that committee  had an enormous task ahead of it because, as many will recall, in 1994, Republican Members campaigned for election on the Contract for America. What many may not realize is that of the nearly 30 bills that comprised the 10 principles that made up the Contract for America, more than half of them went through the Judiciary Committee, and Congressman Hyde shepherded each one of those through the committee and then across the floor of the House, and many subsequently</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His greatest challenge may have come with the impeachment of President Clinton. And I served on the committee with him during that very difficult time as well. The impeachment of the President of the United States is one of the more serious things that the Congress has to deal with, and it is certainly something that can evoke great emotions and can bring about great contention in the committee. But Chairman Hyde managed the committee with great fairness, with great attention to detail, and did  so at a time when he was personally vilified and attacked in a number of different ways, most unfairly, and yet did it with equanimity, with grace, and I think commanded the respect of Members on both sides of the aisle as he handled that very, very difficult challenge, and did so, I might</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was an individual who believed very, very deeply in our Constitution, and he showed that through his hard, hard work for 6 years as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in passing a multitude of pieces of legislation that showed that great respect for our Constitution. But he was more than simply a believer in the rule of law. He was a believer in the human heart. And he showed that time and time again in his work with other Members of this Congress, as we have heard some mentioned  here this evening, and also in his work internationally; because after he completed his work as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he was given another important and great challenge of serving as chairman of the International Relations Committee. And I have had the opportunity to see him in action with Presidents and Prime Ministers, to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have not had the privilege of serving on the International Relations Committee, but I have had the opportunity to serve for 14 years on the Judiciary Committee with Congressman Hyde, and I will never forget the leadership that he provided on that committee and in this Congress. He has been an inspiration to me, he has been an inspiration to millions of other Americans, and he deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest statesmen of our time. And I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the Congressman from Arizona, TRENT FRANKS, 10 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400141" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Congressman Manzullo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was perhaps more responsible than any other Member of this body for allowing me to become a Member of Congress, and I stand here thanking him for his work and for him allowing me to come to this place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our moment in history is marked by mortal conflict between a culture of life and a culture of death.  God put us in this world to do noble things, to love and to cherish our fellow human beings, not to destroy them. Today, we must choose sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, those words were spoken by one Henry Hyde, who in 1924 was born in the same State that once gave us an Abraham Lincoln who guided America through that terrible storm that brought about the end of a cancer called slavery that it had embedded itself so deeply in American policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That same greatness of spirit that compelled Abraham Lincoln to remind our Nation that all men are created equal also compelled Henry Hyde to spend 32 years of his life serving this body in defense of that same truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Henry Hyde said, "We are the heirs of 1776, and of an epic moment in history of human affairs when the Founders of this Republic pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. Think of that, their sacred honor, to the defense of the rule of law. The rule of law is to safeguard our liberties. The rule of law is what allows us to live in our freedom in ways that honor the freedom of others."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, whether working to overturn the horrors of child sex slavery, of sex trafficking, or advocating to protect victims of human rights abuse, or improving the lives of children, families, seniors, and military veterans, or protecting the innocent from the threat of terrorism, or striving to bring clean water and basic sanitation to the poorest of the poor all over the world, Henry Hyde was truly a man who gave himself to the cause of honoring and protecting the equal, inherent, and profound  dignity of every member of the human family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He carried himself with such honor and dignity and true nobility, and yet never wavered in the strength or perseverance of his convictions. Like President Ronald Reagan, he carried a reputation for being a happy warrior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, while the hallmark of Henry Hyde's life was the compassion for all of humanity, the driving force of his work in Congress was the dedication to protecting and restoring the constitutional rights for an entirely unprotected class of humanity he called the "defenseless unborn."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was instrumental in crafting legislation such as the Mexico City policy and the partial birth abortion ban. Perhaps his most world-changing initiative came in the form of the legendary Hyde amendment which passed 2 years after he first came to Washington in 1976. It prohibited the practice of taxpayers being forced to pay for abortions. The year before, taxpayer funds had provided for more than 300,000 abortions in America. Mr. Speaker, at the very least, over 1 million little souls  have lived to feel the warmth of sunlight and freedom on their faces because of the Hyde amendment and the work of Henry Hyde, and that number could well be in the millions. That is a legacy no words of mine can ever express.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Henry Hyde once said, "This is not a debate about religious doctrine or even about public policy options. It is a debate about our understanding of human dignity, what it means to be a member of the human family, even though tiny, powerless and unwanted."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was a man of unwavering principle, an unflinching patriot who never hesitated to confront even the fiercest controversies once he believed that he was fighting on the side of truth, God, and human freedom. Not only did he fight tirelessly for those truths, he spoke them so powerfully that he deeply and profoundly moved the heart of America. He stirred this body on countless occasions and helped to rekindle the conscience of this Nation, and the legacy of his words will resonate long  after every one of us has walked out of that Chamber for the very last time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, Mr. Speaker, Congressman Henry Hyde was honored by the President of the United States with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award that can be bestowed on any civilian. "He used his persuasive powers for noble causes" according to the President. "He was a gallant champion of the weak and the forgotten, and a fearless defender of life in all of his seasons."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, back in 1857 in the Dred Scott decision, the Supreme Court said that the black man was not a person under the Constitution, and it took a civil war to reverse that tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the rise of the Nazi Holocaust, we saw the German high tribunal say that Jews were unworthy of being classed as humans, and a tragedy that beggars our understanding followed as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then in 1973 we saw the Supreme Court of the United States of America take from the innocent unborn children the most basic human right of all, the right to live. And in all three cases, Mr. Speaker, a great human tragedy followed. The Civil War took more lives than any war in our history. The world war that arrested the Nazi Holocaust took 50 million lives worldwide, and even saw atomic bombs fall on cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And today we stand in retrospect and wonder how the compassion of humanity did not rise in defense of those who could not defend themselves when such horrible atrocities might have been prevented. And yet, there and here, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, we have killed 50 million of our own children in what should have been the safe sanctuary of their own mother's wombs. They died nameless and alone, their mothers were never the same, Mr. Speaker, and all of the gifts those  children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no way for me to add to the power of the immortal words of that gallant statesman, Henry Hyde himself. He said something I wish that every American, every person on Earth could hear. He said, "When the time comes, as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates. You are there standing alone before God, and a terror will rip through your soul  like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there will be a chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world, but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world. And they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, spare him because he loved us. And God will look at you and say, not did you succeed, but did you try?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Henry Hyde truly tried. And I am convinced that the day will still come in America when the warm sunlight of life will finally break through these clouds and shine once again on the faces of unborn children in this Nation. And when that day comes, history will record that it is a great champion named Henry Hyde who waged a quiet war for the defenseless unborn in the Halls of this Congress. And he reached up to hold the hand of an unseen God and reached down to hold the hand of an  unnamed little baby and refused to let go until the storm was gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, if I'm wrong, and somehow America never finds its way out of this horrible darkness of abortion on demand, I know more than anything else in the world that the Lord of the universe still hears the cries of every last one of his children. And no matter who or where they are, if time turns every star in heaven to ashes, I know in my soul, as Henry Hyde knew in his, that that eternal moment of God's deliverance will come to every last one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Henry Hyde was a true and noble champion and he will live forever in our hearts and minds as a warrior for the cause of human freedom and human life. May his family, his many friends, and loved ones be comforted in the peace and assurance of knowing that their courageous father and husband and friend has been welcomed by an eternal chorus of voices and has now walked safely into the arms of God and heard him whisper, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless Henry Hyde.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the remaining time that we have.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has approximately 20 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Okay. I'll claim 5 minutes for myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was elected to this Congress in 1992, was sworn in in 1993, and never got used to the name Congressman. When someone said Congressman, I would turn around and I'd look for Henry  Hyde. I thought that you had to be here an unnamed number of years and garner the utmost respect of your colleagues before you could be called by that name, Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I had the opportunity to work with Henry. I recall in either 1993 or 1994, when it was going to be very difficult because of some procedural problem for Henry Hyde to offer the Hyde amendment, and the only way that he could do that was through unanimous consent of this body. It was on I believe an appropriations bill. I sat next to Henry Hyde at this table to my immediate right, and he turned to me and he said, Don, if I can't offer this amendment, tens of thousands of children will die.  And I was numbed by what he said, and also by the immense power that one person could have to intervene in the lives of those who had not, who could not see the light of day because of their circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, William Natcher, from Mississippi stood up in a very noisy Chamber, and he said, I ask unanimous consent in this body that the Hyde amendment be allowed in order. And I remember him peering over those glasses, this man from Mississippi who never missed a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives. One person could have said, I object, and no one did. And Henry Hyde offered the amendment that particular afternoon and it passed this body and  went on to become part of the continuing law forbidding the use of taxpayers' funding for abortions. I shall never forget the sweat that was emanating from his body, how his hands were being wrung together. And I never thought it possible that one person could make that much of a difference in the United States Congress. And he made the difference to people who could never vote for him. He just did it because he said that this is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there were other occasions in my career as a Member of Congress where I would see him stand up. And when Henry Hyde stood up to speak, this noisy body of 435 independent contractors would become very quiet and listen to Henry Hyde. When the Contract with America was penned, and he handled several bills dealing with that very difficult piece of, series of legislation, in the section on product liability he allowed me to give the concluding speech on the floor because one of the companies that  I represent back in Rockford, Illinois, had gone out of business on the 100th anniversary because it was sued over a machine that it had manufactured 50 years earlier. And sitting on the desk of the president of that great company was a summons starting a suit over a machine that was manufactured at the time of the House of Romanov when it ruled Russia. And he gave me the honor of giving the concluding speech on that very difficult topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You ask yourselves, where are the Henry Hydes of America today? Where are the orators of this House? And no one stands up because they're gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would recognize the gentleman from Illinois, PETER ROSKAM, for as much time as he would consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, as I've sat and listened this evening to the tributes of Congressman Hyde, a couple of things have become clear to me, that there's an element, a great sense of loss tonight among us about a man that people on both sides of the aisle really came to respect and admire and deeply appreciate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I've thought about Congressman Hyde and the role that he played, he came to Congress in 1974, that was a very difficult time for the Republican Party. He's one of the few people that was successful in a campaign after the scandal of Watergate, and came in and in a way Henry Hyde was a conservative in the House of Representatives before conservative was cool. He was passionate about a strong America and understanding fundamentally what our Nation's role was in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've talked a lot over the past several minutes about Henry Hyde and his pro-life legacy. There was another passion that he had, and I think it was inextricably linked to his view of life and defending it at all ages, and that was his high view of freedom. He was a person who understood fundamentally that the United States had a very special role to play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a staffer for him and remember him talking about the captive nations. That was a phrase that was used to capture the description of the Eastern Bloc nations. And you see, in Henry Hyde's district, in the Sixth District of Illinois, there were a whole host of immigrants, folks who had come to this land of America because America was free. And Henry Hyde represented that constituency well. And it was a people that had been formed largely by their suffering under a tyrannical communist regime.  And when Henry Hyde came to office in 1974, in those years before the 1980 election, he was among a small group of people in the House, I think, that really understood what was at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Turned out Ronald Reagan won a historic election in 1980. It was a land slide really of epic proportion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And Henry Hyde was one of those people that was positioned in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, to be one of Ronald Reagan's partners over the next 8 years on what has been nothing short of a transformation of American foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde was a pivotal figure in the mid-1980s when the House turned to him and asked him to play a key role at the time in the Iran-Contra investigation. And I remember working for him at that time and a whole great deal of activity. And when I was looking at my boss, Congressman Hyde, during the committee hearings, every time he asked a question, every time he made a point, there was a sense of clarity about him that was just very, very inviting. He understood what was going on. He didn't  shy away from a political fight, as we all know, but he had this way about him that was a way to engage people in such a way that he was able to persuade them. He was sort of the old school of American politics in that he wasn't satisfied merely to have a debate. No. This was a guy who wanted to persuade</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen, he was at a pivotal point in our public life together in very difficult times for our country. But we all know, as we reflect on this great man, that he did it with a sense of duty, he did it with a sense of honor, and he did it in a way that he always upheld his oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember the first time I met Henry Hyde, I was interviewing in his office, and it was when he was in the Rayburn building, room 2104 in the Rayburn building. It was, I think, an April evening, if I'm not mistaken, in the mid-1980s, and I had a chance to interview with my own congressman, Henry Hyde, to become possibly a legislative assistant. I went in. I handed him my resume. And I have an independent recollection, as I am standing here today, of Henry Hyde looking out over me in these half  glasses and kind of clearing his throat looking at the resume, sort of looking it over, and I remember feeling very intimidated because at the time, after all, I was in a conversation with Henry Hyde. Well, to make a long story short, he very graciously offered me the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what I will say is this. We serve with a whole cast of characters here in Congress. And we see one another many times on the floor, and we interact with one another, and we see one another in the hallways. But when you really want to get to know a Member, you ask the staff what is that person really like? The staff people who are working for that Member, out of the public view, behind closed doors in the office when nobody is around, and I will tell you this: Henry Hyde was the same person  to work for as the person who would appear here on the floor of the House of Representatives. He was gracious. Now, he expected you to work hard. He expected excellence on the part of his staff, and he wanted you to do a good job. But the same pleasant man that you encountered and is fondly remembered here this evening was the same person that interacted with his staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, there are different ways to measure people. And I called Congressman Hyde on the phone in April of this year. I was walking into the Cannon building. It was an early morning.  And I called him on my cell phone, and I caught him at home. It was fairly early. And I said, "Henry, I have been here for 4 months." I said, "I marvel at what you were able to accomplish during the time that you were here."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us come from legislative bodies, State legislatures or county legislative bodies, and they are fairly intimate affairs, actually. They're fairly small groups of legislators that come together. But when you think of the figurative shadow that he cast on legislation for the past 30 years, it was a thing to behold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know he enjoyed the phone call, but it wasn't false flattery. It was actually admiration from somebody who has recently come to succeed him in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in closing, Mr. Speaker, I remember when I sat with Congressman Hyde several months before I came to this body, and at the end of a very pleasant conversation as we went back and forth on issues and talked about local politics and State politics and national politics and all kinds of issues, he said a word to me. When I share it with you, Mr. Speaker, it is going to sound like a very common thing. But when you're me and you are seated across from Henry J. Hyde, it didn't sound very common  at that point. And he said to me this: He said, "Peter, this is important work in Congress. This is important work." And there was an urgency with what he was saying to me that day. And it wasn't the whimsy of an old man who was just reflecting back on 32 years of service, but it was the admonition of a statesman who had looked out over the horizon and really understood the great challenges but, even more, the great opportunities that are here for us in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I know that I am joined by many, many, many Americans who considered Henry Hyde to be their congressman, to be America's congressman. And so it is with a great sense of pride and also a great sense of sadness and loss that I rise today, like so many of my colleagues, to honor his memory.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, there are some great Henry Hyde stories. The first time I met him was in his office in your congressional district, and he was wearing this incredible Hawaiian shirt, and sticking out of his pocket was this oversized cigar. I had never seen a cigar that big in my entire life. And he was a connoisseur of his cigars. And I remember one time my Chief of Staff had given me this cigar. He said, "I got this and you've got to give this to Henry Hyde the next time you  see him." So I was carrying this cigar in my pocket, and I needed him to sign a document, and he signed the document, and I said, "Henry, I've got this cigar for you." And I think his eyes got bigger than that cigar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a sense of humor, what a joy, what a thrill to have served with him. We are honored and blessed to have served with somebody by the name of Henry Hyde of Illinois.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues and friends this evening to honor the life of former International Relations Committee Chairman Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his 32 years in the House of Representatives, Congressman Hyde was a pioneer of conservative values and principles. As chairmen of the Judiciary Committee and the International Relations Committee, he fought to preserve the sanctity of life and to promote the tenets of freedom. His career is a testament to his character and his love for this country. It was all too fitting that President Bush honored this life and legacy earlier this year when he awarded Congressman Hyde the Medal  of Freedom--America's highest civilian honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who had the pleasure to know Chairman Hyde personally, we were touched by his immense dedication to public service, his integrity, and the wisdom he imparted to us all. He was a founding father of modern American Conservatism promoting the expansion of freedom and the limiting of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful to have known and worked with this tremendous individual, and I am grateful for his service to this Nation. Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Hyde family during this difficult time.</paragraph>
