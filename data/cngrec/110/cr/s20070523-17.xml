  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition to congratulate my friend Senator Ted Stevens on becoming the longest serving United States Republican Senator in the history of the Senate. He has had a long and distinguished career in public service representing the State of Alaska in the Senate for over 39 years, casting over 14,000 votes, and never receiving less than 67 percent of the vote in any election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My recollections of Ted Stevens, during the 27 years we have served together in the Senate, focus on his chairmanship of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, where he has done so much to promote our national security. For example, his management of the $87 billion supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 earned him high praise by President Bush during the signing ceremony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted's temper is generally misunderstood except by those who know him well. He doesn't lose it, but he does use it--and very effectively. However, it is true that on occasion he makes Vesuvius look mild. I recollect one all-night session during Senator Howard Baker's tenure as majority leader when Ted expressed himself in an unusually emphatic way. As I recall it, the debate arose over Senator Proxmire's comments about submitting vouchers for travel expense in Wisconsin on his  contention that Washington, DC, was his home base. That prompted a reaction from Ted, who was aghast at the thought of Washington, DC, being any Senator's home when he had the majestic Alaska to claim as his home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some thought that the middle-of-the-night incident might have cost him a couple votes, which could have been decisive, on his election for majority leader in November of 1984, when the count was 28 to 25 in favor of Senator Dole, but it was reliably reported that his loss occurred because of the significant slippage in votes caused by the tobacco interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any event, Senator Stevens has had a profound effect on the Senate and the Nation in his roles as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, and as President pro tempore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that Senator Stevens' career in public service began even before he arrived in the U.S. Senate. He is a distinguished veteran of the U.S. Army Air Corps, having flown support missions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force during World War II, for which he was awarded numerous medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross. He had a strong academic career, graduating from UCLA and Harvard Law School. In the 1950s, he practiced law in Alaska before  moving to Washington, DC, to work in President Eisenhower's administration. He subsequently returned to Alaska and was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964 and soon became majority leader. Finally, in 1968, he was appointed U.S. Senator from Alaska and has represented his State ever since with pride and devotion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His recognition as "Alaskan of the Century" is a real tribute, and I have no doubt that when the passage of time calls for the designation of "Alaskan of the Millennium," it will be Senator Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
