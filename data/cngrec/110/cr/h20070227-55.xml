  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>The subject of our Special Order tonight is to remember a great man of this Chamber and a great Kentuckian and a great person, a friend to virtually all who knew him. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to my friend and fellow Kentuckian, Congressman Gene Snyder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Louisville, Gene Snyder began his political career in 1954 as a city attorney for Jeffersontown, Kentucky, at the age of 26. In 1962 he ran for Congress and was elected to represent the Third District of Kentucky. After losing his bid for reelection in 1964, he turned right around and ran again in 1966. This time, he was elected to the seat that I now hold from Kentucky's Fourth District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to serve Kentucky and the Nation for another 20 years until his retirement in 1986, bringing a record of credit upon his office and doing great service to the people of Kentucky's Fourth District. Gene had a tireless work ethic, both in Washington and in Kentucky's Fourth District. He was a master political operator and strategist, and his dedication to the conservative cause was without equal in the 1960s and 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He stood by Barry Goldwater for President and was swept out of office in the 1964 Johnson landslide, only to return 2 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can personally relate to that and Gene's character and his persistence, having lost my first election and announcing on election night that I was running again and getting up the next morning and going to work for 2 more years to win and to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene was a great example with his work ethic, with his character, with his devotion and his tenacity. He enjoyed campaigning, and he relayed to me stories of many people who cut their proverbial teeth on his campaigns. I have heard stories literally from hundreds of people across the old Fourth District who remember him, who remember meeting with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He worked and reaped the benefits for those who followed him in office. He laid a foundation for those of us in the delegation who came after him. Ground work for a strong Republican Party in the Fourth District, campaigning was not something that Gene did every 2 years. It was a life-style for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was in a constant state of campaigning, reaching out, building friendships, reaching across the aisle, reaching across the fence on an arm, across the wire at the county fair, meeting people in storefronts. He used to tell me how on Saturdays he would often get in his car when he was back in the district and drive Highway 42 from Pewee Valley where he lived on up towards northern Kentucky, stopping in small coffee shops, in storefronts to visit with ordinary people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man without pretense, one who people simply knew as Gene. Everyone from our region still remembers Gene's famous campaign jingle, and more than one person has nostalgically sung the whole song to me word for word since I got into politics in 2001. We have heard those words: "Vote for Gene Snyder. He is your working Congressman."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact as recently as the last few years, that jingle, which has not been used in a campaign since 1984, was still considered the best political song in the radio stations in Louisville. Gene thoroughly enjoyed interacting with his constituents, and his enthusiasm for his job showed in his ability to recall the names of thousands with whom he came in contact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more telling was the fact that many of his constituents simply knew him as Gene. They never knew the fact that their Gene was considered by columnist Jack Anderson here in Washington as one of the 10 most influential Members of the House of Representatives because of his work ethic, because of his knowledge of the rules, his knowledge of policy and procedure, and the commitment that he made to the citizens of his district and to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in the House, Gene was an unyielding force whose visionary efforts laid the groundwork to improve our region and the lives of Kentuckians for generations to come. Though a fiscal conservative through and through, he worked tirelessly to bring Federal funds back to Kentucky and the Fourth District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did this for one purpose: he understood the value of investment and meaningful infrastructure for economic growth, to lay a foundation for job creation in the future. The key to that is what we see today, areas that were farm fields 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago have born the fruits of his investment, the seeds of his vision that were planted in economic development and economic growth that has made this area the Fourth District from the eastern part of Louisville up through northern  Kentucky one of the greatest technology growth corridors in the Commonwealth and also in the Ohio Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When my friend Rick Robinson, the new legislative director for Gene's successor, now Senator JIM BUNNING, attended a Congressional Research Service briefing on policy and procedure as a new congressional staffer, he told me recently that many of the examples that were cited by the instructors on parliamentary procedure, on the rules, on the way the House of Representatives works were all centered around Gene Snyder and his efforts, his example of being able to build momentum, his example  of being able to force an issue when it was necessary or deter or slow one down and that it was not going to be productive for his party or for the citizens of the Fourth District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is rumored that when he would walk into the committee with the Jefferson rules, the rules of the House under one arm, the chairman would simply lean over and ask him, Well, Gene, what do you want this time? As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, he helped secure Federal funding for critical transportation infrastructure in Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of Gene's projects included the Big Mac Bridge of I-471 from Newport over to Cincinnati dedicated in 1981, Clay Wade Bailey Bridge from Covington to Cincinnati, which opened in 1971. He also secured Federal dollars to protect Bellevue and Dayton from flood waters of the Ohio River. He was responsible for creative engineering to bring about, from a legislative perspective, the construction of the bridge over the Markland Dam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to highlight his creativity on these for a moment. Gene was a man who built relationships and friendships on both sides of the aisle. He was known for his card games. He was known for a happy hour that he ran out of his office in the days of the old House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, he told me late one night at his house years ago, the story of how the I-471 bridge came about. He said to me, he said, Geoff, how do you think we got that bridge? Answering as somebody from the outside, I said, Well, I figure you had the studies from the Corps of Engineers and the economic impact and the designs and the budget. He laughed and he said, No, it was the happy hour that got Newport, Kentucky, that bridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He told me how Tip O'Neill, who was a good friend of his, would regularly come by, the Speaker of the House, to his office, sit with him, play cards, have an occasional drink. One night he had come by, had a few drinks and sat back in Gene's chair, and the Speaker put his feet up on the desk and said, Gene, you've got your bridge. He built relationships to get results. He built partnerships for success on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Markland Lock and Dam is another area that illustrates his creativity in legislation. He made a comment to me on another conversation and he said, you have got to make sure you have  got a legislative director who knows how to read the rules and the laws governing every aspect of projects or investments that you want to make in your district, on guiding legislation that will benefit our citizens. And he cited this as an example. Southern Indiana and the  Central Part of the Fourth District near Carrollton and Gallatin County were suffering economically. He was seeking for a way to link that north and south commerce across the river.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was there was the Markland Lock and Dam, a Corps of Engineers structure that had no bridge. He set his legislative director to work, and his legislative counsel researched for several weeks and came about with an arcane statute from the late 1800s that stated that not a bridge, but an access road could be placed across a Corps of Engineers structure. So laughingly, late in the night he said to me, GEOFF, that is not a bridge down there on the Markland Dam that links Indiana and Kentucky.  That is an access road. And if you go and look carefully you will see that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I drove down there after that conversation just to see for myself, and I started to laugh as I looked and I saw a freestanding bridge simply bolted to the dam. And I think it was is that type of creativity that made a difference, and that dam still today is creating jobs and creating commerce and linking communities on both sides of the Ohio River to the benefit of generations that have come after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He secured Federal dollars for a wide variety of projects. Probably the two of his better known legacies are the beltway around Louisville and the Federal courthouse that both bear his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene was an extremely down-to-earth man. He was without pretense. Literally, what you saw was what you got with him. The only thing that he ever wanted to be named for him was the Federal courthouse in Louisville. This was situated directly across the street from the Louisville Courier Journal, his long time media nemesis and frankly, the media nemesis of Republicans for over a generation. Gene told me that he was thrilled that day and when that opportunity came along, that the editors who so  longed to opine against him and his fellow Republicans would have to look at the name of Gene Snyder every day as they left the employees entrance of the Louisville Courier Journal to see the Gene Snyder United States Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, not long after that conversation, one of those editors who was still working for the Courier Journal told me he figured Gene had the building named after himself just to aggravate that specific editor at the Journal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, I was proud to carry on the Gene Snyder tradition with a legacy for him to name a new intern fellowship program after him. Working in conjunction with Kentucky University, Northern Kentucky University and Thomas Moore College, my office has had the privilege of bringing talented students interested in politics to work full-time for a semester in Washington, D.C. to see the people's House from the inside, to see that it is not all the writings in a civics book, but it is relationships,  it is friendships, it is a process that the Founders gave us to move our government forward and to move the Nation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought long and hard about approaching him on the name, and I finally called him and I asked him if I could use his name. And I said, Congressman, we would be honored if we could name this program after you, the Gene Snyder Congressional Internship. He stopped for a moment and he said, well that sounds mighty fine. And then he said, you know, no, GEOFF, you need to name that after yourself. And I was taken aback as a freshman congressman when he said that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked back and forth for a little bit and I finally shared with him that I felt it would be not only somewhat ostentatious and vain for a first time congressman to name an internship program after himself, I just felt it would be inappropriate because of the legacy that Congressman Snyder had. And he stopped and he said, you know, you are right, GEOFF. Naming it after yourself may cause you some problems. So you go ahead and name it after me. I burst out laughing on the phone and I  said Congressman, I said Gene, you are just shameless, to which he responded wryly, he said no, GEOFF, I am just looking out for your best interest for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And even today we have Gene Snyder interns working in our office, carrying on the legacy that that man began when he was elected to the Fourth Congressional District of Kentucky in 1966. It is my hope that this program will continue for many years to come and will help foster that spirit of civic service that would make Gene Snyder proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October, 2006, I was part of a historic event that took place in Oldham County, Kentucky during the latter part of my campaign. It was a meeting between Senator JIM BUNNING, Gene Snyder and myself, and it was a humble privilege to be part of the final gathering of three Members of Congress who served the Fourth District of Kentucky. Gene Snyder and Senator Bunning have been constant encouragers to me and have helped make the Fourth District what it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am forever in debt to their hard work and service to the commonwealth and to our Nation. To me, the newest person to inherit a piece of this great legacy that Gene gave us, I can share that the highest compliment that I could pay to him is to say that he was real. I became a better campaigner and certainly a better and more effective Member of Congress listening to Gene's advice. In fact, just today we passed our first piece of bipartisan legislation in this new Congress, and I have put the  legacy back to the advice that he gave me before I got elected, of building those friendships and those relationships to benefit the people of this country. And I say thank you to Gene Snyder for that legislation that passed today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At one event when we were together I was trying to talk to him at length because it was just so exciting to see him. In his last years, he was not in good health and was in constant pain and I cherished the few moments that we had. But he leaned on me and he grabbed my arm and leaned over and whispered in my ear he said Geoff, you have got my vote. Now go get theirs, and pushed me towards a crowd of new people that I hadn't talked to yet. Always the campaigner, always the consummate politician,  always caring for the stewardship of the office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look at these times and the legacy that was given, I think there is no better person to share a perspective on Gene Snyder than the dean of our delegation. Hal Rogers was elected to Congress in 1980. He knew Gene Snyder during his time coming up in Kentucky politics. He knew him as a colleague here in the House, and many Members have learned from him. And I would like to yield as much time as the gentleman from Kentucky's Fifth District would consume to just share his perspective.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400340" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding this time, and I want to say to him how much I appreciate him taking this Special Order out as the successor to Gene Snyder in that district to allow us to pay tribute to this legendary figure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came here in January of 1981, and Congressman Snyder had been here, of course, long before I got here, had been here at that time I guess 14 or so years. But he took me under his arm and taught me many of the same lessons that the gentleman has just referred to. A kind, gentle soul. But when he had a project on his mind you better get out of the way because he was tough, and he knew what he was doing. And he carried in his pocket a list of those who voted against his bill so that if you wanted  a favor from Gene Snyder you had better be on his list that he always carried with him. He would always refer to that list when he was thinking about helping his colleagues. And that made him very, very effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a dear friend and a mentor of all of us. He was particularly helpful to me as a freshman Member of this body. And I was very, very sad to see him leave the body in 1986. But he deserved a retirement. But we never could get him to come back to Washington to see his friends. When he finished his work here, he was finished with his work here and he retired to his home in Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At his funeral last Saturday in Louisville, a beautiful ceremony, Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, the Republican leader in the Senate, from Louisville,  an intern in Gene Snyder's office, that is where he got his start, paid Gene Snyder one of the most beautiful tributes that I think I have ever heard. The eulogy that Senator McConnell gave to Gene Snyder is memorable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Mr. Speaker, I am going to quote that eulogy because it says what I would like to say myself, except it has been said so well by the Senator. So if you will bear with me, I am going to quote the eulogy that Senator McConnell gave at the funeral Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Twenty years have passed since Gene Snyder said goodbye to Washington. We gave him back to Pat, and she took good care of him until the end. We honor you, Pat, for your devotion to Gene on the wonderful journey that was marked by much suffering in these last years, and we share your grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Kentucky politics has been known to produce some fine storytellers. Marion Gene Snyder was one of the best. You wouldn't want to share all of these stories with the League of Women Voters, or the Plague of Women Voters as he called it. But when Gene died last week, one of the greatest Kentucky stories of all time came to a close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Born in West Louisville to Marion and Lois Snyder, Gene came of age in a time and a place where you worked hard, went to church on Sunday, and always voted democratic. His dad worked a number of jobs to support the family. Gene summed up his childhood like this: I was a poor boy, he said from the other side of the tracks in a cold water flat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"But what he lacked in privilege he made up for in smarts. Politics called at an early age and Gene responded in the only way he knew how. He gave it everything he had. He enrolled at the University of Louisville, went to law school. He volunteered as precinct captain before he was old enough to vote and he won his first political appointment as Jeffersontown City Attorney in 1954 at the age of 26.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to read now from Senator McConnell's eulogy at the funeral, he says, "party officials saw his talents right away, and 8 years later, they tapped him as a candidate for Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Youth wasn't the only obstacle he faced. Let's not forget that back then, "conservative" was a bad word. When Gene was preparing his run, a famous Harvard economist summed up the national mood. These are the years of the liberal, he said. Almost everyone now so describes himself,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Not Gene. He was conservative before being conservative was cool. And he made no apologies for it. Most people would have excused him for moderating his views until he got his feet under him. But he wasn't the type to bend in the direction of the crowd. He stood still and watched as the rest of the country bent toward him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, continuing from the eulogy that Senator McConnell paid tribute to Gene on Saturday at the funeral, "he was 35 when he arrived in Washington with the rest of the class of '63. He had a lot to say and a way of saying it. He saw a lot that year. A President assassinated, a new administration and the stirrings of an anti-American counter culture that he would battle, always with good humor, for much of the rest of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It was a difficult time, but it was exhilarating too. Young conservatives were quietly developing the ideas that would one day drive the political culture in Washington, and men like Gene Snyder, who dared to speak those ideas in a hostile crowd, gave all of them reason to hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Those were the thoughts that were going through my mind at least, Senator McConnell says, when I applied to be an intern in Gene's office after my junior year at U of L. Like most interns, I spent most of that summer in the mailroom. But I was working for a man who knew what he believed. That appealed to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It appealed to me even more when I saw him lose his seat the following year. Most Republicans were running away from their party's presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater. Gene stood still. He embraced Goldwater, even when it was clear that Lyndon Johnson was about to destroy him in the general election. He brushed off the loss with customary good humor. He took out an ad in The Washington Post that read, "caught in the LBJ landslide. Congressman must sell three bedroom, one and a half bath  home on large lot near schools and churches."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"When a curious reporter called the number on the ad, Gene picked up on the other end. Johnson carried my district by 64,000 votes, he said. I lost by 16,000. That means I was 48,000 ahead of Goldwater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I wouldn't have done anything differently in that campaign, he said. I don't think you should rise above principle just to win an election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"So he came back home, started over and won again 2 years later as a proud conservative. And for the next 20 years the people around Louisville and Northern Kentucky knew they were home when they heard Gene's campaign jingle come over the radio. I think most folks felt the same way about that jingle as the customer who walks on to the screen in that Head-On commercial and says, the commercial is annoying, but the product is great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The gentleman from Kentucky made the most of his time in Washington. He threw himself into his work with the enthusiasm of a child. It was a different time. Slower, more congenial, more fun. Gene Snyder was the perfect man for those times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, continuing from the eulogy that Senator McConnell gave at the funeral Saturday, "the people around here learned the art of politics by watching him lean over fences and shake hands with tobacco farmers in Carrollton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They learned to enjoy it, too, the way he did, riding up Dixie Highway in a Lincoln car on warm summer nights, stapling his campaign fliers to telephone poles until the sun went down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"A master of the practical joke, Gene once told a staffer to find a reception room in the Capitol that hadn't been cleaned up from the night before and to bring back the flowers. A little while later, one of the female staffers on the Public Works Committee found the flowers on her desk with a love note. Gene wrote the note, but he signed it with the name of an unsuspecting male staffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"His humor even found its way into legislation. The Kennedy Center was supposed to be a self-sustaining institution. But when it couldn't pay its bills, it would ask the Public Works Committee to help out. Gene was the top Republican on that committee, and he didn't like the idea at all. So he introduced a bill proposing Friday night wrestling at the Kennedy Center as a way of boosting ticket sales.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"A visitor to the House of Representatives in the late 1970s might have noticed a large man in a brightly colored sports coat. Gene liked to dress himself when Pat was out of town. Well, C-SPAN put an end to that. One day three worried viewers from Kentucky called Gene's office to say their Congressman was on fire. The camera made his cranberry and orange jacket look like he was engulfed in flames.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Gene always enjoyed a relaxing atmosphere. After a late night at the Capitol, Members always knew where they could relax or have a drink. The third floor of the Rayburn House Office Building was a good bet. You might find Gene there playing gin rummy with friends or telling a story. You would just follow the laughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"By 1979 most of the Nation had moved firmly in Gene's direction. Goldwater finally won his election in the person of Ronald Reagan, and Republican officials in Louisville were excited. I remember because there were about two of us back then, me and Gene. We announced our support for Reagan together, and Kentucky voters would give our 40th President their endorsement a year later."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, continuing from the eulogy that Senator McConnell gave at the funeral Saturday:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Gene's good humor was matched by his skills as a lawmaker, though he didn't like to admit it. 'I'm a lawyer,' he'd say, 'but not enough to hurt.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Yet anyone who worked with him knew he was one of the great parliamentarians of his day, someone who brought a staggering knowledge of the rules to the Public Works Committee and a lot of good things back to Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He was instrumental in building the Jefferson County Floodwall, the Markland Dam Bridge, the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge in Covington, and the Banklick Creek Watershed Flood Control  Project. He was responsible for the Dayton Floodwall; the Falls of the Ohio Wildlife Conservation Area; the renovation of the Louisville Post Office and the Louisville Courthouse; and a new terminal at Standiford Field; new bridges in Covington and Newport; the Gene Snyder  Airport at Falmouth; and, of course, the freeway. That is what Gene called it anyway. Just the freeway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Gene embodied the old rule that Members of Congress should be friends after 5 o'clock. He was a committed conservative, but even liberal Members lined up to thank him in his last days in Washington. One of them had this to say: 'Gene Snyder has been devoted to building things like bridges across rivers and streams, but he has also devoted himself to devoting goodwill among people.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"When the last staffer turned off the lights and pulled the door shut on Gene's Capitol Hill office, an era in Washington ended. The people in the Fourth District saw a lot more of him and Pat. The members of Owl Creek Country Club would hear his stories now. The people at Concordia Lutheran saw him quite a bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"But Washington would miss, and still misses, his common touch, his lack of pretense, his principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Age and illness would take their toll in the last years of Gene's remarkable life, but his humor remained. Old friends would call just to hear the recordings on his answering machine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"But now death has done its work, and a great American story comes to an end. Yet we know it continues. This husband, father, lawmaker, mentor, and friend goes to the Father's house now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We take comfort in trusting him to the Lord of Mercy, who tells us that in the life to come, every question will be answered. Every tear wiped away. And we look forward to the day when we see Marion Gene Snyder again, upright, restored in body, healthy and strong, reaching across the fence to take our hands."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, that is the eulogy that Senator MITCH MCCONNELL of Kentucky, the senior Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, as he delivered the eulogy to our friend Gene Snyder Saturday at the funeral in Louisville. I read the eulogy because I could not say it any better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene Snyder was a legend in his own time. He is a legendary Member of this body. He was one of the most powerful Members of this body for many years. But beneath that sometimes publicly crusted personality was that warm, gentle spirit and warm, gentle heart; that helpful person who reached out a hand to help those who needed it, whether it be a Member of Congress or a person back home looking for help on a Social Security claim or a veteran's pension or the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We won't see his kind again, unfortunately, but I am glad that I had the honor and privilege of knowing Gene Snyder for many, many years, listening to his advice, laughing at his stories, and enjoying the companionship that we did. God rest his soul.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Rogers, I think you captured the emotion and the power of that funeral, the eulogies, the reminiscences that brought so many to laughter. Sitting with Gene and Pat Snyder was always a wonderful journey back to the old House in the days before C-SPAN, before 24-hour news cycles, before multimillion dollar campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing that struck me about him when I first met him was his complete lack of pretense. As a young man, I couldn't believe this was a Congressman, compared to the image that one would have on TV, somebody so approachable, so transparent, and his great gift of humor. He could teach with humor. He could scold with humor and make his point very clearly. He was a man who built friendships that transcended partisan differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congressman Rogers mentioned from Senator McConnell's eulogy, one of his great friends in the House was Congressman Carl Perkins, who represented what is now the western part of the Fourth District, centered in Ashland, Kentucky, in Boyd County. He and Carl Perkins could fight on the floor, fight in the hallways on issues, but at 5 o'clock they were friends, and they were strong friends committed to the Commonwealth, committed to the future of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a strong leader. And probably the highest compliment that I could pay him is that he was real. And that fact is never lost on those who knew him. Those who were his foes in legislation had tremendous respect for him and invariably they liked him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real fruit in a person's life comes from the seeds that are sowed in many lives, the fruit that is born from that. I think of several names to mention here that come to mind. Congressman Rogers shared his perspective on Gene's influence in his life. I have shared mine on his influence on me. My wife, Pat, and I used to live in La Grange, Kentucky, down near the Louisville suburbs. My first campaign chairman in Olden County was Harold Smith. Harold Smith, as a young attorney in 1966,  managed Gene's first campaign for Congress in the Fourth District, and then he helped manage my first campaign for Congress in 2002 and then again in 2004 and again in 2006. I think about that legacy of friendship and how he reached out and was known by so many in the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another was his staff director on the Public Works Committee, Mike Toohey, who also was with us on Saturday. Mike left government at the time that Gene retired and had a long and distinguished career in government relations, helping Ashland Oil, later Ashland Inc., to reach out and communicate its needs and the needs of our citizens in Kentucky legislatively and was a great friend to the Commonwealth and was also one of those products of Gene's influence and his mentorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another was Joe Whittle, who met Gene the first time in 1975 when he was running for attorney general in Kentucky at a time that it wasn't cool for Republicans to be running on a statewide ticket. Gene called him up on the phone. Joe was a little taken aback to get a phone call from the famed Congressman Gene Snyder, but he invited him to come up to meet him in Louisville and then drive up to Northern Kentucky to give a talk at the Beverly Hills Supper Club to a large group of Republicans there.  When Gene got up to introduce Joe Whittle, he used his humor to make that strong point about how he had sized up Joe's character, and he said, This is Joe Whittle. He is a lawyer but not enough to hurt. And they instantly became friends and were close and intimate friends until a week ago when Gene left this Earth. Later Joe Whittle became the United States Attorney for Western Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investment that Gene made in so many lives has transcended their immediate impact and gone to other generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anne Gernstein, who is now the chairman of the Olden County Republican Party, was his office manager at his office in Louisville. And before I first met Gene, I met Anne. She was helping with the local campaign, and I walked in the door as a new volunteer, just wanting to get involved in politics, and I would have never thought at that time that I would have the great honor and privilege to follow in the legacy of that great man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene, we will miss your humor and that twinkle in your eye right before you are about to spring a joke on someone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Pat and the children, thank you for sharing this great man with us. Your hospitality and kindness are remembered by so many that you have touched throughout the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene Snyder left an indelible imprint on Kentucky and our country. With his passing, Kentucky has lost, and the Nation has lost, a great leader and a true statesman; but his legacy continues to live on.</paragraph>
