    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think we all know that the best economic stimulus is a job. It is a job that you can sink your teeth into, that you can go to work every day and you can use this job to provide for your family. So, as the debate ensues, let's keep our focus on how policies affect the environment in which job growth takes place. Of course we all want to see lower marginal rates on our income tax rate. We want to lower cap gains. We want to lower the corporate tax rate. We want  to see full and immediate section 179 expensing for our small businesses. And for those of us that live in States that do not have a State income  tax, we want to see deductibility of State sales tax extended. All of these are good things and, Madam Speaker, we are working for all</paragraph>
