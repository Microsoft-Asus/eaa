    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week President Bush nominated former Congressman Jim Nussle to run the Office of Management and Budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just before Mr. Nussle and President Bush took charge of America's books, we had a $236 billion surplus, the largest in U.S. history 3 years running. Under President Bush's watch and Jim Nussle's, in 5 short years we had a $318 billion annual deficit and $300 trillion in new debt owed to the Chinese and other foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard a lot from this President and the GOP Members about the importance of fiscal responsibility. We Democrats couldn't agree more. Unfortunately, when it comes to George Bush and the Republican Congress, we will forever be in their debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Nussle once said, can we continue to fund our war efforts on this type of ad hoc basis? I believe most of us would agree that we cannot and should not. We continue to give President Bush a blank check costing us nearly $1 trillion on credit card funding for this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Nussle and President Bush came to change Washington, and Washington changed them. Nominating Mr. Nussle tells Americans a lot of what they can expect from a Republican administration.</paragraph>
