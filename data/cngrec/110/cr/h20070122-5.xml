  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) is recognized during morning hour debates for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, all over Capitol Hill people are preparing for the State of the Union speech. Iraq, global warming, health care are all at the top of everyone's list. One that, unfortunately, will be suspiciously absent is the topic of a conference that is taking place just across the Potomac River, the third National Dialogue on Water Resources. Yet there is nothing that is more important than the discussion about water. Indeed, if you are talking about war and peace, climate  change and health care, they are all directly related.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Water is not just a potential source of conflict, but of conflict resolution. You can actually measure water flows in quality. If the Israelies and the Palestinians can solve their water issues, who knows where it could lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health. One-half the people in the world today who are sick are sick due to water-borne disease, almost all of which is preventable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Global warming. We are concerned about global warming because of the impacts that are directly water-related: rising ocean levels, coastal erosion, storm surges, disappearing snow pack and polar ice, flooding, rainstorms; too much water too little water in the wrong places at the wrong time. Global warming is all about water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that regardless of what is discussed in the State of the Union and thereafter, that we can add this subject to the top of the list of the 110th Congress, to work with the administration and people on both sides of the aisle to build on one of the few areas of bipartisan progress that we have seen in the recent toxic atmosphere on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 108th Congress, we were able to work to reform the flood insurance programs, before Katrina. In the 109th Congress, we had the landmark Water For the Poor Act that I was able to work on with Republicans Henry Hyde and Senator Bill Frist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some simple steps that we can take now. I hope that Chair LOWEY and Ranking Member WOLF will fund our international water and sanitation commitments. I hope that out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee we will update the hopelessly outmoded Corps of Engineers water principles and guidelines that are over a quarter century old and lead to bad decisions. I hope that we can continue Chair FRANK's commitment to further flood insurance reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Others are going to take more of a lift, but we can use water supply and quality in the farm bill to pay farmers to do the right thing and make a profound difference on water around the country. We can shift our frame of reference to deal with basin-wide water management; and we can use the huge value implicit in water resources to fund our crying needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At core, Madam Speaker, it is time for us to match our policies on where the water comes from, which date back to the beginning of our country and were basically frozen in place by 1950, to overlap with our water quality and environmental and health protections which have been developed largely since that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Money is actually less of a problem because, while water is priceless, we are doing silly things with it; for example, subsidizing people to grow cotton in the desert. When we have an era where for bottled water, some people are paying up to $8 a gallon or more, we are paying more than gasoline or cheap wine, there are ways that we can tap into that value. We spend too much on uncoordinated infrastructure investments with inappropriate pricing, poor planning and incremental fragmented management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the possibility to refine those partnerships, both public and private, to bring together the Federal agencies, even Congress itself, to limit our stovepipe mentality with fewer subcommittees and more policy management. It is not really that hard. College students, farmers, local government officials, Girl Scouts and church youth groups understand these basic principles after the most basic of study. It is time for the rest of the players to catch up with them, and I hope starting with  the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
