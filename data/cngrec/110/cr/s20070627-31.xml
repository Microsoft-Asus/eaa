    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I also pay tribute to Carley Smith of Harrodsburg, KY, on being recognized as a winner of the Library of Congress's 2007 Letters About Literature competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Letters About Literature is a reading and writing program sponsored by the  Library's Center for the Book. Throughout the country more than 56,000 young readers in grades 4 through 12 participated in the program, which encourages young kids to read and write a letter to their favorite author, of any era, whose books inspired them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carley chose to write about author Judith Guest's "Ordinary People." She was one of two winners chosen this year in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Carley for her dedication and commitment to reading and writing. In order for our society to continue to advance in the right direction, we must encourage more young people like Carley to read and write as often as possible. She represents Kentucky at its finest.</paragraph>
