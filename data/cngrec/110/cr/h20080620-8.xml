    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with oil and gas prices climbing to record highs and families struggling to make ends meet, what did Congress do to help this week? Well, we voted on monkeys. Yes, we voted to prohibit you from driving a monkey across State lines. We also had a lengthy debate on whaling. But no votes to increase energy supplies to lower gas prices. Good for monkeys, good for whales, but not good for America's families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-seven percent of Americans support safe, environmentally sound exploration of our resources. The American people understand that we need more American energy, not Saudi Arabian, not Venezuelan or Russian energy dependence. American energy means we are creating American jobs, not funding plush skyscrapers in Dubai. And lower prices allow us to invest our dollars in alternate energy and conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week, I introduced House Resolution 1282 to encourage the removal of the executive ban on drilling along our Outer Continental Shelf. The President has the power to remove this ban today, if he chooses. I invite all my colleagues to cosponsor my resolution. Let's bring relief for America's families.</paragraph>
