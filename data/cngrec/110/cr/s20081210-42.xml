    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize Mrs. Ursula Villere on her 90th birthday which occurred November 30, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Villere has been a Louisianan all her life, born in New Orleans and residing in Metairie since 1955. She graduated from Dominican High School and then Dominican College, where she was a member of the KKI Sorority. Taking a further interest in education, she proceeded to teach school both in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish until retiring in 1980. She is a loyal parishioner of St. Angela Merci Church and a loving mother and grandmother. She has 7 wonderful children who have given her 14 fantastic  grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
