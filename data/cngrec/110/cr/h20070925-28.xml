  <narrative>FUNDING FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10762]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the continued politics being played with this year's veterans funding by the majority party. Last week, 44 Members of Congress sent a letter to the Speaker urging her to immediately bring a conference report on veterans funding before the House. Our goal was to pass this funding and avoid the political gamesmanship of the appropriation process. Earlier this year,  the House and Senate both passed veterans  funding with overwhelming support. The fiscal year ends on Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, it has become clear that the top Democratic aides intend to hold our veterans hostage. A spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee called our letter and efforts to pass veterans funding immediately just "a cute diversion."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is nothing cute about withholding funding for veterans benefits. There is nothing cute about withholding funding for veterans health care. There is nothing cute about Democrats using veterans as political pawns in their appropriations strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues not to let veterans funding be held hostage any longer. Our veterans are saying, don't betray us. Pass the fiscal year 2008 appropriations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
