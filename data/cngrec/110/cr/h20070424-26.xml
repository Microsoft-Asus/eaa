  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to address my concerns for the 5.4 million Texans who are without health insurance. Nearly 25 percent of Texans are uninsured. That's the highest rate in the entire country. The irony is that Dallas and other cities have great health care networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that of access to care. In Dallas, there are many examples of health care excellence, including Parkland Memorial Hospital, Baylor University Medical Center, Methodist Medical Center, UT Southwestern Medical School, the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the price of insurance is robbing Texans of access to the appropriate medical care. Emergency rooms are overcrowded. Only half of Texas children are covered by employment-based insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must fix the problem of the uninsured. Affordable, accessible health care coverage should be available to every American. Health care should not be a cash cow for the insurance companies.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
