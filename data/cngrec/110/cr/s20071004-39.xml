    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the great joys of my job as a Senator is the opportunity to recognize exceptional people. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize seven exceptional people: Ivana Hong, Nastia Liukin, Samanthat Peszek, Alicia Sacramone, Bridget Sloan, Shayla Worley, and Shawn Johnson. These young ladies make up the U.S. women's gymnastics team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September of this year at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championship in Stuttgart, Germany, the U.S. women's team won a total of four gold, two silver, and one bronze medal, placing them first overall in the women's team competition. I congratulate the members of this team, their coaches, and families on their success and for their exemplary representation of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an Iowan, I would like to recognize a particular member of the U.S. women's team, Ms. Shawn Johnson of West Des Moines, IA. Ms. Johnson won the all-around women's gymnastics title at the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship. With this great achievement, she became just the fourth U.S. woman ever to win a world all-around title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Receiving such a title takes incredible talent and athletic ability. But, without a doubt, it also takes a lot of hard work. At the age of 3, Ms. Johnson began her gymnastic training at Chow's Gymnastics in West Des Moines, IA, where she continues to train today. As a result of years of hard work and training, she has competed and won at progressively higher levels of competition. In 2006, she won the U.S. Junior National Championship; in 2007, the Visa National Championships and the Pan American  Games, where she won four gold and one silver medal. Next, Ms. Johnson will be competing for a spot on the U.S. women's gymnastic team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my sincere congratulations to the U.S. women's gymnastics team on their success and I wish them luck on their future endeavors.</paragraph>
