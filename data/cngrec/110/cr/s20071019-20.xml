    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to COL Herbert S. Lockett, former ombudsman for the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. Colonel Lockett has a long and distinguished history of service to our Nation, both as a soldier and as a volunteer ensuring that National Guard and Reserve soldiers are prepared for battle. His service, both on the front lines and behind the scenes, is noble and commendable. It is for this reason that I honor him today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Lockett served as a combat medic in the Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II, earning a Bronze Star, an Outstanding Leadership Commendation, and three Campaign Stars. He cared for those who were wounded and risked his own safety in service to others. Those who brave bullets to provide care are truly heroic, and Colonel Lockett was no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to serve in Korea as an infantryman, where he earned a Silver Star for Gallantry at the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. While his unit had taken heavy casualties, and many in his unit threatened to desert, he took charge and they fought until reinforcements arrived, earning two Presidential Unit Citations and credit for 2,000 Chinese KIAs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after retiring from active duty, Colonel Lockett continued to serve his country. Colonel Lockett has been a volunteer with National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve helping to prepare soldiers in National Guard and Reserve units to be deployed for combat operations. For his efforts in this regard he has been awarded the James N. Roche Spirit of Voluntarism Award, the highest award given by the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President it is my honor to pay tribute to this great Alabamian, and most of all this great American. He serves as a shining example of the American spirit. He is loved by all who know him for his tireless work and determination.</paragraph>
