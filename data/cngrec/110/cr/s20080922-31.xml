  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="HONORING JAMES KETELSON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I commend James Ketelsen for his vision and commitment to transforming the hopes of tens of thousands of students and families across the country through Project GRAD, an education reform program that he started when he was chairman and CEO of Tenneco in Houston, TX. Project GRAD has helped these students realize their academic potential and many of them have completed their college education with the assistance of Project GRAD scholarships and mentoring support  from Project GRAD staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Project GRAD evolved from a scholarship program that began under Mr. Ketelsen's leadership at Tenneco. In 1988, the company began to fund a 4-year scholarship program for eligible graduates of Davis High School, at the time Houston's lowest-performing high school. By 1992, the number of Davis graduates entering college had more than quadrupled. Still, high school graduation rates and college matriculation rates continued to fall short of Mr. Ketelsen's expectations. He believed that Davis students--and  all students from economically disadvantaged communities--were capable of much more if given the right investments and the right commitment. "It's not the kids!" he insisted. Armed with that belief, Mr. Ketelsen has dedicated the last two decades to making an enormous difference for America's highest needs students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Project GRAD has expanded to 13 communities and reaches more than 120,000 students and families from California to New York, Alaska to Georgia. In the longest-served group of schools, GRAD scholars are completing college at a rate 92 percent above the national average for students from similar demographic backgrounds. A statistically significant sample of GRAD scholarship recipients who have completed college shows that the proportion who graduated with majors in science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics--concentrations of dire need for the national economy and national security--exceeded the national average for minority students by 71 percent. In the coming academic year, more than 7,500 students will attend college, funded by a Project GRAD scholarship. GRAD has already sent high school graduates to more than 100 institutions of higher education, including many of the most highly selective</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the energy and enthusiasm with which Mr Ketelsen has served America's children and families. Recently, Mr. Ketelsen announced his decision to step down from his post as chairman of the board of directors for Project GRAD USA. Although he is retiring from Project GRAD USA, he plans to remain active with the Houston chapter of Project GRAD. I join with my colleagues in saluting James Ketelsen for his efforts to improve education and career opportunities for children in inner-city  schools. The return on his investment in education will continue for generations to come..</paragraph>
