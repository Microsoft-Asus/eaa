  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate Rules Committee reported <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I voted in favor of reporting the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would require Senate candidates to file election-related designations, statements, and reports in electronic form with the Secretary of the Senate. It also would require that the Secretary of the Senate forward a copy of those filings to the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours so that they can be made available to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note for the Record that the bill as introduced and reported would require that Senate candidates file directly with the Secretary of the Senate, and not the Federal Election Commission. I support continuing this policy, and ensuring that the Senate as an institution retains custody of these campaign-related filings. According to testimony before the Rules Committee last month, the office of the Secretary of the Senate is fully capable of implementing this requirement and ensuring  that these documents are made available to the public expeditiously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the efforts of the Rules Committee on this matter</paragraph>
  </speaking>
