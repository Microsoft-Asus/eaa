  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life and service of Elwood Lechausse of Manchester, CT, who died on Saturday May 17, 2008. Mr. Lechausse, known to many as "Woody," enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1958, the day after his 18th birthday, and served with distinction in the 101st Airborne Division in both Turkey and South Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lechausse's service to his country did not end with his departure from the military in 1965. Following his honorable discharge from the Army, Mr. Lechausse dedicated himself to supporting his fellow veterans. For over 35 years, Mr. Lechausse was a tireless advocate for veterans issues, serving in leadership positions in more than two dozen veterans organizations, including serving as a senior member of the Department of Veterans Affairs Board of Trustees and the Secretary and Treasurer of  the Connecticut Veterans Coalition from 1988-2002 and the Department of Connecticut Adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lechausse worked hard to educate his fellow Americans on the importance of honoring our veterans and recognizing the challenges they faced. Whether testifying before the U.S. Congress or speaking in the local classroom, Mr. Lechausse carried himself with a vigor and passion that spoke volumes of his dedication to advocating on behalf of his fellow veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Mr. Lechausse was named as a Connecticut Treasure for his work on behalf of Connecticut's veterans. In 2007, in recognition of the many lives he touched throughout nearly four decades of service, Mr. Lechausse was inducted into the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lechausse was a valuable friend of my office, and all of us in Connecticut owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Lechausse for his service to both his country and his fellow veterans. On behalf of the Senate, I offer my most sincere condolences to Mr. Lechausse's wife, Kathryn, his children James and Ralph, and all those who were touched by his tremendous spirit. With Woody's passing, Connecticut and the Nation's veterans have lost a powerful voice that will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
