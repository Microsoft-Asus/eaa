    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of the Mason County High School boys' basketball team. The Mason County Royals won the Kentucky State Boys' Basketball Championship on March 22, 2008, at Rupp Arena in Lexington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mason County Royals defeated the Covington Holmes Bulldogs 57-48 in the championship game. Tournament MVP Darius Miller scored 19 of his game-high 24 points in the second half of the championship, to lead the Royals to victory. This year marked the 12th time in 28 years that the Mason County Royals advanced to the Sweet Sixteen Tournament and the second time the team has won the Kentucky State Championship. The young men on this team are not only championship-caliber players, by but all accounts,  students and leaders who are a credit to their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to congratulate the coaches and fans who support the team. Coach Chris O'Hern guided the Royals to victory. The team also received tremendous community support, evidenced by 17,000 fans that traveled to Lexington to attend the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in congratulating the achievement of the Mason County Royals on their State championship. It's an honor to represent this team in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
