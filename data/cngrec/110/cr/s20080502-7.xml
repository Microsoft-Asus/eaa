  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - May 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3737">S3737</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is obvious that there is not going to be any legislating done on this bill--until at least the vote on Tuesday. I had hoped we would be doing things today and Monday. Monday is a long-established no-vote day. But it is not fair to Members to have to worry about being back here when there is nothing being done on the bill--they have other things they can do--based on the Republicans' refusal to let us legislate on this most important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are not even going to be in session on Monday, I announce to all the Senators and their staffs. We will be out of session Monday and come back on Tuesday, and, hopefully, the Republicans will see the light of day. Maybe they will get a call from the White House saying the air traffic situation in this country is important. He should notice what is going on in the Senate and make a call to the Republican leadership in the Senate and let us move this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we will start legislating on Tuesday, hopefully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
