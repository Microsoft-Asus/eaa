  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="Introducing S. 626. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for arthritis research and public health, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="626">S. 626</bill>] Mr. President, with more than 100 different forms, arthritis is one of the most widespread and devastating health conditions in the United States. Nearly 46 million, or one in every five, American adults suffer from arthritis or chronic joint symptoms, and 300,000 children live with the pain, disability and emotional trauma caused by juvenile arthritis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the leading cause of disability in the United States, arthritis is a painful and debilitating chronic disease affecting men, women and children alike. This is why the Federal Government must make a stronger investment in research, treatment and prevention of arthritis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that early diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate management of arthritis can control symptoms and improve quality of life. The Arthritis Prevention, Control and Cure Act will expand the Federal Government's efforts to find new ways to prevent, treat, and care for patients with arthritis and related rheumatic diseases by: (1) improving coordination among Federal agencies and the public with regard to the Federal investment in arthritis research and public health activities through a National  Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases Summit; (2) accelerating research that will lead to improved treatments and a cure for juvenile arthritis; (3) investing in a nationwide public health initiative designed to reduce the pain and disability of arthritis through early diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease; and (4) ensuring kids with arthritis have access to specialty care by addressing the nationwide shortage of pediatric rheumatologists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a responsibility to look for solutions to this issue in a comprehensive manner. I look forward to working with Senator Kennedy on this important legislation which will make a real difference in the lives of the millions of Americans, both young and old, who suffer from this debilitating disease.</paragraph>
