  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the recess recently, one of the men from whom I learned a great deal, I hope with some impact about how to be a successful advocate for a better and fairer world, died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leon Shull had been, for many years, the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action. He had a passion for social justice which he combined with a clear-headedness about how to get there that was extraordinary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often in our politics, we see a divide between the people with passion, the people with reason, people who feel very, very deeply about the need to correct injustice, and people who are able to calculate in a cool manner what types of political activity will be effective. Leon Shull was one of those rare people who combined both of them in a way that made each of those qualities more important. There wasn't any trade-off with Leon between his pragmatic and clear-headed political analysis  and his strong idealism. His idealism and his pragmatism worked together. They strengthened each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was determined to be effective because he felt that he had a moral obligation not simply to will a fairer world, a world with fewer poor children, a world with less discrimination based on race or gender or sexual orientation or religion, a world with less widespread killing for unjustified reasons; he felt the moral obligation to diminish those things to the extent that any one human being could. And because he felt morally obligated to do it, he knew he was morally obligated to be effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He worked with many people who would give in from time to time to that wonderful feeling of just lashing out, of just letting your emotions run. But he knew the work to which he was committed was too important for that, that he owed the children and the victims of racism and poor, elderly people and working people thrown out of jobs, people in other parts of this world living in dire poverty, he knew that he owed them not just goodwill, but a commitment to making their lives better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was for many years the leader of Americans for Democratic Action.  Americans for Democratic Action immediately after World War II under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt and John Kenneth Galbraith and Walter Reuther and others was a very important organization in which liberals fought a two-front ideologic war against conservatives who wanted to retreat from the New Deal on the one side and from Communists who were anti-democratic on the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As time went on, the Americans for Democratic Action, ADA as it is known, became less important, probably because the Democratic Party, I believe, moved more in that direction. But it was still important to have that organization then as it is now as an independent force, and Leon Shull kept that organization vibrant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an expression used about boxers who are fighting in a weight class heavier than their own, that they are able to punch above their weight, that they have a strength and a physical ability that allows them to be competitive with people bigger and theoretically beyond their reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leon Shull punched above his weight, and ADA under him punched above its weight. He was in this city for many years a beacon for those of us who believed that the liberal tenets of Franklin Roosevelt were still very relevant, that a wealthy society in the United States had both the obligation and the resources to diminish inequality, not to dispose of it altogether in a capitalistic system, but to diminish it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leon Shull was an ally of people fighting racism, of people fighting poverty, of people fighting unjust wars, of people fighting for rational environmental policy, of people fighting for free speech and fairness. And with all that, he was a gentle man. He was a fierce advocate of these policies, but in personal demeanor a man of gentleness, a man who inspired the love and affection of those who worked with him. In later years he retired and he moved away from Washington, and I saw much less of  him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I read of his death, I realized as I thought about it all that he is one of the people from whom I learned a great deal. To his wife, Anne, to his daughters and others who have lost this great man, I send my deepest sympathy; and to his memory I express my gratitude for being the model of an effective liberal.</paragraph>
