  <narrative>GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5485]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for many Americans, pulling up to the gas station is becoming a dreaded event. There have been some short-term remedies, but with prices at $4 per gallon, any relief must be paired with a broader energy plan which unlocks American resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current U.S. policy unnecessarily keeps many areas off limits to exploration, restraining additional growth and supply. High fuel prices impact rural areas the hardest. Long commutes are a way of life, and crushing gas prices have hit farmers and ranchers in every aspect of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, several special interest groups have said no to virtually  every solution, including clean, renewable hydropower, non-emitting nuclear power, clean coal technology, wind power, and domestic exploration and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been over 20 years since President Ronald Reagan called on Congress to lease ANWR. It has been over 30 years since a new refinery has come on line. Since then, America has paid the price for delay, and we are paying the price every time we pull up to the pump.</paragraph>
