  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the national media continue to devote a disproportionate amount of news coverage to the Democratic Presidential campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, on the day before the Republican primary in Michigan, NBC's Today Show gave almost 7 minutes to the race between Democrat Senator BARACK OBAMA and Senator HILLARY CLINTON, compared to about 30 seconds to the close Republican race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NBC isn't the only network giving more coverage to the Democratic campaign. The January 7 edition of ABC's Good Morning America devoted almost 15 minutes of coverage to analyzing the race between BARACK OBAMA and HILLARY CLINTON. Just 30 seconds were given to the Republican side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to encourage the media to report with fairness rather than partiality. Only then can the American people get the balanced coverage of this important Presidential campaign that they need and deserve.</paragraph>
