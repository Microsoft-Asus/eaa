  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LINDA NELSON -- (Senate - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4101">S4101</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is an old saying that no exercise is better for the human heart than reaching down to lift up a child. Whenever I think about Linda Nelson, that saying comes to mind because she had devoted her life to nurturing and educating and lifting up children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, for the past 4 years, as president of the Iowa State Education Association, Linda Nelson has devoted herself to lifting up the teaching profession in the State of Iowa. She has fought for better pay and professional development, for more generous funding for public education, and for commonsense reforms to the No Child Left Behind Act. She has done an exceptional job for Iowa's teachers and education support professionals. However, I know that she is looking forward to returning next  fall to her real love, which is the classroom at Carter Lake Elementary School and the students she has missed so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda Nelson has led and served ISEA with true distinction. Under her leadership, membership has increased and local associations have been strengthened. She tirelessly crisscrossed the State of Iowa to visit schools and to consult with teachers and support professionals. I am told that she has been away from home so much that her cats no longer recognize her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have always loved what Lee Iacocca said about teachers. "In a completely rational society," he said, "the best of us would be teachers, and the rest would have to settle for something less." Fortunately, in Iowa, so many of our best do go into teaching. And Linda is one of those truly outstanding classroom professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She graduated from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and has taught for more than 30 years. She has been an active member of ISEA throughout her career. She has held leadership positions at the local, State, regional, and national levels. In 1992, the National Education Association recognized her outstanding contributions to public education with the Charles F. Martin Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, Linda's first love is the classroom. But she is committed to securing a quality education for every child, not just those in her classroom, and this has led her to activism in the broader public and political arenas. She was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1992 and served for 4 years as an outspoken champion of quality public schools for all of Iowa's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a teacher, Linda Nelson is a consummate professional, and she speaks with that special authority that can only come from decades of classroom experience. She has been an association president, a mentor, a leader, a legislator. But of the many titles she has worn during her long and distinguished career, she prizes none more highly than the simple title of "teacher."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda Nelson is one of the many reasons why Iowa public schools are among the most respected and highest achieving in the Nation. We are blessed with an extraordinary cadre of talented teachers, and this is a real point of pride among Iowans. We honor our teachers. We are grateful for their keen minds and generous hearts. We appreciate the long hours they devote to their work--their service above and beyond the call of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda Nelson has made a very real difference for the good as president of the Iowa State Education Association. As she returns to Carter Lake, I join with educators across Iowa in thanking Linda for her service, and wishing her the very best in the years ahead.</paragraph>
