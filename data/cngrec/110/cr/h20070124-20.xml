    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, unfortunately I was unable to cast my votes on the following rollcall votes on January 24, 2007. Had I been present to vote, I would have voted as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 51--The Previous Question for the Rule to consider <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>--I would have voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 52--To Table the Motion to Reconsider--I would have voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 53--Final Passage of the Rule for <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>--I would have voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 54--The Motion to Table the Priveleged Resolution--I would have voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 55--The Motion to Adjourn--I would have voted "yes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 56--The Question of Consideration of <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>--I would have voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On rollcall 57--To allow Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole--I would have voted "no." Our Constitution clearly sets forth who is allowed to vote in Congress and I believe that this bill is in direct violation to that provision.</paragraph>
