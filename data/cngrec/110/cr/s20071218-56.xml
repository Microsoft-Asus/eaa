  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS FOOTBALL TEAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize a group of hard working student athletes from my hometown who continue to make history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past Saturday, on a mud soaked field in Savannah, TN, the Carroll College Fighting Saints football team claimed their fifth National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championship in the past six seasons. The Fighting Saints overcame the weather and a tough squad from the University of Sioux Falls in South Dakota to prevail with a 17 to 9 victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carroll College is a private, Catholic college in my hometown of Helena, MT. Carroll boasts an enrollment of about 1,500 students and is known around the country for its award-winning academic and preprofessional programs. Carroll is particularly strong in premedical, engineering, and nursing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Saints enjoy great support from the community of Helena and from folks all across Big Sky country. Fans pack Nelson Stadium on the Carroll campus each Saturday when there is a home game. Rain, snow, sub-zero temperatures--nothing will stop the Carroll faithful from coming out to cheer on their beloved Saints. I always look forward to being a part of the crowd whenever I can. The student cheering section known as the "Carroll Crazies" joins with parents and community members to create an  atmosphere that is so energetic on game day you would think you were at a much larger school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like hard working folks all across Montana I value my money, but I was so confident that Carroll would be victorious in the title game that I made a little wager with my good friend from South Dakota, Senator Tim Johnson. The winner gets some delicious buffalo steaks my staff and I look forward to enjoying them. A special thanks to Senator Johnson for being such a good sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the title game the Saints were led by running back Gabe Le, who slogged through the mud to pick up 116 hard-fought yards and scored Carroll's only two touchdowns on the day. For his efforts Le, a sophomore from Hayden, ID, was named the offensive player of the game. Le started the season as a backup but found his way into the starting lineup and rushed for over 100 yards in each of Carroll's four victories in the playoffs. The Carroll defense rose to the occasion and slowed down Sioux Falls'  high-flying offense. Hard hitting linebacker Owen Koeppen, a junior from Florence, MT, took the honors as defensive player of the game. Koeppen has also been named to the 2007 American Football Coaches Association NAIA All-America Team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 edition of the Fighting Saints was particularly dominant. They finished the season a perfect 15-0, running their record over the past 6 years to an astounding 79 to 6. The squad didn't surrender a touchdown until the eighth game of the season and gave up an average of less than five points per game. Carroll outscored their opponents by a combined total of 370 to 72.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Head football coach Mike Van Diest, a native of East Helena, came home in 1999 to coach the Saints. In addition to the five national titles, the Saints have won eight straight Frontier Conference championships and made it to the semifinal round of the NAIA playoffs seven times under his direction. Van Diest is not only a fantastic coach who has built a winning football program; he is an even better person, husband, and father. Mike has taught his players many life lessons along the way. He preaches  the importance of getting a quality education, the value of teamwork, and the need to give back to the community. This embodies the service mission of Carroll College and the school's motto, "Not for school but for life." Coach Van Diest has a lifetime of respect and appreciation for the Carroll standard and tradition of excellence and the college is truly blessed to have him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of Carroll's athletic programs have enjoyed great success as of late. This fall the women's soccer team won the first ever Frontier Conference Championship and claimed their first ever victory at the NAIA national tournament. The men's and women's basketball team and the volleyball team have also won numerous conference championships in recent years and have represented the school proudly in regional and national tournaments. This record of excellence can be attributed to the fine student  athletes that come to Carroll from towns small and large all across Montana and the Northwest. These individuals put it all on the line not only on the playing fields and courts but also in the classroom. I appreciate and admire this tradition of excellence in both athletics and academics. Many athletes achieve honor roll status and go on to experience</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to congratulate the president of Carroll College, Dr. Tom Trebon, whose leadership and dedication have made Carroll the highly regarded institution that it is. I look forward to cheering on the Saints again in 2008 as they begin their quest for an unprecedented sixth national title. I know they will make Montana proud.</paragraph>
