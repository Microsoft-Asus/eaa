  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to announce the recent appointment of my legislative fellow for 2007, Ms. Reta LaFord, to the position of Deputy Forest Supervisor on the Coronado National Forest in New Mexico and Arizona. Reta has been invaluable in my office throughout this past year, specializing in Native-American and natural-resource issues. Her 20 years of experience working for the Forest Service in Montana and other parts of the West provided me with greater expertise related to how  the Federal Government can successfully work with the tribes and other stakeholder groups on critical land management issues. She has particular sensitivity to the cultural concerns of the tribes in the West, and the USDA Forest Service will indeed gain from her knowledge and understanding</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish her the very best and thank her for her devoted service to the great state of Idaho during 2007. She will be missed in my office.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
