    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Sunday, July the 20th marked the 34th commemoration of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. That invasion claimed the lives of 5,000 Greek Cypriots while an additional 200,000 were forced from their homes. Today, nearly 36,000 Turkish soldiers, 1 soldier for every 2 Turkish Cypriots, are embedded in Cyprus, occupying 35 percent of the island. It is one of the most militarized areas in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Turkish and Greek Cypriots, themselves, live in harmony, making the occupation all the more unacceptable and unnecessary. There have been  no recent incidents of violence between the two communities. In a show of friendship, Ledra Street, which connects Greek and Cypriot Cyprus, was recently opened for the first time since 1964. Thirteen million Greek and Turkish Cypriots have crossed the border, each time without incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the House, House Resolution 620, which I cosponsored, cites these crossings as evidence of the goodwill between the two communities, and it refutes the Turkish claim that a military presence is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we remember the invasion to split Cyprus in two, it is important to note that there are concrete efforts underway by the heads of the communities to reunify.</paragraph>
