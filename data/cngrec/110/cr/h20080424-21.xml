  <narrative>COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2666]</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee resumed its sitting.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to inquire how much time remains on each side.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Minnesota has 2 1/2  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 9 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to a gentleman I mentioned in my opening remarks, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), who has been a true leader in the House of Representatives on this issue of shoreside and waterside security for LNG facilities.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague for yielding time and for his work with me on an amendment to this bill that I think will improve the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee and the ranking member of the full committee for their work in bringing together a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the bill, but I want to emphasize that our Nation has a growing demand for natural gas, and this amendment that I'm going to offer with my colleague and friend, Mr. LaTourette, will help to ensure that we don't halt future domestic liquefied natural gas expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some localities have turned their backs on this promising energy solution. And if we're going to solve our energy problems in this country, we have to make sure that we diversify our sources to the fullest extent. In Louisiana, we have prided ourselves upon producing and delivering energy that all Americans rely upon, and liquefied natural gas is certainly no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past Monday, I was down in Cameron Parish on the coast of Louisiana in my district with Secretary Bodman for the opening of the first liquefied natural gas facility to be constructed in this country in over the past 25 years. And this facility, once fully operational, will be the largest liquefied natural gas facility in the world. It's going to supply approximately 5 percent of all U.S. natural gas needs when fully operational. It has two 42-inch pipelines that will connect to provide natural  gas for 75 percent of all the markets in the United States. And within the next decade, 25 percent of all natural gas will run through my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So clearly, as we look at this bill, we should not have provisions that could potentially kill future liquefied natural gas expansion by arbitrarily legislating that no new facility can be certified unless the Coast Guard has the assets on hand to carry out the security measures. The Coast Guard does not need to do all of this. They have limited assets. And down in my district they have worked very well with local authorities, sheriff's department, other local authorities, to bring all assets  to bear to provide the necessary security. The Coast Guard must be allowed to continue to have this ability to partner with local agencies and waterway users, state government, local law enforcement, to manage and protect our waterways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first delivery of natural gas into the newly constructed Sabine Pass facility that I just mentioned illustrates this point. The Sabine-Neches Navigation District manages the overall river maintenance. They help fund local law enforcement efforts. And the Jefferson County, Texas sheriff's department provides helicopter overflight security. Cameron Parish, just across the river in my district, provides the marine patrol supplement. And all of this is done under the approval and guidance of  the Coast Guard. So we're not undermining what the Coast Guard does, we're merely enhancing what the Coast Guard is able to do to provide security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>A cooperative approach is working on the gulf coast. It allows the Coast Guard to work with Southwest Louisiana authorities and Texas authorities in this situation. We shouldn't handcuff these communities in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge the adoption of the amendment as we go forward with this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, could the gentleman yield 15 seconds?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield 15 seconds to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Both gentlemen made a splendid statement on the issue and during the amendment process. Because of the persuasive case you've made, we are prepared to accept your amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time--if the gentleman is reserving his 2 1/2  minutes--it's my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>I also want to commend the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, who is really interested in transportation issues, a good man of heart, and I applaud your leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this authorization bill brings 1,500 new Coast Guardsmen. We're proud of their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My debate, my concern, over the past 2 weeks, obviously, is energy and the increased cost of bringing on the 1,500 new Coast Guardsmen in addition to the burden on the government. It would be better if we had lower energy costs to help meet those needs, but we don't. We have higher costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the Coast Guard uses aviation fuel too, quite a bit of it. So does the United States Air Force. For every $10 over a barrel, it costs our Air Force 600 million more dollars out of the budget. We know the burden on the Coast Guard helicopters. We know the cost to the Coast Guard ships that are diesel run. For every dollar increase in diesel fuel, it costs the Coast Guard $26 million to operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is the kind of the charts I have been using over the past 3 weeks and will continue to use this ad infinitum until this country, which is the greatest country on the face of this Earth, does what other developing countries do: that we go and explore and use our own resources to meet our own needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that we are dependent upon imported crude oil. Shame on us. Shame on us when we have the ability to meet our energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is what happens: When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. Today it dropped a dollar from last week, $116. That's the problem. What's the problem at the pump? From $2.33 to $3.55. Bringing climate change legislation, 50 cents of additional tax on gasoline, we would be paying $4.05.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's the solution? One, use our abundant natural resources in our country, coal-to-liquid technologies. In Illinois alone we have 250 years' worth of energy just waiting to be brought on line, turned into liquefied fuel, lowering the cost of diesel to our Coast Guard, saving the taxpayers money. But we won't move on any bill that brings on fossil fuels and expansion of fossil fuels on this floor. Shame on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's another solution? The Coast Guard protects our coast. Look at the red area over there: the Outer Continental Shelf, ripe for exploration development, natural gas, crude oil. But, no, it's off-limits. We can't get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about Katrina. The Coast Guard performed admirably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know what we forget? Remember that big cloud that rolled up? Tell me the major ecological damage based upon all those oil platforms in the coast. Can you name one? No. Not a single one because we can do it safely. So we can do it safely in those areas. We should not have to burden the taxpayer with $26 million of cost for allowing crude oil prices to go up. We shouldn't do that. And that's why it's important to lower our prices.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>May I ask--I know the chairman has 2 1/2  minutes--how much time do we have?</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Ohio has 3 1/4  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would yield myself such time as I may consume to engage in two short colloquies with the chairman of the full committee, if I may.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first of all, would you be willing to enter into a colloquy regarding the withdrawal of funds from the seamen's accounts authorized under section 405?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I invite the gentleman to pursue this colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it's my understanding that it is current practice for seamen on passenger vessels to be paid in cash. Section 405 authorizes the deposit of their pay into certain approved accounts. The section also requires that those funds be available for withdrawal. I understand that, as a practical matter, many seamen want to make sure that they can make those withdrawals in cash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the chairman and the chairman of the subcommittee be willing to work with us in conference to clarify the amounts that can be withdrawn from those in cash up to the amount of a seaman's pay?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Most certainly. This is a 120-year-old practice in seafaring, and we ought to address that issue, as the gentleman has rightly raised it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second colloquy, if you'd be kind enough to engage in a colloquy relative to the delegation of certain functions of the Coast Guard to classification societies.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of course. Please proceed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the unnumbered section in your  amendment that replaces section 318 as reported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee adds a new subsection, subsection (d), to section 3316 of title 46 of the United States Code. Under paragraph (2) the Secretary may delegate the Coast Guard's authority to a foreign classification society "to the extent that" the government of the society's home country, one, accepts  plan review, inspections, or examinations conducted by ABS, and, two, provides to ABS equivalent access to inspect, certify, and provide related services to offshore facilities under that country's jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that some foreign countries do not use a delegation system but instead accept plan reviews, inspections, or examinations performed by classification societies as part of a comprehensive operating plan submitted by the offshore leaseholder. Concerns have been raised that the Secretary may construe acceptance of the ABS plan reviews, inspections, or examinations as part of those comprehensive plans to be something less than full acceptance of plan review, inspections, or examinations  in the United States, thus limiting the work that classification societies headquartered in those companies could perform in the United States and limiting the work that ABS can perform in foreign offshore markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the Chair be willing to work in conference to clarify what constitutes fair and full access by ABS to work in foreign offshore markets and by foreign classification societies headquartered in countries which do not use delegation schemes to work domestic offshore markets?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for raising this very complex issue on which we've devoted an enormous amount of time and visited with the Norwegian Ambassador and other interests, the American Bureau of Shipping and others, and I'm committed to working with the gentleman to resolve this issue in an equitable and fair manner as we proceed forward with it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November of last year, the container ship COSCO BUSAN collided with the San Francisco Bay Bridge and spilled 58,000 gallons of bunker fuel into San Francisco Bay. The spill was one of the worst environmental disasters in San Francisco Bay history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have included language in this bill that would require the Coast Guard to have marine pilots carry their own navigation devices, commonly known as Portable Pilot Units. These devices are an easy and practical way to improve maritime safety and to protect our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Cummings, and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the ranking member, Mr. LaTourette, for working with us to include this language. I think it's very important language that could prevent these kinds of accidents from happening in the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412253" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is no question that America entrusts the Coast Guard to secure and properly maintain and administer America's waterways and port facilities. The task before this Chamber today is not about oil prices. In fact, it's about the Coast Guard and their ability to quickly and effectively respond to intense demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans live along the coast, and they depend upon the Coast Guard to provide that layer of protection and security. In California, where the 11th District resides, 2,600 active and 3,500 volunteer auxiliaries have saved over 500 lives. Properly funding the Coast Guard's programs through this legislation of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> will not only enhance marine safety but reduce the risk of maritime terrorism on some of our Nation's most sensitive ports.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Today is a great day for the Great Lakes and the coastal areas. Today is a terrible day for the zebra mussels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member LaTourette for their good work on this bill, because it contains measures to inspect and treat and exchange ballast water to prevent any more of those nasty invasive alien species from getting into this country, and into its waters. It now costs us about $13 billion every year for the damage caused by invasive species. This bill will help stop any future species from coming in, and I hope we will be able to develop methods  of treating these critters so that we can get rid of them and once again enjoy the pure waters of this country the way we should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So thanks again to both of you for doing this, and let's get out there and fight those nasty zebra mussels!</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chairman for the time and applaud him for his leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also want to thank him and Subcommittee Chairman Cummings for their work in bringing this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the Coast Guard Authorization Act. This bill makes important strides in strengthening the modern day mission of our Coast Guard and enhancing our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also included in this bill is language clarifying the rule related to the taxation of interstate waterway workers. Under current law, most employees whose jobs require them to work in multiple states, such as our rail and airline workers for example, are taxed only by their state of residence. This has previously not been true for waterway workers. In an effort to address the unsettled tax situation of waterway workers throughout the country, I authored legislation in the 106th Congress called  the "Transportation Employment Fair Taxation Act." The legislation barred states from taxing a nonresident waterway worker "who performs regularly-assigned duties while engaged as a master, officer, or crewman on a vessel operating on the navigable waters of more than</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I have recently been made aware of a 2006 decision by one state's tax court that is inconsistent with the intent of the 2000 law. The court concluded that because the bill uses the word "of" instead of "in," it only applies the waterways that are owned jointly by more than one state. This was not the intent of the 2000 law. The legislative history at the time makes clear that it was not the intent of the law. And I know what the intent was because I authored the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today makes a slight wording change to the 2000 law to clarify that the law is intended to apply to all interstate waterway workers on all waterways, not just workers who work on waterways that are jointly owned by two or more states. It is my sincere hope that this minor change will, in no uncertain terms, make clear that states are prohibited from taxing the income of a non-resident interstate waterway worker. I want to make clear that this is the intent of the language  in the bill before us today, and it remains the intent of the law I authored in 2000.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first thank the gentleman from Ohio for his very generous and very kind and thoughtful remarks. I greatly appreciate the camaraderie we share and the partnership in doing the work of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan, who gave most insightful comment on this whole bill. It is a bad day for zebra mussels and spiny echinoderms and a whole host of other invasive species that we're going to deal with severely as this bill moves to enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to observe that the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) is concerned about five Bay Area lighthouses, Point Montara, Alcatraz Island, Lime Point in Fort Baker, Point  Diablo, and Point Bonita, and we will work with the gentlewoman and the Coast Guard to expedite transfer of those Coast Guard facilities to the U.S. Park Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, I want to say, as I did at the outset, we took our time all through last year and part of this year to craft a splendid bill in an inclusive manner, hearing out the concerns of the Coast Guard and addressing extensively the concerns of the Republican members of the committee to be thorough and produce the best bill possible, and we are happy to bring this bill in good time to the House floor today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi, and before we begin our debate on the Coast Guard Authorization Act for 2008, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purposes of a colloquy with Mr. Thompson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Thompson, would you please join me in remembering the sacrifice of Damage Controlman Third Class Nathan B. Bruckenthal of the U.S. Coast Guard, who was killed off the coast of Iraq on this date in 2004? He was the first U.S. Coast Guardsman to have been killed in battle since the end of the Vietnam War.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Petty Officer Bruckenthal and two Navy petty officers were killed during a coordinated suicide attack on the oil platforms off the coast of Iraq. These men offered what President Lincoln referred to as "the last full measure of devotion" for their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, Petty Officer Bruckenthal is survived by his wife Patricia and their daughter Harper. We all join in thanking them for their sacrifice. Petty Officer Bruckenthal represented the very best of the U.S. Coast Guard and what it has to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> is an important milestone in protecting our Nation's port and maritime security. It is the first bill to provide adequate resources to an agency that has been systematically underfunded for years. <bill type="h" number="2330">H.R. 2330</bill> authorizes 1,500 additional Service Members, more Maritime Security Response Teams, more Canine Detection Teams, and the Waterway Watch program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was favorably reported by my committee on a bipartisan basis last fall. Representative King and I share a commitment to the Coast Guard. I am pleased that we were able to work together to give the Coast Guard the resources it needs. For too long, the Coast Guard has had to make do with aging assets that do not meet the challenges of a 9/11 world. The Coast Guard is actually still operating boats that were used during World War II. It is time that these boats were retired and  newer assets brought into service. These boats, however, must work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has accepted, under the Deepwater contract, boats that can't even float. That is unacceptable. The American public and the men and women of the Coast Guard deserve better. The Homeland Security Committee has added the Deepwater reform provisions during our markup to get this critical program back on course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings for displaying a willingness to work with me to bring this bill to the floor. I urge passage of this important legislation that will significantly improve the security of our Nation's maritime environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, let me thank Chairman Thompson for his and his staff's hard work in reporting a bill from our Committee on Homeland Security in September that I believe was the result of solid bipartisan compromise, and for Chairman Thompson's continued cooperation over the past several months as the committee worked to bring this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, we have heard from those of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee many of the good things in this bill. I must say, however, I am disappointed that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee largely ignored the committee on Homeland Security's improvements, particularly to those provisions relating to LNG security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our committee's approach was reasonable and risk-based, as we have attempted to approach all of our problems with respect to homeland security, that is with a risk-based approach, the language adopted by the other committee, I fear, abandons the risk-based approach and assumes a cookie cutter, one-size-fits all approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) has an amendment that would clarify that State and local resources can be considered when identifying resources available to provide the newly mandated security patrols, and I would hope that his amendment would be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very concerned about two entire titles that were added to the bill after they were considered by four committees of jurisdiction. A new title X shifts 80 percent of the Coast Guard's Administrative Law Judge resources and several of the Coast Guard's ALJ authorities to the National Transportation Safety Board. This is being proposed as over 1 million TWIC cards are being issued to our rail, truck, and port workers. These are those biometric cards that we have spent so much time developing  and hoping that it would finally get in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effect of this provision, I fear, could leave only two ALJs, that is Administrative Law Judges, to hear any appeals to TWIC denials. That has been one of the great concerns we have had. If we have this TWIC system set up, how can people appeal if they have been denied their TWIC cards. This would dramatically slow the appeals process, to the detriment of port security and our Nation's port workers, who are relying on a timely adjudication of a TWIC for their livelihood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a recent letter from TSA opposing this proposal states, "ALJs at the Coast Guard have built up expertise in transportation security matters, and I fear this provision will negatively impact not only TWIC, but other programs as well, including hazardous materials endorsement, and may result in even higher fees for these workers."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield, yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just briefly to clarify that point. We do not transfer ALJs from the Coast Guard. We leave those in place, just transfer the venue, and we will provide both in this bill and in the subsequent NTSB authorization funding for additional ALJs at the NTSB, as we did in aviation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>I hope that is true, reclaiming my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just tell the gentleman that is the case.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, the effect of the provision is to take 80 percent of the resources that are currently allocated to the ALJ, Administrative Law Judge program, and that in effect would make it very, very difficult for them to continue, since they have a total of seven ALJs, and if you take 80 percent of the funding, I believe that would leave us with about 20 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to include a copy of this letter from TSA in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arlington, VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Congressman King: I am writing to express the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) strong opposition to Title X--Appeals to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the manager's amendment to <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the "Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007." Title X would transfer  Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) authority for review of merchant mariner documentation and 80 percent of the Coast Guard ALJ budget to the NTSB.  This could have an adverse impact upon the adjudication of TSA's civil enforcement cases and anticipated cases dealing with the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TSA questions whether sufficient legal, administrative, and budget resources will continue to be provided to the Coast Guard to support its remaining ALJ functions, including adjudication of TSA security cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 5 years, TSA has been extremely well served by the Coast Guard ALJs as fair, impartial, and responsive adjudicators in security cases involving individuals in the transportation sector. Under an interagency agreement, Coast Guard ALJs play a major role in TSA's enforcement and security credentialing programs. They adjudicate aviation security civil penalty cases, Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) and TWIC denials of requests for waivers and appeals from individuals who have  received a Final Determination of Threat Assessment; appeals by air cargo workers who have received a Final Determination of Threat Assessment; and appeals by individuals holding or applying for Federal Aviation Administration certificates, ratings, or authorizations who have received a Final Determination of Threat Assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the absence of sufficient ALJ legal and administrative resources at the Coast Guard, TSA does not regard NTSB ALJs as a good alternative. Coast Guard ALJs have substantial expertise in fair adjudication of security programs. NTSB ALJs do not have expertise in transportation security matters. As TSA continually expands the implementation of the TWIC program and the Coast Guard enforces it at our Nation's seaports, TSA and TWIC applicants will benefit from the substantial experience Coast Guard  ALJs have in the maritime security environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Coast Guard ALJs have been sensitive to the challenges faced by individuals representing themselves in a formal administrative process and have worked with TSA to develop simplified procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TSA and Coast Guard have worked together for years to establish caseload management procedures, agreements, and funding processes to efficiently handle TSA cases. For example, the Coast Guard serves as TSA's Docketing Center for its formal hearing process. Shifting the workload to ALJs of another agency would create a huge setback for TSA enforcement and administration. ALJ coverage, budgeting, processing time, and even geographic availability would have to be reassessed and reestablished, a  process that may take several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, TSA's HME and TWIC are fee-based programs. TSA developed its fee models based on Coast Guard cost estimates and processing models. If conditions necessitate TSA's seeking ALJ services outside Coast Guard, this could affect program costs, and consequently, fees for applicants.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The second new title, title XI, creates an assistant commandant for marine safety and a vast new super structure, including Marine Safety Specialist, that receive special benefits such as geographic stability and special promotion system. It provides for the possibility of additional pay for Coast Guard personnel in the marine safety field. Unfortunately, with no regard for those Coast Guard men and women engaged in other critical, dangerous missions like search and rescue, national defense,  and port security. I wonder if we really want to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It appears to elevate the Coast Guard's marine safety mission above all others. Most notably, the Commandant of the Coast Guard has real and serious concerns about this reorganization language that has never been considered by any committee, to my knowledge. I would think we would want to seriously deliberate these provisions in an open forum and give the Commandant an opportunity to voice his concerns to the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Broun of Georgia has introduced an amendment stripping these two problematic titles so they can be considered on their merits by the appropriate congressional committee, and I am pleased that his amendment has been made in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other improving amendments offered by the Committee on Homeland Security members include Mr. Bilirakis of Florida, an amendment to make the Coast Guard's incredibly successful biometric identification pilot program more permanent. I hope this amendment is adopted. It will help us positively identify individuals with weapons, drug trafficking, and murder convictions, and help us keep them out of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Mr. Poe and I are offering an amendment with language to make operations of the stealth mini submarines illegal. These subs, which can carry up to 10 tons of cocaine into the United States, and have done so, would be equally capable of transporting weapons of mass destruction or would-be terrorists. They are immediately scuttled, once detected, making prosecution nearly impossible. So I hope that this amendment, when considered, would be approved on this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If these concerns are not adequately addressed here on the House floor, I would look forward to working with the Senate in a conference to ensure that the men and women of the Coast Guard have the resources it needs to continue to protect the citizens of the United States. The Coast Guard is one of the jewels of our overall executive branch, particularly in DHS, and this bill, this reauthorization bill recognizes that. Although it has some defects, as I mentioned, I hope we can work those out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2008, <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, which will allow the Coast Guard to appropriately balance its dual missions of safety and security. In the past few years, we have increasingly depended on the Coast Guard to ensure our shores against drug smuggling, acts of terrorism, and other suspicious activity, while simultaneously keeping recreational and commercial boaters safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has been required to do more with less. This important measure will reverse that trend by providing an additional 1,500 Coast Guard personnel and $8.4 billion in increased funding to ensure that the Coast Guard can carry out all of these responsibilities successfully. I am particularly pleased this bill will increase oversight and efficiency of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or the TWIC program as it's known, which has encountered numerous  problems since its inception nearly 6 years ago. Many businesses, particularly those in my home State of Rhode Island, particularly those hiring seasonal and temporary employees have experienced economic hardship under the program. But the bill before us will help fix many of the problems associated with the TWIC program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> will require the Coast Guard to protect and enforce security zones around all existing liquefied natural gas, or LNG facilities, and encourages State and local entities to assist the Coast Guard with this important mission. This provision will allow LNG facilities to safety operate in densely populated areas, such as those in my home State of Rhode Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Chairman, I commend both Chairman Thompson and Chairman Oberstar for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from California for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in defense of the most important resource in my home State of Michigan, the Great Lakes. The Coast Guard bill contains a measure that will strengthen ballast water treatment requirements for oceangoing ships. For years, these ships have brought with them the scourge of invasive species. I am proud to support these new treatment requirements and consider them an important move to protect our Great Lakes waters for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While not all invasive species have made their way into the Great Lakes through untreated ballast water, ballast water still remains one of the most common avenues into the Great Lakes for destructive aquatic invasive species. The ballast water treatment provisions included in this bill will go a long way toward keeping invasive species out of the lakes. Requiring ships to exchange their ballast water 200 miles outside the U.S. will help solve the problem in the short term before ships are required  to have the ballast water treatment equipment installed in their ships in 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in Michigan face threats to our Great Lakes from many angles, from those who try to pollute them, to those who try to take our water. I am proud today that we have successfully strengthened the ballast water treatment requirements that will protect the health of our Great Lakes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank both Chairman Oberstar and of course Chairman Thompson and Subcommittee Chair Elijah Cummings on this Coast Guard bill that all of us have worked on. As the Chair of the Transportation Security Subcommittee of Homeland Security, I can assure you that the idea of overcoming the administration's veto on the question of LNG security is going to be an important stand today as we vote for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The language that speaks to the LNG security is a fair statement. It gives the Coast Guard flexibility. It allows them to make an assessment, and it is the right thing to do. Coming from the City of Houston, with a very large port, I understand the need to protect the surrounding communities and the importance of LNG security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am grateful that I have an amendment going forward that will help expedite the TWIC card for so many who have not yet gone through the process, to make an assessment by the Coast Guard of the necessity of more resources, of keeping the facility open 24 hours a day and making sure that this TWIC process goes in order to secure those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also grateful that we have increased the Coast Guard overall to 47,000 and that the underlying bill refocuses on the value of the Coast Guard, both in terms of their standard duties, but also the new enhanced duty for security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that as we move TSA administrative law judges, however, that we will find a way to ensure that TSA is not impacted negatively and that we will have oversight to ensure that this process will continue to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Chairman, this is an important legislative initiative. This again is the Homeland Security Committee and the Transportation Committee and the two chairpersons and committee members working harmoniously together, recognizing that the bottom line of what we do on the floor today and what we do for the American people is to ensure their security. We have done that today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically vote for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Minnesota, Representative Oberstar. This important legislation will provide our Nation's Coast Guard with the resources it needs in order to successfully execute all its missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I believe protecting our Nation by air, land, and sea to be critical to our national security interests. This bill, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007, sets forth various provisions that will be beneficial to our maritime interests, and consequently to our national security. Included in the provisions are the establishments of grants for international maritime organizations, the establishment of the Merchant Mariner Medical Advisory Committee,  and codified various provisions relating to Coast Guard personnel matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some years now, I have been concerned about the diversion of Coast Guard resources from their historic missions of search and rescue and marine safety, to homeland security missions. Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Coast Guard's inclusion in the Department, one of the greatest challenges has been ensuring that the funds that the Coast Guard have traditionally received in order to perform their duties remain intact so that they can fulfill the responsibilities  that American citizens rely on them to perform, namely ensuring the safety of our Nation's seas, lakes, rivers, and ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we have to ensure that the Coast Guard will get their full funding which is absolutely necessary to carry out their responsibilities, and that is precisely what this legislation does. This act authorizes appropriations for FY2008 for the Coast Guard. Furthermore, this act also authorizes the FY2008 levels of Coast Guard active duty military personnel and average military training student loans, allowing for sufficient human resources for the Coast Guard to achieve its designated  goals. This bill explicitly authorizes end-strength by 1,500 members to 47,000 and increasing Coast Guard funding to $8.4 billion which has not been done since the 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act also includes provisions regarding shipping and navigation, vessel size limits, maritime drug law enforcement, fishing vessel safety, liability limits for natural gas deepwater ports, claims against the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, dry bulk cargo rescue, merchant manner matter, and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I was pleased to work with Chairman Thompson and offer an amendment during our Homeland Security Committee markup to this important legislation, which I felt improved the bill. My amendment mandated the creation of a strategic plan to utilize assistance programs to assist ports and facilities that are found by the Secretary not to maintain effective anti-terrorism measures. I am also offering an amendment on the House floor today calling on the Secretary of Homeland Security  to examine the challenges and delays faced by transportation workers seeking to obtain TWIC cards at enrollment sites and mandates the development of timelines and benchmarks for implementing the findings of this assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, every year, 95 percent of the goods coming into the United States arrive at our Nation's seaports. These goods are shipped from ports around the world, some from developed countries and others from developing countries. I am particularly  concerned about ports in developing countries. Developing countries have limited resources which means their ability to maintain effective anti-terrorism measures is limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot allow terrorists to exploit this limitation. Rather, we should work with developing countries and others to build up their anti-terrorism measures. This assistance will benefit all of us. The developing countries will gain the support they need, and we will close a potential gap in our own supply chain. Every gap we close is one less gap that can be exploited by terrorists. I am pleased that this bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a strategic plan to utilize  existing assistance programs to assist foreign ports and facilities that are found by the Secretary not to maintain effective anti-terrorism measured. This bill furthermore authorizes the Coast Guard to lend, lease, and donate equipment and provide technical</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007 includes specific provisions relating to Minority Serving Institutions (MSls). Within this legislation, MSls are defined as a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic serving institution, a Tribal College or University, a Predominantly Black institution, or a Native American-serving institution. Section 901 of this important legislation states that the Commandant shall establish a management internship program for students  at MSls, enabling them to intern at Coast Guard headquarters or Coast Guard regional offices in an effort to support the development of civilian, career-midlevel, and senior managers for the service. This legislation furthermore instructs the Coast Guard to work with the National Association</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have long stressed the importance of including this Nation's MSIs in the effort to secure our Nation. Section 903 of this legislation states that the Commandant shall establish Guard. Laboratory of Excellence-MSI a Coast Cooperative Technology Program at three minority serving institutions to focus on priority security areas for the Coast Guard, such as global maritime surveillance, resilience, and recovery. It also calls on the Commandant to encourage collaboration among the  minority serving institutions selected to participate in the cooperative technology program and institutions of higher education with institutional research and academic program resources and experience. These and other measures included within this bill are absolutely imperative as the Office of Workforce Planning has recently revealed that only 5 percent of the officer corps is African American and only 12 percent of the officer</paragraph>
    <paragraph>corps is comprised of ethnic minorities, while in the last 3 years the numbers of minority ascensions have actually decreased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007 also increases oversight and efficiency of the TWIC program, which was originally mandated 6 years ago, yet continues to flounder. To date only 230,000 out of an estimated 845,000 applicants have enrolled in the TWIC program, while the deadline for enrollment is September 25, 2008. While this provision of the Coast Guard Authorization is both timely and important, there is still more which must be done in order to ensure that the program is both effective  and efficient, which is why I have offered an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to reiterate only a few of the obstacles that workers have faced in my State of Texas as well in my district of Houston. For example, a marine worker enrolled at the Houston Port enrolled on December 13, 2007. To date, he still does not yet have a TWIC card. He remained on hold for 4 hours and 10 minutes and was finally told by the operator that he would have to return to Houston to be fingerprinted again after APR. Incidentally, a representative of Higman Marine Services, Inc. asked  the same question about their employee, and she was told that he should not return until June. This blatant inconsistency in service and information is simply unacceptable. Furthermore, another transportation worker went to the Beaumont center about three weeks ago to pick up his TWIC after being notified it was ready. He traveled from Hemphill, TX (117</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment calls for the Secretary of Homeland Security to compile an assessment of the enrollment sites for transportation security cards issued under 7 section 70105 of title 46, United States Code within 30 days of enactment. The assessment should, at a minimum, examine: the feasibility of keeping those enrollment sites open 24 hours per day, and 7 days per week, in order to better handle the large number of applicants for such cards; the feasibility of keeping those enrollment sites open  after September 25, 2008; and the quality of customer service, including the periods of time individuals are kept on hold on the telephone, whether appointments are kept, and processing times for applications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment furthermore calls on the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop timelines and benchmarks for implementing the findings of the assessment as the Secretary deems necessary. By identifying the areas in which enrollment sites for homeland security cards are ineffective and inefficient and creating a timeline through which to implement necessary changes and benchmarks to ensure their progress and accountability, we will make this Nation a safer place accessible to labor and operations  alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Transportation Security Administration has expressed some concern over Title X of this legislation. Title X would transfer Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) authority to review merchant mariner documentation as well as 80 percent of the ALJ budget to NTSB. I understand the TSA's concern that such a step might have an adverse impact on anticipated cases dealing with TWIC and adjudication of TSA's civil cases, and I am committed to working with TSA to ensure that the  execution of this legislation is beneficial to all parties involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long before the horrific events of September 11, 2001, citizens of American relied upon the Coast Guard to ensure the safety of our waterways, and we depend on them still. Therefore, I urge my fellow members of Congress to also support the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007 and ensure this rich and necessary tradition remains a thriving and useful part of not only our national defense strategy but also to protect us and the environment from those threats by sea.</paragraph>

As the chairwoman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism, I have the jurisdiction over the Coast Guard's security missions. I am very pleased that the Homeland Security Committee had the opportunity to mark up this legislation and that we included several provisions that will strengthen the Coast Guard's maritime security activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill increases the Coast Guard's end strength by 1,500 members to ensure that there are adequate personnel to carry out all of the Coast Guard's missions. This addresses my long-standing concerns about inadequate staffing at the Coast Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also requires the use of security zones around all liquefied natural gas, or LNG, facilities. This is a critical step in stopping these facilities from becoming targets as the number of LNG imports increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will also improve the lot of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or the TWIC, by providing more facilities where workers can submit their fingerprints so they can enroll in TWIC more efficiently and meet the September 25, 2008, deadline. This affects 650,000 port workers. In addition, the legislation enhances oversight of TWIC by requiring reports to Congress and the GAO on ongoing program implementation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> requires the establishment of an additional maritime security response team. Currently there is only one in the Nation, and it is based on the east coast. It makes sense to have a second one, because, of course, there are plenty of people on the west coast, and we need it.</paragraph>

Coast Guard ALJs have substantial expertise in fair adjudication of security programs. NTSB ALJs do not have the expertise in transportation security matters."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>U.S. Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard,   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 23, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN OBERSTAR: On April 18, the Committee filed with the Rules Committee an amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, that would be retitled the "Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2008." During numerous meetings and staff-level discussions over several months, we have described how a number of provisions that appear in this amendment would compromise organizational efficiency and operational effectiveness, diminish my command and control, and ultimately reduce the  Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out its safety, security, and stewardship missions. We have expressed these and other concerns in Department of Homeland Security views letters concerning earlier bill language. The amendment also contains provisions neither previously shared nor discussed with the Coast Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One provision requiring that the Coast Guard provide security around liquefied natural gas terminals and tankers is contrary to the existing assistance framework, at odds with accepted risk management practices, and would divert finite Coast Guard assets from other high-priority missions. I recommend a broader' discussion of security measures for all extremely hazardous cargoes. In the Statement of Administration Policy on <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Administration has stated that, if the bill is presented  to the President with this provision, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the others is one that, while similar to the Administration's proposal, fails to authorize the President to appoint officers to positions of importance and responsibility to accommodate organizational change in the future (Admirals and Vice Admirals). Others, primarily involving our important marine safety mission, would statutorily fix the designation and duties of other senior Coast Guard officials and officials at all levels of command, and prescribe inflexible personnel qualification  requirements. Still other provisions would diminish the Coast Guard's capacity to adjudicate merchant mariner licensing matters efficiently and effectively and support other vital security adjudications of the Department of Homeland Security (Appeals to National Transportation Safety Board). Still more provisions</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the new provisions is one that dramatically alters admission procedures for the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. While I have discussed Academy admissions several times with Chairman Cummings and we agree that our process should yield successful cadets and reflect our diverse society, the proposed Congressional nomination process deserves full discussion and deliberate consideration. Other new provisions that affect how we execute our missions deserve similar scrutiny. Conversely, the bill omits  the Administration proposal for much needed enhanced authority to prosecute those who would smuggle undocumented aliens into the United States by sea (Maritime Alien Smuggling Law Enforcement Act) and the Administration's proposal to protect seafarers who participate in investigations and adjudication of environmental crimes or who have been abandoned in the United States (Protection of and fair treatment of seafarers).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last year in the course of hearings, personal meetings with you, and regional forums with industry, as well as in my public statements, I have assured you and the public that we share a common objective: a robust marine safety program suited to meet the evolving demands of industry and the marine public. I am already taking aggressive steps to right the balance between our marine safety mission and our other vital responsibilities, and improve the effectiveness, consistency, and responsiveness  of our marine safety program, consistent with the framework I presented to you last September. Legislation such as the provisions I describe above was unnecessary to start this process. As I have stated on several occasions. I am the Commandant and am accountable to you to produce the changes needed to improve program performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Including these provisions and others in an Authorization Act that would otherwise be welcome compels me to strongly oppose the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, </paragraph>

    <paragraph>April 15, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR ADMIRAL ALLEN: We are sending you this letter to express our gratitude for the personal attention you have given Coast Guard's Marine Safety program the past several months. Industry and Congressional concern for Coast Guard performance of this vital mission needed addressing from the top. Your personal outreach to the stakeholders as well as the plans your staff developed to improve the program are making a difference. We fully support the Marine Safety Enhancement Plan delivered  to Congress on September 25, 2007. This plan appropriately targets the concerns that have been voiced by both industry and Coast Guard members, and we are seeing progress towards addressing those concerns. We have also been closely following the Coast Guard's historic modernization efforts. Your Headquarters organization modernization plan provides the appropriate level of focus and visibility to implement the marine safety program enhancements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We fully support Congressional commitment to hold the Coast Guard accountable for mission performance in Marine Safety, as in all other missions. At the same time, we believe that you need to have maximum flexibility in managing Coast Guard forces to achieve mission success. To achieve that degree of flexibility, the Coast Guard should continue its integrated approach to maritime safety, security, and stewardship to ensure our country's Marine Transportation System (MTS) operates safely and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, we applaud the Coast Guard and the Administration's request for additional resources to address Marine Safety mission requirements. By increasing capacity and expertise, the Coast Guard will be able to keep stride with the rapidly growing MTS and provide the level of services that maritime stakeholders expect and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We stand ready to assist in achieving the Coast Guard's Marine Safety goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I support <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, not only for what it does to enhance port security, but also for what it does to get the Deepwater program back on course. As someone who cares about the Coast Guard, it has been disturbing to see the mismanagement of the Deepwater program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, a $24 billion effort to modernize the Coast Guard's fleet has suffered delays, cost increases and design flaws that ultimately culminated in the idling of eight patrol boats. By the time that these problems were discovered by both the Inspector General of DHS and the Comptroller General, $88 million had been wasted. Both Federal watchdogs have said that program failures were due to the excessive leeway given the program contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> includes provisions that protect American taxpayers by forcing the Coast Guard to, for the first time, manage this contract. Regrettably, the administration in its Statement of Administration Policy denounced the Deepwater provision, which, incidentally, was approved by the House on a vote of 426-0 on July 23, 2007. We cannot allow the Coast Guard to continue on a poorly navigated course. <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> will steer the Deepwater procurement process in the right direction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I applaud the many improvements that this legislation will make to Federal policy in protecting our coastal environment, strengthening security in our Nation's ports, and providing the tools and resources necessary for rapid emergency response and coordination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The collision of a containership with the San Francisco Bay Bridge near my district, and the resulting oil spill that spread throughout the Bay, raised many questions about maritime policy in our Nation's coastal waters and ports. Commendably though, the committee field hearing examining the Federal response to the oil spill also provided potential answers to these questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to see that many important provisions were included in <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> to improve our water vessel traffic systems, sharpen incident response, and tighten environmental and security requirements. <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> will mandate double hulls for new container vessels with large oil capacities, reducing the risk of spills and contamination, and protecting animals, plant life, and local economies from the harmful impact of such disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also strongly support the provision added by my colleague, Rep. Tauscher, which authorizes the Coast Guard to issue regulations  that require bar pilots to carry portable navigational devices when they are navigating large container and tanker ships. These portable devices provide pilots accurate and necessary information to safely navigate their ships, and are critical to preventing future accidents like the one that occurred in the San Francisco  Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a longtime advocate of bringing common sense to our national security priorities, I am also pleased to acknowledge the important steps this legislation takes to securing our ports and the safety of communities that live around them. <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> takes critical steps to safeguard nuclear materials by establishing a pilot program to employ preventive radiological/nuclear detection equipment on Coast Guard vessels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that many States, including California, have been at the forefront of efforts to more effectively protect and manage our coastal waters. For instance, the Port of Oakland in my district was the first port in the United States to require that ships exchange their ballast water with seawater before entering the bay--a regulation that is now widely considered a critical measure of defense against invasive and non-indigenous species. Moving forward, we must work  to ensure States can successfully complement Federal regulations in the future, to enhance coordination, and to provide a more comprehensive policy for protecting our waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am also pleased that this bill will support Coast Guard efforts to diversify its workforce, by helping to build valuable partnerships between the Coast Guard and minority serving institutions. In 2006, just 16 percent of the Coast Guard Officer Candidate School graduates were minorities. Programs such as the Minority Serving Institution Management Internship Program, will recruit students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal  colleges, among others, and help to develop a new and diverse generation of civilian managers and Coast Guard Officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The establishment of a Coast Guard Laboratory of Excellence-MSI Cooperative Technology Program at three minority-serving institutions will assist in modernizing the Coast Guard's security programs while increasing the number of minority graduate degree holders in science, engineering, mathematics, and information technology--all fields that are critical to the mission of the Coast Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I stand in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007. This bill has many provisions which will improve homeland security, ensure safe navigation and enhance shipping reliability, among other measures. However, I would particularly like to draw my colleagues' attention to the ballast water protections in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member who hails from the Great Lakes State, I am perhaps more familiar than most with the havoc invasive species can reap on our waterways. I would note that in its 2005 report, the Great Lakes Collaboration stated that the world's greatest freshwater lakes are "succumbing to an irreversible `invasional meltdown' that may be more severe than chemical pollution." There are currently 185 invasive species in the Great Lakes and another is discovered, on average, every 28 weeks!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Invasive species cost the Federal Government about $1.3 billion per year and it is estimated that 42 percent of plants and animals on the Threatened and Endangered Species List are at risk because of alien species. Aquatic invasives pose a particular threat because of their ability to spread quickly through connected waterways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ballast water, which is used to stabilize freighters, is taken on board before a voyage begins. It can often contain organisms which become invasive species when released in navigable waters. For the reasons outlined above, ballast water represents a significant threat to our Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To its credit, the National Park Service has already taken steps to prevent ballast water from spreading a deadly fish virus known as VHS in Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. But much more must be done to protect the Great Lakes and other waterways from the exotic species contained in ballast water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> takes these necessary steps. This legislation for the first time creates strong ballast water management treatment standards in statute and requires that ballast water treatment technology be installed on board beginning next year. In addition, the bill requires all discharged ballast water to be thoroughly treated and implements tougher standards beginning in 2012, with a goal of zero species in discharged water by 2015. The manager's amendment to the bill also includes clarifying  provisions to ensure that ballast water management activities are properly reported, so that freighters can be held accountable for complying with the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR, for his hard work on this important legislation. We in the Great Lakes region are lucky to have one of our own, the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota, overseeing these matters. I urge all of my colleagues to support this critically important bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this Coast Guard Authorization Bill being considered on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the unique pleasure of representing over 265 miles of pristine Florida coastline--from Miami Beach to Key West. In fact, two of the largest Coast Guard Sectors in the United States, Sector Miami commanded by Captain Karl Schultz and Sector Key West commanded by Captain Scott A. Buschman are located in my Congressional district. As such, ensuring that the brave Coast Guard men and women have the tools they need to effectively patrol our coasts is of utmost concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that with this important mission, my constituents would not be pleased to hear of the lack of state-of-the-art equipment that the Coast Guard has been using to accomplish its goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to highlight the nature of our aging Coast Guard fleet, I can point to the oldest cutter still active. The Storis, still serving today in Alaska, was commissioned before the United States entry into World War II. A ship over 65 years old should not be tasked with protecting against the modem threats that face this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compare this to an April 18th article in the St. Petersburg Times where Drug Enforcement Agency officials are quoted as "scratching their heads over how to combat the latest innovation in drug smuggling: radar-dodging semisubmersible vessels packed with tons of cocaine." Determined drug smugglers are using very sophisticated ships and technologies in this cat-and-mouse game and it will become increasingly difficult to prevent their illegal activities if we are not able to modernize our fleet  as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, a vital portion of this bill is dedicated to the Coast Guard's Integrated Deepwater System. This is a critical program to modernize and replace the Coast Guard's aging ships and aircraft. The Deepwater Program is the largest acquisition in the history of the Coast Guard and any delay in the passage of this bill would have a serious and negative impact on the security of South Florida and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can all agree that these brave men and women deserve the fundamental resources they need. Certainly, without adequate funding the Coast Guard will not be equipped to accomplish their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coast Guard Sector Miami is scheduled to receive the first six Fast Response Cutters in addition to three ISLAND Class patrol boats. As well, Coast Guard Sector Key West is scheduled for delivery of the second six Fast Response Cutters in addition to one ISLAND Class patrol boat. I applaud these efforts and look forward to the continuation of the Deepwater Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though this bill is by no means perfect, the urgency of modernizing our fleet and putting these ships in the water and these aircraft in the skies cannot be understated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to recognize the crucial need to protect our Nation by strengthening the United States' oldest continuous seagoing service, the United States Coast Guard.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank both the Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Chairman OBERSTAR, and especially the Chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Chairman CUMMINGS, for their leadership in crafting this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always been a strong supporter of the Coast Guard and providing it with the resources necessary to protect our Nation's coasts, ports and waterways, particularly the Port of Houston which I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> is also important to me because it contains provisions relating to the security of vessels and facilities that transport or process Liquefied Natural Gas--or LNG--in the United States. Demand for clean-burning natural gas is building up across our economy, and energy proposals Congress has passed and is currently considering will only accelerate this demand. I believe all of us here agree on the need to ensure the safety of LNG shipments to the U.S., but Congress should do so in a responsible  way that does not unnecessarily impede future shipments of this clean-burning fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman CUMMINGS understood these concerns and included new language that would maximize the resources available to the Coast Guard for enforcing LNG security zones; maintain the multi-mission function of the Coast Guard; and mitigate bureaucratic hurdles in the LNG security process. While not perfect,  these changes are an improvement from the original bill and reflect a more workable approach than first proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank my good friends Chairman CUMMINGS and Chairman OBERSTAR for working with me and other Members to consider America's need for both energy security and homeland security when crafting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. This is a good bill in many ways. I particularly appreciate the bills' emphasis on holding the Coast Guard accountable for the funds the service receives from us, the Congress. The well-documented problems with the Deepwater program make it clear that more, needs to be done to ensure the Coast Guard's procurement policies are producing results. This is not just a budget issue, although that is certainly  important, but it is also a national security issue. We depend on the men and women serving in the Coast Guard to defend our Nation's waterways, and for that critical task they need new ships and aircraft. Congress can no longer stand by while billions of dollars are wasted on a program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of important language in Chairman Oberstar's manager's amendment to <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. This amendment is critical for my constituents who live in the Greenpoint area in Brooklyn. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and others on the Committee who saw the need for this language, and were willing to act on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important amendment directs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a follow up study on the Newtown Creek oil spill. The new EPA study builds upon my earlier effort with my distinguished colleague, Mr. Weiner, to get the EPA to issue a comprehensive report on the oil spill. That earlier report by the EPA, issued last fall, was an important step forward but it raised as many questions as it answered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is appropriate that we are considering this issue on a Coast Guard bill. It was the Coast Guard, nearly 30 years ago, that discovered the Newtown Creek oil spill in Greenpoint. The spill is massive, and scientists lack accurate measurements of the scope and impact of the whole of the plume. That's why we need a full site characterization of the Creek, so we know just what is in, around and underneath the Creek bed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basic condition of the Creek was not comprehensively addressed in the earlier report. It's past time for a full site characterization of Newtown Creek. The goal not merely oil plume containment, but plume removal. We must help give this important waterway safely back to the community, for its use and enjoyment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also am deeply concerned about what threat this material poses to the public. A full site characterization should also allow us to better measure the public health impact of the oil spill. Residents in this part of Brooklyn suffer from asthma, emphysema and bronchitis at a 25 percent higher rate than the rest of the city. Child asthma hospital admissions are especially high. A full site characterization can help public health professionals draw conclusions about the impact of the oil spill  on the health of the local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Weiner for his long-term partnership and hard work in addressing the serious public policy problem posed by the Newtown Creek Oil Spill. I would urge the EPA to seize upon these clear instructions from Congress, and help New York understand just what it is facing at Newtown Creek. Only a full site characterization can accomplish this worthy goal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2008. Among the many important provisions of this bill is one that is particularly needed to help ensure that our coastwise laws are properly and promptly enforced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 220 of the manager's amendment recognizes the importance of vigorous enforcement of our Nation's coastwise laws by expanding the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement authority to include the Coast Guard in addition to Customs and Border Protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In keeping with this important objective we hope that the Administration will make good on the effort that was begun last November with the publication of a proposed interpretive rule designed to address evasion by foreign cruise lines of one of our coastwise laws, the Passenger Vessel Services Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have written to Secretary Michael Chertoff urging prompt implementation of a modified rule that addresses concerns raised during the comment process while ensuring that the coastwise laws are properly enforced. My letter details the frustration of important Congressional objectives that will result if the rule is not implemented and I ask that a copy be included in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 31, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. SECRETARY: Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") proposed an interpretive rule regarding "Hawaiian Coastwise Cruises" on November 21, 2007. Since issuing the notice and accepting comments on the proposal, no final action has been taken to protect the only oceangoing U.S.-flag cruise ships in operation from unfair foreign competition. As a result, it has been announced that a second U.S.-flag cruise ship will be leaving Hawaii service and the U.S. registry in May 2008. I write  today to urge the Department to immediately adopt a Hawaii specific rule in order to ensure that the remaining U.S.-flag cruise ship does not have the same fate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 21, 2007, I joined the Hawai'i Congressional delegation and also offered separate comments of my own with respect to the proposed criteria to be used by CBP to determine whether non-coastwise-qualified passenger vessels are in violation of the Passenger Vessel Services Act ("PVSA") (46 U.S.C. 55103) and the Hawaii Cruise Ship Initiative enacted in 2003 (Pub. L. 108-7) when engaging in Hawaii cruise itineraries that include a "sham" foreign port stop of as little as an hour in  the middle of the night to cleanse the voyage and avoid the application of U.S. laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the preamble to the interpretive rule accurately states, "The intent of the maritime cabotage laws, including the PVSA, was to provide a `legal structure that guarantees a coastwise monopol to American shipping and thereby promotes development of the American merchant marine' ". I strongly support the PVSA, and was a primary sponsor of the subsequently enacted 2003 Hawaii Cruise Ship Initiative. I also strongly believe that CBP must take steps to vigorously enforce the PVSA, including adoption  of the proposed interpretive rule for Hawaii. But I am concerned that CBP's effort to do so may unnecessarily slow implementation of the interpretive rule by needlessly</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBP's proposed interpretive rule is unnecessarily expansive. It goes beyond what is necessary to achieve the economic and national security policy objective of the PVSA and the 2003 Hawaii Cruise Ship Initiative. In fact, I believe a reasonable interpretation under those laws would limit the scope of proposed interpretation to Hawaii because it would further those important public policy goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the vast majority of the opposition to CBP's proposed interpretation is based on the far reaching nature of the proposal. As a result, comments have been received from interested parties as far away from Hawaii as Maine and Florida who have understandably expressed concerns about the potential impact of the proposal on foreign cruise ships operating in areas where no oceangoing U.S. flag ships call. MARAD and CBP identified a specific and intentional effort to circumvent the PVSA on Hawaii  cruises. Under the authorities provided by the PVSA and the 2003 Hawaii Cruise Ship Initiative, the final remedy proposed by CBP should be limited to addressing that specific issue in the Hawaii market where U.S. flag ships operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the 2003 Hawai'i Cruise Ship Initiative requires that the affected U.S. flag ships identified in this proposed interpretation be in "regular service" in Hawai'i and explicitly prohibits their operation in coastwise service in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea, areas where interested parties have raised concerns about the application of the proposal. For these reasons, I strongly recommend that CBP issue a proposed PVSA interpretation limited to Hawai'i as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBP interprets a Hawai'i cruise itinerary to be "solely to one or more coastwise ports" even where it stops at a foreign port, unless the stop at the foreign port is a legitimate object of the cruise. CBP will assume that a stop at a foreign port is not a legitimate object of the cruise unless:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. The amount of time at the foreign port is more than 50 percent of the total amount of time at the Hawai'i ports of call; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The passengers are permitted to go ashore temporarily at the foreign port.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, CBP proposes to adopt an interpretive rule under which it will presume that any Hawai'i cruise itinerary that does not include a foreign port of call that satisfies each of these two criteria constitutes coastwise transportation of passengers in violation of 19 CFR 4.80a(b)(1).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for considering my views on this important matter. I firmly believe that if CBP acts on the proposed rule as I have recommended, many of the concerns expressed by commenters in this docket will be alleviated, while at the same time ensuring the protection of the very oceangoing U.S.-flag cruise ships intended by the PVSA and the 2003 Hawaii Cruise Ship Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this critical legislation is replete with numerous provisions that would make a variety of necessary changes to the Coast Guard's operations, I would like to focus on the portion of the bill that would regulate ballast water, which is of particular importance to northeast Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my constituents know, ballast water is an easy way for invasive species to enter the Great Lakes. These species quickly take root and displace native species to the detriment of local environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also serious economic consequences associated with attempting to manage and control these aquatic invaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Great Lakes, it is estimated that roughly $5 billion in damages has been caused by the zebra mussel; while the cost of lost native species may never be known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, there is an enormous recreational cost associated with the loss of fish and wildlife in the Great Lakes, which account for nearly 22 percent of the world's fresh surface water. They are a tremendous and extraordinary natural resource that we cannot afford to harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Mr. Oberstar for his leadership on this issue, and for including in his manager's amendment the requirement that each vessel provide monthly reports on ballast operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This prerequisite will allow for greater transparency in ballast management, and will sanction early detection of invasive species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also encouraged that <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> permits alternative ballast management measures for recreational vessels. In establishing rules for recreational vessels, I hope the Secretary recognizes that local boaters and fishermen should not be subjected to unreasonable overregulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would urge all my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to rise in support of language I included in the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I have consistently fought for boating safety for the last three years in memory of my constituent Brianna Lieneck who died in August of 2005. Her parents came to me after losing their daughter. They have made it their mission to fight for boating safety and to make the water safer for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their daughter Brianna an 11-year-old girl from my district who was tragically taken from us three years ago during a boating accident on the Great South Bay. The accident occurred on August 17, 2005 when a boat collided with their own. The operator of the other boat was reckless and there was poor visibility from the lack of lighting on the water that late at night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we can't bring back Brianna I have made it a priority to fight or mandatory boater education. And I want to commend Brianna's parents for taking this horrible tragedy and using it to fuel such a worthy cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> This year the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act will include language mandating that the Coast Guard find the best and most feasible ways to establish mandatory boater education for all states and report back to Congress within 6 months. This is an important first step in boating safety because education directly translates to safer waters. The Coast Guard estimates that 70 percent of reported fatalities occur when a boat operator has not received boating safety instruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> So many careless accidents can be avoided by taking one simple course and being more informed on the water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Boating accidents claimed 710 lives in 2006 and caused 3,474 injuries. Of that, 14 deaths and 100 injuries occurred in New York State in 2006. There were a total of 152 boating accidents in the state of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> There has been no significant decrease in the number of boating deaths since 1996 and the number increased between 2003 and 2006. This is unacceptable. If one simple course will decrease the number of deaths and injuries on the water, it is so important that we do everything in our power to require mandatory boater education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> You must take a driving test before you are able to operate a car. You should, at the very least, be required to take an education course to operate a boat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> And we owe it to the memory of Brianna and other victims in the Nation to do all we can to prevent future fatalities on the water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I would like to thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Ranking Member MICA for allowing this language to be included in the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400426" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the House has under consideration the bill <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2007. Mr. Chairman, I want to highlight an amendment that I offered which has been included in Chairman OBERSTAR's amendment before the House. It directs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study of the Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York underground oil spill at Newtown Creek.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newtown Creek is a 3.5 mile-long waterway that flows from the East River and separates the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. It is the single most polluted waterway in New York City, a legacy left by more than a century of heavy industrial activity. The creek's banks are home to the largest oil spill in the United States, which dates back to the 1950s and is estimated to be 150 percent of the size of the Exxon-Valdez spill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1978, a Coast Guard patrol detected petroleum on the surface of Newtown Creek and identified a spill that spreads from the banks of the creek through the Greenpoint neighborhood in Brooklyn. Evaluations at that time identified a spill totaling 17 million gallons attributed to refineries operated along the banks of the creek by the predecessors to ExxonMobil, BP/Amoco and Chevron-Texaco. To date, 9.4 million gallons have been cleaned, primarily conducted by ExxonMobil under a 1990 consent agreement  with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that sets no timetable for completion and includes no meaningful criteria for compliance. Estimates indicate that it will take until at least 2026 to finish the remediation, almost 50 years since we discovered the spill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, even though it has been 30 years since the oil spill was detected, the best information on the spill's size are estimates. While we have evidence that the spill is 17-30 million gallons, covering 55 to 70 acres, the full-extent of the spill remains unknown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This information is critical. More than 200 observation wells and 35 recovery wells have been installed since 1978, but until we know the full extent of the problem, we may be wasting time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency to revisit the findings of the United States Coast Guard's July 1979 report entitled "Investigation of Underground Accumulation of Hydrocarbons along Newtown Creek." The 2006 study did not collect new data, determine the size or location of the spill, or conclusively assess its impact on public health and safety. It recommended reevaluating the entire plume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given this, the provision included in Chairman OBERSTAR's amendment instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a full-site characterization of the Greenpoint, Brooklyn underground oil spill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This study is to be driven by the collection of new field evidence and will not be limited to the review or co-review of existing or scheduled data collection by private parties or state and municipal entities. This new evidence includes the collection of data from new product, groundwater and soil monitoring wells, as well as from existing groundwater and soil monitoring wells at the Greenpoint Oil Spill site. This site is loosely bound by Newtown Creek on the northeast, the Brooklyn-Queens  Expressway on the east and south, North Henry Street on the west, and Greenpoint Avenue on the north.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the full-site characterization is to include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of the free-product plume, or the portion of the underground petroleum plume that floats on top of the site's groundwater in its refined state or crude state, including any historic remnants currently distinct or fragmented from current spill delineations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of the dissolved phase of the plume, or the portion of the underground petroleum plume that has dissolved into the groundwater, including the geographic extent and concentrations of groundwater contamination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of soil contamination, including current and historic smear zones, or the area of soil contamination that may exist within the zone of horizontal and vertical water table fluctuations that have occurred since the time of the petroleum release.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the full extent of soil vapor contamination, including vertical and horizontal pathways within the vadose zone, or the area between the land surface and the water table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The evaluation of the entire spill area, covering both the free-product and dissolved plume, using three-phase numerical modeling techniques simulating the movement and interaction of water, oil, and vapor in a geologic medium, and use of such model to make an estimate on the length of time that will be required to recover free product, contaminated groundwater and contaminated soil from the underground plumes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation and collection of data on monthly groundwater levels over a representative area of the free product and dissolved phase contamination areas to establish background water levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on current and historic groundwater pathways in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on the impact of tidal fluctuations on groundwater levels in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation, collection, and analysis of data on seepage of free product and dissolved phase groundwater into Newtown Creek along the full spill area shoreline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chemical analysis and description of the oil product in the Newtown Creek region in its free product phase, its dissolved phase, and its smeared phase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An investigation of reports of oil in building foundations in the area of Roebling Street and North Eleventh Street in Brooklyn, New York, to determine whether those oil pockets are distinct from the Greenpoint Oil Spill, are historic remnants of the Greenpoint Oil Spill, or remain hydrologically connected to the Greenpoint Oil Spill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A detailed, three-dimensional representation reflecting the latitudinal and longitudinal location of the oil spill in the Newtown Creek region and also the observed and corrected thickness of the spill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A revised estimate of the volume and area of the spill in its three phases: free product, polluted groundwater, and smeared soils, and evaluate the remaining plume volume using corrected product thickness values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no geographic limit to the study. Testing is to be performed at potential, historic migration pathways and currently or newly detected product and groundwater contamination areas near the Greenpoint oil spill. The study will begin with areas to the north, south, southeast, and east of the current published spill location. Emphasis is to be placed on the path the spill may have taken when it was subject to hydrologic pressures related to groundwater withdrawals in the early-to-mid part  of the 20th Century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As outlined in the amendment, this study is to be completed no later than one year after enactment of this law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to express my thanks to Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman CUMMINGS for their willingness to work with me on this project. Furthermore, I would like to commend Mrs. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ, who represents the people of Greenpoint, and has worked closely with me on this initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I would like to thank the staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittees on Water Resources and Environment and Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, particularly Ryan Seiger, John Cullather, Lucinda Lessley, and Ben Webster, who have worked with me to address this critical, but often overlooked, issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to thank Riverkeeper Incorporated, and its chief investigator, Basil Seggos. This organization's dedication and advice on remediating the Newtown Creek oil spill over the last six years has been an invaluable asset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I'd like to thank Dori Friedberg of my staff for her time, work, and counsel on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their hard work shepherding through the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2007, and express my strong support for this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Coast Guard Authorization Act. In particular, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation's ballast water treatment requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Lakes are one of this nation's crown jewels. They are the most unique set of freshwater lakes in the world. They provide drinking water for millions. They provide habitat for our fisheries and they offer tremendous recreational and tourism opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Lakes are threatened by damaging aquatic invasive species that arrive in the Lakes at a rate of one every eight months. The communities I represent have first-hand experience of the devastation these aquatic invaders can cause. In the mid-1980s, the zebra mussel was brought to the Great Lakes by hitching a ride on an ocean vessel from Europe. They were first identified in Lake St. Clair in 1988, and since then the zebra mussels have spread throughout the Great Lakes and have made their  way into the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The economic and ecological costs of dealing with aquatic invasive species are staggering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Invasive aquatic species pose a clear and present danger to virtually every U.S. waterway and coastal area. Many more invasive species will arrive in rapid succession and spread within U.S. waters unless effective measures are taken to prevent them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before the House contains strong provisions to reduce and hopefully eliminate the spread of aquatic invasive species through ballast water. The bill establishes a national goal to eliminate invasive species from ballast water that is discharged into U.S. waters by the year 2015. As an interim step, the legislation requires all ships entering U.S. waters to conduct ballast water exchange at least 200 miles off the nation's coastline. Between now and the end of 2013, the legislation requires  vessels to be fitted with effective ballast water treatment equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this comprehensive response to one of the most serious problems confronting the Great Lakes and waterways across the nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act, as this is a necessary piece of legislation that is vital to our Nation's homeland security strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and indeed many in this body often talk about the need not to fall back into a pre-9/11 mindset when it comes to homeland security and I could not agree more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I want to start by thanking Homeland Security Committee Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON for all his work to strengthen the crucial port security aspects of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ever since 9/11 we have faced the fact that our Nation is vulnerable to possible terrorist attack by air, land and sea. In response our Nation's entire security apparatus has had to work harder and stretch their resources farther in order to be more responsive to these increased threats and few agencies have exemplified this more than the Coast Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation finally provides the resources necessary to ensure that the Coast Guard can successfully execute all its missions by authorizing the increase of their end-strength by 1,500 members to 47,000 and increasing funding to the Coast Guard to $8.4 billion, a full $200 million over the President's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this President and many of this body have objected to Section 720 of this bill which would strengthen security around liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals and tanker ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These terminals represent a critical piece of our energy infrastructure that could be attractive targets for attack, especially if we allow them to be built without any regard for our ability to secure them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without Section 720, we would certainly be guilty of maintaining a pre-9/11 mindset that says it's acceptable to maintain soft spots in our homeland security strategy and that is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we would all learn the lessons of 9/11 and support this legislation in full instead of trying to weaken our comprehensive homeland security strategy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The manager's amendment authorizes the Coast Guard to delegate to classification societies the Coast Guard's authority for safety plan review and construction inspections of offshore oil structures. It allows this authority to be delegated to foreign classification societies to the extent that the government of the country in which the classification society is headquartered accepts documents prepared by our classification society, the American Bureau of Shipping, on behalf of the leaseholder,  and does not limit the ABS to this process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The Tauscher amendment requires federally licensed pilots to use portable electronic devices with navigational charts capable of being connected to an Automatic Identification System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sanchez amendment requires the Superintendent of the Coast Guard to prescribe a policy on sexual harassment and sexual violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kind amendment deals with monthly ballast water treatment reports to the Secretary, requiring them. In addition, the amendment provides that no-ballast-on-board vessels will be required to conduct ballast water treatment, when applicable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bordallo amendment requires Coast Guard vessels homeported in Guam to be repaired at shipyards in the U.S., including Guam shipyards. The same requirement applies to all other Coast Guard cutters homeported elsewhere in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Weiner amendment requires the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study on health, safety and environmental concerns related to an underground petroleum spill on the Brooklyn, New York, shoreline.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as you know, during the consideration of this measure before the Rules Committee, I offered several amendments related to discharges from recreational vessels. Those amendments were not made in order under the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am still concerned about the impact the proposed regulations may have on more than 16 million recreational boaters in the United States. At the Rules Committee, you were more than gracious in suggesting that we would work together to develop legislation, hold hearings in the committee and move legislation quickly to the House on this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask the chairman, and in saying this I also want to give a tip of the hat to Candice Miller of Michigan, who has been a real champion on this issue as well, but I would ask the chairman if you would be willing to work with us to bring legislation to the House floor and to get it prompt consideration, as this deadline is now approaching in September?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>My amendment will require the United States Coast Guard Academy to establish comprehensive policies, training programs, surveys and reports on sexual harassment and sexual violence involving cadets or Academy personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, I added a similar amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill to require the military academies under the Armed Services Committee jurisdiction to establish the same types of policies, and I am pleased that this amendment will ensure that all of our military service academies are treated the same; that they all have plans to prevent sexual assault, and that we know the incidents and allegations of sexual assault and that we know how to handle them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also requires the academies to conduct surveys to get feedback on sexual harassment and sexual violence in the workplace, and this amendment will help to reduce the incidents of sexual assault and it will make our academies safer environments.</paragraph>

And I do commend my colleague, Ms. Sanchez, for her hard work on this  issue. As a member of the Naval Academy Board of Visitors, this is an issue that I have worked on very hard, not only there, but with regard to our Coast Guard Academy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would also allow the Coast Guard to delegate some regulatory functions, including facility inspections regarding offshore facilities, to classifications societies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the amendment would authorize the Coast Guard to issue regulations to require a pilot to carry on board the vessel he or she is operating a computer equipped with electronic charts of the navigation areas the vessel will transit.</paragraph>

  <chair>Part B amendment No. 2 offered by Mr. LaTourette:</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I indicated during the opening remarks general debate on this bill that this is an amendment which I cosponsored with Representative Boustany, and it would authorize the Coast Guard to consider qualified State and local security assets, personnel and resources, made available to a liquefied natural gas terminal when determining whether security resources are available to carry out necessary security measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This language carries out an agreement that was developed in a colloquy with Chairman Cummings during our subcommittee's and the full committee's consideration of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, all of us want to ensure the highest levels of security at LNG terminals and other at-risk assets. This amendment would do that by leveraging the collective resources of Federal, State, local, and private sector officials. I urge all members to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I indeed support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio, who is our ranking member on the Coast Guard subcommittee, which he offers in conjunction with the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), also a very good friend and colleague and committee member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment addresses section 720 of the substitute regarding waterside security around LNG tankers and terminals. It provides that the Coast Guard may consider security assets and personnel provided by State and local officials who are contracted for or otherwise made available to an LNG terminal operator in determining whether security resources are available to carry out our waterside security measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard has, as we have so often discussed, limited resources to undertake its many missions. Partnering with State and local officials or contracted waterside security services will be in effect force multipliers for the Coast Guard. So we support that initiative.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, a valuable member of the full committee, subcommittee, and the former Chair of the Coast Guard Subcommittee, Mr. LoBiondo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. LoBIONDO. I want to thank Mr. LaTourette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Oberstar, let me thank you and Mr. Cummings for your very thoughtful approach to these critically important issues, and to Mr. Mica and Mr. LaTourette for your diligence in these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your consideration of this important issue, and Mr. LaTourette's thoughtful approach to making sure that we do not have a chilling effect on the future development of LNG in our country. It would effectively block the construction of a widely supported plant that is just north of my district that could definitely help provide much needed relief for home heating costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I believe would also have the potential to undermine our security by not the allowing the Coast Guard to determine the personnel and assets necessary to escort LNG shipments. This should be a decision by the Coast Guard. I believe they are best able to do this, and the LaTourette amendment represents a very reasonable and realistic compromise which will give the Coast Guard the flexibility they  need to ensure the security of LNG shipments as  well as to deal with the other potential threats in our ports and waterways. I strongly urge all members to support the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Subsection C of that section requires that, before the Coast Guard can approve a facility's security plan for a new LNG terminal, the service must determine that it has available to the sector in which the terminal is to be located the resources it needs to carry out the risk mitigation measures identified in the waterway suitability report for that terminal. This amendment would include State and local resources in the assessment, which is a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the adoption of this amendment and with the measures already included in subsection C, section 720, we will ensure that the Coast Guard's resources do not have to be diverted from other high-priority missions as determined by the commandant to secure LNG operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard will be able to depend upon those State and local law enforcement resources that have the proven training, resources, personnel, equipment, and experience necessary to combat a terrorist attack, to conduct waterborne patrols around LNG facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I emphasize that the State and local law enforcement cannot and should not be seen as replacements for the Coast Guard resources, as the Coast Guard is our Nation's maritime time security agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, having the Coast Guard, our trained maritime security agency, defend our communities from the risk of a terrorist attack on an LNG terminal in the neighborhood is not an unwarranted and unnecessary subsidy. As our Nation continues to approve new LNG terminals, we must commit to ensuring that all of the resources, particularly Coast Guard resources, necessary to secure these facilities are in place. I fully support the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 10 million Americans travel on cruise lines each year. Unfortunately, many are unaware that they are at risk of being victims of crime while on their vacations. And, it concerns me even more that these victims have inadequate access to assistance or law enforcement in the aftermath of a crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, the media has reported on a number of high-profile cases of passengers falling overboard, passengers going missing, and passengers being raped and sexually assaulted. Sadly, many of these cases remain unresolved, and the perpetrators of sexual violence and other violent crimes on cruise ships are rarely brought to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I became personally involved after a constituent of mine, Laurie Dishman, came to me for assistance after she had been a victim of a violent crime on a cruise ship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of continued cases of crimes on the high seas, and with the leadership of Chairman Cummings, this Congress has held two hearings on safety on cruise ships. We learned that we must take action to inform people of exposure to risk while on cruise vacations. Mr. Chairman, sometimes even cruise ships need sunshine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment seeks to do just that by requiring the Coast Guard to post on-line the number of deaths, missing persons, and reported crimes committed on cruise ships. The amendment also requires cruise lines to include a link to this data base on their public web sites. Our amendment would create transparency and promote a culture of accountability by allowing the public access to the number of crimes reported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prevention can be just as powerful as enforcement, and we all know that prevention starts with making people aware of the potential for a crime to occur. With prevention and enforcement, it is our hope that the tragic events that so many passengers have endured will not be repeated. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>The amendment of the gentlewoman arises out of a very tragic case on which the committee held an extensive hearing, and attempted to address the issue in language within the pending bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her amendment would go to the heart of this issue, establishing a Web site, updated quarterly, aggregated by cruise line, and providing a link to the site on their own Web site. These requirements will allow passengers to review the safety record of a cruise line before booking their cruise. I think that is a very important protection, especially for women who are often alone and can be subjected to violence, as we have seen in the course of these hearings. I support the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlelady from California for yielding, and I want to thank Ms. Matsui and her brave constituent, Laurie Dishman, for bringing this very important issue before Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year 10 million American citizens board cruise ships and sail from American ports. These cruise ships are floating cities. But unlike cities, there are no peace officers or properly trained security personnel to protect passengers on board these ships. There is really no oversight or accountability for the cruise industry to properly or timely report secret crimes that occur on ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment just requires the Coast Guard to publicly maintain and regularly update a numerical accounting of crimes and number of missing persons on each ship. This is commonsense. We value information on college campuses, and this Congress under the Cleary Act requires reporting of crimes on college campuses. But when there is a crime on the high sea, it is a public relations cover-up because of the travel industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will create a better-informed passenger and, of course, safer cruise ships.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguish Chair of the Rail Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to start out by thanking Chairmen OBERSTAR and CUMMINGS and Ranking Members MICA and LATOURETTE for all of their hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have given the Coast Guard so much responsibility, and they have been up to the challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have great respect for my colleague from California, but I rise to express my serious concern with her pending amendment. As a Member from the State of Florida, which has 14 ports and numerous cruise lines, I have a particular interest in the cruise industry. The cruise industry is one of the most important economic engines in the State of Florida. Over 5 million passengers embarked from Florida in 2005 and the industry contributed more than $6 billion in direct spending. In addition, the cruise  industry is the second largest employer for Florida, generating more than 125,000 jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before coming to Congress I owned a travel agency, and I can tell you that a cruise is one of the most cost-effective, safe and enjoyable vacations one can take. In fact, I recently sent my mother on a cruise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cruise industry is highly regulated by State, Federal and international laws. They ensure that passengers are safe and have a sound safety and security record. It is apparent from the FBI statistics that crime against U.S. passengers on cruise ships are very rare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed amendment would unfairly penalize the cruise industry and require the public posting of crime allegations, organized by the name of the cruise line. No other private industry is required to provide such information on an Internet site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill unfairly penalizes the cruise industry without any evidence or justification for this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring the reporting of allegations of crimes onboard ships would be misleading to the public as there is no distinction between an allegation and an actual crime committed. That is why if a local government requires the reporting of allegations of crime, no specific business is identified since in many instances these allegations are unfounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I will continue to work to make sure that the cruise industry is one of the safest industries in this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her very strong support and thoughtful work on this legislation, and I am proud to join Congresswoman Matsui and Congressmen SHAYS and POE on this amendment which would require the Coast Guard to maintain an online database about missing persons and alleged crimes committed on cruise ships and to require cruise lines to include a link to this database on their public Web sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like my good friend from Florida, I also represent many fine ports and many fine cruise lines that have taken steps to improve their procedures. But certainly individuals going on trips should know the track records of cruise lines, and know the steps they have taken to improve safety. The absolute most important part of a vacation is to make sure you have a safe, enjoyable time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense amendment, and it will provide the public with valuable information before booking their trips, as well as give an indication of where there are challenges in the industry and improvements that have taken place. I urge an "aye" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I had an experience with a constituent, George Smith, who was lost at sea on his honeymoon on board a cruise ship in the Mediterranean. We had hearings on this tragedy, and had people contact us with unbelievable stories of someone missing, the family never being notified, the cruise line taking the person's possessions and putting them in a lost-and-found and then selling them, of sexual assaults and thefts, and no information being provided about the crimes to the proper authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this language does, the Matsui amendment, requires the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to maintain a numerical account of missing persons and alleged crimes committed on cruise ships. The database will be updated quarterly and aggregated by the cruise line industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It requires cruise lines to include a link to this database on their public Web site. The public has a right to know about the exact circumstances that take place on board cruise ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a sensible amendment. It needs to pass. And I thank her for introducing it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a photograph regarding the amendment we will talk about this morning. These are mini-submarines. They are currently being made in the jungles of Colombia, alongside much of the drugs that they carry, probably from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia which is the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These vessels are made out of fiberglass. They are about 100-feet long. They carry a crew of five and up to 13 tons of drugs with a street value of about $300 million. They travel about 14 miles per hour, and they are barely below the surface. They are constructed to remain below the surface of the water, making them difficult for the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard to track. And they can travel all of the way from the north coast of South America to the southeastern United States without refueling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These vessels that the Coast Guard are encountering are stateless vessels with no legitimate use. They are built for stealth and the capability to rapidly scuttle the illicit drugs they are carrying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens is when the United States Coast Guard or the Navy comes upon one of these vessels, the crew scuttles the ship, it sinks, and all of the contraband sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The only one prosecution that has taken place, reflected here on the bottom, occurred when a bale of cocaine floated back to the surface. The five crewmen are now being prosecuted in Tampa, Florida. And let me mention that these vessels can not only be used for drugs, they can bring explosives into the  United States. They come up our waterways. They can attack crude ships, ships that are bringing in oil tankers, our military ships like the U.S.S. Cole, or even cruise ships, as we mentioned earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would simply state the findings of Congress that these stateless vehicles have no legitimate use on international waters, and the crew that is operating one of these is committing a Federal crime.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It will also alleviate the danger that is posed to our members of the Coast Guard in their attempt to retrieve the contraband that is thrown overboard when the perpetrators of these kinds of activities find that they are being chased by the Coast Guard. In this case, it will be illegal to be utilizing these kind of vessels for this type of purpose, but you will not have to prove the contraband actually is there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an effective means by which we are giving an additional tool to our Coast Guard men and women around the world, and also to our prosecutors, to ensure that we deal with the continuing problem of drug trade.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I'm very familiar with this issue, having been former ranking member of the Drug Subcommittee of the Government Reform Committee, and now chairman of this subcommittee.

    <paragraph>In August of last year, for instance, the Coast Guard and other Federal partners seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying cocaine estimated to be worth more than $350 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, by the way, Madam Chairman, I also note that this year the Coast Guard has taken in and seized more drugs than in any year in its history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who represents the City of Baltimore, I know firsthand the destruction that drugs can cause. And I know that every gram that is kept off our streets is a victory over the forces that destroy lives and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also know that the profit available from drug drives and smugglers, they continually try to come up with these new techniques, and this is our effort, Mr. Poe's effort to address this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Chairman, I wholeheartedly support this amendment. I want to thank Mr. Poe for sponsoring it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment because it strikes me as unconstitutional to make it a Federal crime to operate a submersible or semi-submersible vehicle that is not registered with a country if it navigates through international waters. I believe that this amendment, aside from being unconstitutional, is dangerously broad and may well lead to the persecution of individuals who are in no way engaging in illegal activity. I am concerned that this may lead to the  prosecution of, for example, a scientific organization that builds and operates a submersible research vessel and operates it in international waters. Are these organizations going to be forced to register their activities with the U.S. Government or face a 20 year jail term? The real intent of this</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, since the terrible events of September 11, 2001, we have relied heavily on the brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard to be our eyes and ears against terrorism along our coastal borders and at more than 300 of our Nation's ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard's homeland security mission isn't new. It began more than  200 years ago when the service was founded. Yet, today, we are more focused on the need to provide maritime security. The Coast Guard has ramped up its efforts to ensure that we don't allow people into this country who intend to do us harm or weapons to unleash upon us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have improved our ability to deal with potential terrorist threats, but we must keep up the progress. America's security is our paramount responsibility, and our goals must be always to counteract threats against our citizens, address the dangers posed by terrorists, and eliminate the potential for introduction of weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My congressional district is home to the Port of Stockton, one of the largest inland ports in the Nation. While it is an economic engine for California's Central Valley, moving everything from agricultural products to wind turbines, it may be viewed as a potential entry point for those who intend to do us harm. Thankfully, the Coast Guard understands the risk and provides constant security that insures continued business and peace of mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that it's important to highlight the dual responsibilities of the Coast Guard, and we should ensure that the Coast Guard's homeland security missions are not lessened by the licensing and regulatory functions of the Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is both simple and needed. It outlines formally that none of the changes to the marine safeguard mission of the Coast Guard shall impair in any way, the homeland security mission of the Coast Guard. It is important to note that we are not creating new authorizations. We are simply outlining formally the continued importance of protecting our waterways and ports, maintaining coastal security, and securing our borders against aliens seeking to unlawfully enter the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans deserve to know that our ports and waterways are protected. This amendment does just that by clarifying the Coast Guard's homeland security missions are strengthened by the legislation we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I consider all of my colleagues support for this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we are prepared to accept this amendment. The Coast Guard is a multi-mission military service that must have the ability and flexibility to respond to numerous concerns and threats in the maritime domain.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to congratulate Mr. McNerney, a new Member of the House, for bringing this amendment to the floor, bringing it to our attention.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was our purpose from the very outset of crafting the marine safety provisions of this bill to delineate clearly the responsibilities of the Coast Guard on safety, on its safety mission, and on the new emphasis within the Department o Homeland Security on their security responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, this was an issue, I would say to the gentleman from Ohio, that then Chairman Young and I raised with the President at the White House some 6 plus years ago when he first proposed the Department of Homeland Security, that the bill, as proposed, the proposition set forth by the administration, did not distinguish between search, rescue, safety responsibilities of the Coast Guard and these new emphasis duties on security. We do that now in this legislation. The amendment of the  gentleman from California will further delineate that distinction.</paragraph>

MARITIME BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commandant of the Coast Guard, shall conduct, in the maritime environment, a program for the mobile biometric identification of suspected individuals, including terrorists, to enhance border security and for other purposes.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Requirements.--The Secretary shall ensure the program required in this section is coordinated with other biometric identification programs within the Department of Homeland Security.</chair>
  <chair> (c) Cost Analysis.--Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations and Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Appropriations and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate an analysis of the cost of expanding the Coast Guard's biometric identification capabilities for use by the Coast Guards Deployable Operations Group, cutters, stations, and other deployable maritime  teams considered appropriate by the Secretary, and any other appropriate Department of Homeland Security maritime vessels and units. The analysis may include a tiered plan for the deployment of this program that gives priority to vessels and units more likely to encounter individuals suspected of making illegal border crossings through the maritime environment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, the term "biometric identification" means use of fingerprint and digital photography images.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to offer an amendment to the Coast Guard Authorization Act that will strengthen maritime security. My amendment would replace section 708 of the bill which incorporates language from a stand-alone bill I have introduced with tougher language that would codify and expand a Coast Guard pilot program to collect biometric information on aliens interdicted at sea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment requires the Coast Guard to move forward on this program within 1 year, and provide a cost  analysis to Congress on expanding these capabilities in other Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security vessels and units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of this analysis, my amendment would encourage DHS to give priority to expanding mobile biometric collection capabilities to assets and areas that are most likely to encounter illegal border crossings in the maritime environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The efforts of the Coast Guard in this area show great promise. Since the collection of limited biometrics on individuals interdicted at sea began, the Coast Guard has collected biometric data from 1,513 migrants resulting in nearly 300 matches against databases of wanted criminals, immigration violators, and others who have previously encountered government authorities. Instead of being released to repeat their dangerous and illegal behavior, these individuals are now detained and prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has prosecuted more than 118 individuals for violations of U.S. laws, immigration laws, and other offenses based substantially on information obtained through the biometrics program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard reports that illegal migration in the Mona Pass area, an area between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, has been reduced by 50 percent in the past year as a direct result of the biometrics program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By leveraging its relationships within DHS, the Coast Guard now has access to millions of fingerprint files it can use to positively identify individuals encountered at sea, those who are without identification and are suspected of attempting an illegality and illegally entering the United States. Now that the Coast Guard has determined the most effective way to collect biometrics at sea, the Department of Homeland Security needs to determine the most appropriate way to move forward and expand  this effort as cost effectively as possible, which is what my amendment requires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the success of existing efforts on biometrics by the Coast Guard, I believe it is imperative that we strengthen section 708 of the underlying bill on clarifying congressional intent in this area so that these efforts are cost effective and will do the most good. It is clear the collection of biometrics at sea by the Coast Guard is already helping greatly deter illegal migration and prevent the capture and release of dangerous individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the distinguished Members of this House to help further that effort by voting for this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment which requires biometric identification of suspected persons, including terrorists, to strengthen border security. Fingerprinting, digital photos, and other technology can be used to identify illegal migrants, smugglers, and terrorists. It will be useful in establishing a database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It parallels what we do in the TSA for aviation security and in other areas of security. It will be a valuable asset in the ongoing struggle against terrorism, and I appreciate the gentleman offering the amendment.</paragraph>

I have actually seen this procedure and have seen this biometric equipment in operation. This allows us to use our resources, our limited resources that the Coast Guard has, in an efficient and effective manner; and it also will allow  us to be able to learn exactly who these terrorists might be and get identification information on them immediately.</paragraph>
