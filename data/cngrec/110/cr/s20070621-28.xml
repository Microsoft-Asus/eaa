    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the privileges of representing Oregon in the U.S. Senate is having the honor of serving in the seat held for 30 years by Mark Hatfield. During his nearly half century of service to the people of Oregon as a State Representative, State Senator, Secretary of State, Governor, and U.S. Senator, Mark Hatfield earned a reputation for honesty and integrity. He also earned a reputation for having an outstanding staff--staff who often went on to outstanding careers in  public service in their own right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to pay tribute to one of the most distinguished of the "Hatfield Alumni," Warne Nunn, who passed away earlier this week in Oregon at the age of 86. Warne Nunn served as chief of staff to Mark Hatfield during his 8 years as Oregon's Governor, and when Oregonians sent Mark Hatfield to the U.S. Senate in 1966, Warne Nunn came east to help open up the Senate office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Nunn's heart, however, was in his beloved Oregon, and he soon returned home, where he was to make numerous positive contributions for four more decades. As a long-time executive with Pacific Power and Light, Warne Nunn was a respected leader in Oregon's business community. It was, however, through his philanthropic leadership where Warne Nunn left a legacy that should inspire us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a long-time member and chairman of the Willamette University Board of Trustees, Warne Nunn was a passionate advocate for quality education. His commitment to education could also be seen in the leadership he provided as a long-time trustee of the Meyer Memorial Trust, one of the largest and most generous philanthropies in the Pacific Northwest. During its 25-year history--throughout which Warne Nunn has served as a trustee or trustee emeritus--Meyer Memorial Trust has donated nearly $420 million  to countless worthy causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Hatfield once told me of a journey he made to the Calcutta slums with Mother Teresa. During that journey, Senator Hatfield asked Mother Teresa how she could go on day after day, knowing that for every life she touched, there were thousands of lost souls she would never reach. She responded by saying: "God does not call us to be successful. He calls us to be faithful."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no doubt that Warne Nunn lived a successful life. But his family and friends will tell you that more important to Warne was the fact that he lived a faithful life. He was a faithful husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was a faithful friend. He was a faithful businessman, public servant, and philanthropic leader. Above all, he was a faithful servant of God. I join many fellow Oregonians in paying tribute to the life and legacy of Warne Nunn, and in extending my  sincere condolences to his wife Delores and his entire family.</paragraph>
