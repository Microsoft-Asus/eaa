  <narrative>COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8400]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there was an energy bill brought to the floor yesterday, but unfortunately, it was not a comprehensive bill or open for debate, and no Member was allowed to offer any amendment expanding the scope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill passed restricts miles of coastal States like my State of South Carolina. It tells us what we can explore, and it prohibits the States from sharing any revenues. That's a bad deal for coastal States, and it's a bad deal for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It imposes a new 15 percent renewable energy requirement on utilities, but it leaves out energy sources like nuclear, most hydro and even clean coal. South Carolina gets about 50 percent of its power from nuclear energy, and this legislation will penalize my State. So it's a bad deal for South Carolina, and it's a bad deal for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what I also left out of this so-called comprehensive bill is coal-to-liquid technology, increased refinery capacity, domestic exploration in ANWR, and nuclear energy--our cleanest and safest supply of energy that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the bill passed is a bad deal for America. There is a smarter way. Let's bring comprehensive energy legislation like the American Energy Act to the floor.</paragraph>
