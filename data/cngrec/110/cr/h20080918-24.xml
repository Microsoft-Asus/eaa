    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the speaker just before me just admitted that the jobs that have been lost primarily have been lost while the Democrats have been in control of this Congress. They continue their assault on the American family with their energy bill, which doesn't help American families who are hurting at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new bill results in an $85 tax hike on consumers. Our constituents have been looking to us for relief. That bill does not bring the relief they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Skyrocketing gas prices have taken a dramatic toll on almost every area of our lives. Families have had to adjust by tightening budgets. Schools adjust by cutting field trips and textbook purchases. Small businesses are watching their profits shrink, while making tough decisions about expanding their company or being able to make their payroll. This is has all occurred under the Democrats' watch in the last 20 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Republican plan increases production of American-made energy in an environmentally safe way. It promotes new, clean and reliable sources of energy, while cutting red tape and increasing the supply of American-made fuel and energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican plan encourages greater energy efficiency by offering conservation tax incentives to Americans who make their home, car, and business more energy efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Republican plan helps American families combat the increase cost of energy. I invite my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in bringing real solutions to the energy crisis.</paragraph>
