    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our colleague from Texas, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, for introducing this important and timely legislation, and I look forward to hearing her remarks as we proceed with this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we speak, millions of our Muslim friends and neighbors around the world are in the midst of Ramadan, a holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal. The observance of Ramadan requires devotion to faith, community and family, truly universal values we all share. During the month of Ramadan, observant members of the Islamic faith fast from sunrise to sunset and focus their attention on the teachings of their religion as well as purity of thought and action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate and necessary for the U.S. House of Representatives to mark the commencement of this important event which began this year on September 13 and continues for one lunar month. This legislation expresses the deep respect we all feel for Muslims in the United States and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, unfortunately, peaceful patriotic members of the Islamic faith have been subject to hateful and demeaning threats, words, even acts of violence. This House must stand with these law-abiding citizens in this time of conflict. I strongly support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill>, which recognizes the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and expresses respect to Muslims in the United States and throughout the world on this occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarded as the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, Ramadan signifies a time of deep reflection for the 1.5 billion Muslims across the globe. During this month, special emphasis is put on prayer, giving to charity, daylight fasting, and self-examination and improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is tragic that radical Islamists have used selective interpretations of Islam to justify and encourage hate, injustice, oppression, violence, and terror. They have indoctrinated many young Muslims to hate and target for violence America, Israel, the West, other Muslims, and non-Muslims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Worse still, some have exploited the month of Ramadan, which should be devoted to spirituality and self-perfection, to stoke the fires of fanaticism and destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that a growing number of Muslims, including many in America, are rejecting radical Islam and its culture of death. Instead, they are articulating interpretations of Islam that embrace the values of human life, liberty, and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, today we are seeing a clash within Islamic civilization between those who wish to step into the light of progress and those who wish to return the entire world to the dark ages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the threat that radical Islam poses worldwide, the clash within Islamic civilization affects everyone throughout the world. That is why this House should take the opportunity to pass <bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill>. This resolution commends Muslims who reject interpretations of Islam that justify and encourage hatred, violence, and terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May Ramadan this year truly be a time when Muslims and people of all faiths embrace freedom and tolerance for all, and reject violence and extremism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend and distinguished colleague from Texas, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, for introducing this resolution; and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on September 13, 2007, Muslims in America and around the world celebrated the commencement of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. I'd like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Meek, Congressman Ellison and the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association for their continued support and leadership on this historic bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two best that I know are on my staff: my chief of staff, Murat Gokcigdem, a Turkish American; and Illham Jaffer, legislative assistant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill> recognizes Muslims around the world and commemorates them during their holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is observed in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Of the Abrahamic faiths, Islam is a faith that places great emphasis on knowledge; therefore, it is a faith of reason and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The month of Ramadan is a time of heightened spiritual awareness, family  bonding, communal service and worship, and self-renewal for Muslims everywhere. It is the month of fasting from sunrise to sunset for over 1 billion Muslims throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this month, Muslim Americans are appreciative of America's tradition of diversity. The community displays its appreciation by reconfirming its duty to ensure human dignity and a better future for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Muslim American community contributes to the vibrant growth of American society and culture. Muslim Americans play a significant role in our Nation's political process, economic growth, scientific development, free enterprise, religious tolerance, law enforcement and homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American pluralistic ideals, democratic institutions and multiculturalism are expanded and strengthened by the contribution of Muslim American civic participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this holy month, I'd like to say Ramadan Mubarak to all Muslims.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to a member of both the Committee on Ways and Means and the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill>, which recognizes the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I want to congratulate the sponsor, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. This is the first time in history that the United States Congress will commemorate and recognize the month of Ramadan, a month which Muslims have been observing for more than 1,300 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this month, I know that Muslims will fast from sunrise to sunset, but the month of Ramadan is about so much more than the act of abstaining from food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the month of Ramadan, Muslims will strive to become stronger in their faith and in their character. This means striving to be better members of our families and within our communities, striving to perform acts of charity for those who are less fortunate, striving to set a better example to those around us. In truth, it is a striving to become a more complete human being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this month should not just be important for Muslims. It should also be imperative for all of us non-Muslims to learn about this faith, which too often has been misunderstood and mischaracterized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Muslims share a great deal of commonality with other faiths. For example, the practice of fasting is not just done by Muslims but is also observed by Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and Hindus, among others. These United States of America, this is a Nation of God and all religions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the book of Exodus tells us that Moses fasted for 40 days and 40 nights while he was on the mountain with God, and the accounts of Matthew and Luke tell us that Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights while in the desert prior to the three temptations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've always been extremely fortunate to represent probably one of the most diverse districts in the entire country, the Eighth District of New Jersey. It has been through the many good works of my Muslim constituents that it has become clear to me that the true faith of Islam is one of peace and mutual understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite what others may say, we should have no qualms about electing a Muslim to any elected office in the United States, for our Nation was founded on the principle that there can be no religious test for holding office, only a test of that individual's character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all part of the beautiful tapestry that comprises our Nation, and Muslim Americans are starting to move to the forefront where they belong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish all Muslims in our Nation a happy and a blessed month of Ramadan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota, who serves with me on both the Financial Services Committee and the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Ellison.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for yielding time and for this excellent resolution. I'd like to thank all of the authors, including Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and everyone who signed on to the resolution commemorating the month of Ramadan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am celebrating Ramadan myself personally, and I have been doing so ever since my 19th birthday. I'm 44 now, and I can tell you that it is a time of reflection, a time of renewal, and regeneration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's true that we fast during the daylight hours during Ramadan, but it also says in the sayings of Prophet Mohammed, that if you do not refrain from ill speech, bad speech, bad words, basically a bad attitude and negative disposition, then God has no use of your refraining from food and drink. And so in this month of Ramadan, it's important to reassess your life, to contemplate your role in society and to benefit your neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's very important when we talk about "neighbor" that we reflect upon what that word really means, "neighbor." It was Jesus, who the Muslims call Esau and who they revere very highly, who told the lawyer in the Bible that his neighbor really wasn't even somebody of his own religion or his own tribe but really was that Samaritan from that other group who lended assistance and gave a helping hand when it was needed. And that is the origin of the story of the Good Samaritan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This idea of the neighbor is something that's very important in Islam, especially during Ramadan where Muslims of all faiths, all colors, all backgrounds, reach out to our neighbors, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist of all types.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to report to you, Mr. Speaker, that over the course of the last several weeks we've had several Iftar celebrations right here in the Capitol and also in the Pentagon and a tremendous demonstration of interfaith cooperation, interfaith working together and mutual respect and recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As was said earlier, and I quite agree, every faith tradition relies on fasting as a means for spiritual regeneration. I also want to report to you that on the date of Yom Kippur, which is the Jewish holiday of atonement and the commemoration of the time of the new year, that my mosque in Minneapolis and the synagogue Temple Israel in Minneapolis joined together to break fast together, and we ended up with a good problem, Mr. Speaker, and that is, that there were 150 people who RSVP'ed and said  they wanted to come. We ended up with about 160 people coming, and we didn't have enough chairs for everybody, but we had enough food because we shared it, Mr. Speaker, showing again that we're not too far apart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd also like to let you know that many of our Christian friends came to celebrate the breaking of the fast with the Muslims and Jews together, and we're really warmed and encouraged by the fact that we can all come together even though we have different faith traditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, let me again thank the wonderful, excellent commemoration we're having today as a true expression of American values, religious tolerance, inclusion of everyone.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a longtime advocate and friend of the Muslim-American community, I am pleased to support <bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill>, a bill recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, and commending Muslims everywhere for their faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always admired the unwavering commitment Muslims show towards their faith during the holy month of Ramadan. It has been an honor to join many of my Muslim friends during this month of family togetherness, selfless service, worship and spiritual rebirth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the grandson of immigrants, I know true assimilation means preserving tradition while achieving success. I am in awe at how quickly the Muslim-American community has mastered both. In a matter of decades, the Muslim-American community has rapidly assimilated into American society. With shared values of hard work, discipline, community, family and culture, it's no wonder that Muslim-Americans are one of the fastest growing, most educated and highest earning ethnic groups in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America owes much of its vibrant society and rich culture to the contributions of Muslim-Americans. From the medical professionals who care for us, the educators who teach us and the titans of industry large and small, Muslim-Americans are one of the most indispensable parts of our nation's ever-growing melting pot. Muslim-Americans are authentic Americans, and proof that the American Dream continues to thrive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="635">H.

This is an important resolution in support of our Muslim friends, neighbors and citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district we have many distinguished Muslim residents who contribute extensively to our community. They work tirelessly to educate our community about their faith and work to build interfaith relationships across our communities. For this I am deeply grateful. Their efforts, along with those of other people of faith in my district, are enabling us to build a strong and pluralistic environment that promotes tolerance and diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this time of international conflict, it is critical that we demonstrate solidarity with and support for members of the Muslim community in the United States and throughout the world. In two weeks I will be bringing faith leaders from across my district, including Jews, Muslims, Christians and Buddhists, to Washington, DC, for a day of discussions with Members of Congress and advocacy organizations to help further the important interfaith work already underway throughout the Central Coast of  California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for all of the people of faith in my district who are working to promote peace and justice through understanding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of House Resolution 635, a resolution recognizing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. On September 13 this year, millions of Muslims throughout the world, and a great number in Michigan's 15th Congressional district, began a month of fasting, prayer, and spiritual renewal. It is an important step for acceptance and tolerance within the United States that Congress, for the first time, is recognizing this exceptional religious observance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims engage in self-discipline and purification. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims refrain from common daily activities such as eating and drinking, and tobacco use. Muslims also spend time reading the Koran, contemplating Islam, and cleansing their spirits. Ramadan is also a time to gather with family and friends, both at the nightly iftar, as well as at the conclusion of Ramadan, during the Id-al-Fitr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a pleasure to join my colleagues in honoring the celebration of Ramadan, not simply because Muslims are an important and growing part of American society, but also because goals and tenets of Ramadan--self sacrifice, charity, and spiritual renewal--are shared by Americans of all faiths. Hopefully, Congressional recognition of Ramadan will lead to an increased appreciation for these shared values. Certainly, recognizing Ramadan, along with its observance in the United States, contributes  to the vibrancy, dynamism, and character of our great Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ms. Speaker I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill>, recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith. I would like to thank my colleague, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, as well as the 30 other cosponsors for introducing this important and timely piece of legislation. I would also like to thank Chairman Lantos for his  leadership on this issue. This important legislation brings us together in celebration with our Muslim brothers and sisters, during this, their holy month of fasting and spirituality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the tragic terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, patriotic, law-abiding Muslims-Americans of the Islamic faith have been targeted by threats and incidents of violence. The House of Representatives has rebuked and condemned such actions from their very inception, with their September 14, 2001 resolution condemning bigotry and violence against American Muslims, and must continue to do so. It is important during this period of international uncertainty and apprehension  to look to our commonalities, recognizing universal values that transcend culture, nationality, and religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Muslim American Community has grown in size and prominence, and is an integral part of the fabric of this nation. The Muslim population in North America is characterized by its diversity. Some 80 nations are represented in the mosque communities of the United States, including a variety of traditions, practices, doctrines, and beliefs. Muslim Americans share the same values and ideals that make this nation great. These include ideals such as discipline, generosity, peace and moderation. In  no month is this more evident than in the month of Ramadan, when more than a billion Muslims all across the world renew their bonds to family and friends, to neighbors and colleagues, and most of all to God. Ramadan is a special time of prayer and fasting, contemplation of God's greatness, and service to those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is in the spirit of equality and sharing that we must recognize the universal values of family, community, and faith that we all share. By recognizing the Islamic faith as one of the great religions of the world, the House of Representatives may demonstrate solidarity with and support for the members of the Muslim community, both within the United States and throughout the world. By supporting this legislation, we may convey our respect to the Muslim community and commend the  vast majority of Muslims within the U.S. and across the globe who have rejected the misapplication and misinterpretation of their religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a co-sponsor of this legislation I feel that this is an issue we must address and I therefore strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>

This resolution also commends the Muslims in the United States and across the globe for their devotion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ramadan demonstrates the strength of each Muslim's faith with a month of prayers, fasting, charity and self reflection. It is a beautiful observance each year by those who believe in Islam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to have resolutions like this that recognizes and shows respect for one of the world's most significant religions, Islam, and the nearly 1.5 billion Muslims throughout the world. Following the September 11th attacks, I am sad to say, there was an outbreak of bigotry and violence against Arab-Americans, American Muslims and Americans from South Asia. Intolerance is not an American value and Congress must show its support for the community of Islam in the United States and throughout  the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, Congressman GREGORY MEEKS and Congressman KEITH ELLISON for introducing the resolution and working to bring it to the House floor today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="635">H. Res. 635</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our Founding Fathers recognized, the strength of this great Nation derives from the tolerance we espouse. America builds strength from its diversity. I am proud to be a part of a country where every person may practice their religious beliefs without fear. At a time when religious differences are igniting conflicts throughout the world, America serves as a beacon of hope that religious tolerance is not only achievable, but only serves to make a country stronger and more viable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Islamic faith follows the lunar calendar. During the ninth month of the lunar calendar, called "Ramadan," the Arabic term for intense heat and scorched earth, Muslims throughout the world celebrate the revelation of the Quran. In 2007, the month of Ramadan lasts from September 13 to October 12. This sacred month is observed with prayers, fasting, and charity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we could all use a time of peace and reflection. Ramadan embodies these principles, and I applaud our Muslim friends and neighbors for their sincere religious beliefs.</paragraph>
