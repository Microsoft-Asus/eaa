    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the war to end all wars, World War I, ended on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1911. In these words, Armistice Day became our Nation's day to give our gratitude to all, to all of our servicemen and women, as President Wilson proclaimed: "To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us  and because the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace and justice. Peace and justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Eisenhower would later, in 1954, change this title to Veterans Day. This 110th Congress has fulfilled its duty to the spirit and the meaning of Veterans Day by passing the largest increase in veterans benefits in the past 77 years, making certain all vets receive the benefits they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Veterans Day day, please, please thank a veteran for their service, for this is still our Nation's finest hour.</paragraph>
