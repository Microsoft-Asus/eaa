  <narrative>WELCOMING RABBI FREDERICK L. KLEIN -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10437]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend my good friend, Rabbi Fred Klein, for his uplifting prayer that he delivered for us this morning, as well as for his tireless efforts to strengthen the Jewish community in my home district of South Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rabbi Klein serves as the Director of Community Chaplaincy at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and is the Executive Vice President of the Rabbinical Association of Greater Miami. In these roles, Rabbi Klein offers counsel to the physically and mentally ill in their greatest times of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long been aware of Rabbi Klein's commitment and contributions  to academia, to the Jewish community, and the social welfare of all of South Florida. But his greatest achievement, Mr. Speaker, is his family, including his four children, Moshe who is 11, Shuli who is 9, Benny is 6 years old, and Aryeh almost 4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opening prayer that Rabbi Klein delivered today reflects his intellectual fiber, as well as his determination to improve our community and our country. I thank Rabbi Klein for his invocation, and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead.</paragraph>
