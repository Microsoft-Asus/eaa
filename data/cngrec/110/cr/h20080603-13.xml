    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today gas prices are hovering around $4 a gallon, and good legislation that would help ease the pain at the pump languishes due to congressional inaction. Washington is just not working for average taxpayers in North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I've seen some good ideas to deal with high gas prices, but we can't seem to get them brought to the floor for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, I'm a cosponsor of Mr. Young's American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act, which addresses both sides of this issue. It would tap domestic oil in an environmentally sensitive way and then use the tens of billions of dollars of Federal revenue to invest in 18 different existing alternative energy programs, from wind energy to water energy, all without raising taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How high will the Pelosi premium have to get before we vote on commonsense legislation like this? This bill proves that we can bring down the price of gas while investing in the energy of the future without raising taxes on America's working families.</paragraph>
