  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO VALORIA LOVELAND -- (Senate - May 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3973">S3973</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Valoria Loveland, who recently stepped down from her position as the director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Ms. Loveland has worked in Washington State and local governments for the past 44 years, and she has recently retired to some well-deserved relaxation in her home of Pasco, WA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Loveland's career in government began at the Franklin County Courthouse, where she worked before and while she was the county's treasurer. In 1992, she was elected to the State senate, where she swiftly rose to become the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and the most powerful woman in the Washington State Legislature. After 8 years in the senate, and a brief 2-year break from government, Valoria was appointed director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture, where she served  for the last 6 years. In her time as director, Washington's agricultural exports have risen to record highs, in large part, thanks to her leadership. Her multiple trips to China, Japan, and Mexico have extended numerous opportunities to Washington State growers, and I thank her for working towards opening those markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her career, Valoria Loveland has been known for her ability to get things done and solve problems. Never one to shy away from tough issues, her straightforward manner and tireless work ethic have earned her the respect of many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Loveland's leadership will be sorely missed in Washington State, which has benefitted greatly from her years of service. I wish her well, and thank her for her dedication to the State of Washington.</paragraph>
