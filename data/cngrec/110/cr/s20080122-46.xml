    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe the 100th anniversary of Muir Woods National Monument, located in Marin County, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was U.S. Representative William Kent whose visionary actions would lead to the creation of Muir Woods National Monument. During the mid-nineteenth century, the Gold Rush brought treasure seekers to northern California in large numbers. To accommodate this rapid population growth in San Francisco and other coastal cities, timber, meat, and crops were needed in much larger quantities. As a result, much of the easily accessible timber in Marin County was logged between 1840 and 1870.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Kent witnessed this massive resource depletion and decided to take action to preserve coastal redwood forest areas. In 1905, he purchased 612 acres of the Redwood Canyon from the Tamalpais Land &amp; Water Co. On December 26, 1907, in order to best protect the land, Representative Kent and his wife, Elizabeth Thatcher Kent, donated 298 acres of Redwood Canyon to the Federal Government. On January 9, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a National Monument. This year,  we celebrate its centennial anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coast redwoods, Sequoia sempervirens, are the dominant feature of Muir Woods' forest. These ancient wonders are also the world's tallest living tree species and the official tree of the State of California. This species of redwood is believed to have existed when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Visitors to Muir Woods are left fascinated as they get to experience living history by exploring the Bohemian and Cathedral groves of Muir Woods, where many trees are more than 1,200 years old. Muir Woods  is also home to douglas fir, tanbark oak, bigleaf maple, and bay laurel trees, leading conservationist and namesake John Muir to remark that Muir Woods "is the best tree-lovers' monument that could possibly be found in all the forests of the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only 15 miles north of San Francisco, Muir Woods National Monument offers a stunning glimpse of the redwood forests that once covered northern California's coastal valleys. For 100 years, Muir Woods National Monument has served as a recreational escape for nature enthusiasts, hikers, and those seeking a glimpse of northern California's rich history. It is a powerful reminder of the beauty of nature and the importance of conservation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the National Park Service staff and volunteers for maintaining the natural beauty and historical significance of Muir Woods National Monument. I look forward to future generations having the opportunity to study and enjoy this unique piece of our State and national history for another 100 years.</paragraph>
