  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor Dr. David Tawei Lee, who has been Taiwan's chief representative to the United States. Dr. Lee will be assuming his new post as Taiwan's top envoy in Canada this month, leaving his post in Washington to take on this new role in Ottawa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known David for decades, and he has been a staunch ally and strong advocate for West Virginia. He has helped me, and our State, to make inroads in the Taiwanese economy and has been instrumental in the continuing success of businesses with roots in both Taiwan and West Virginia. This ongoing economic relationship is enormously important for both sides and has allowed West Virginia to continue to grow its burgeoning aviation industry and to explore business opportunities we never thought  possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of the hard work of Representative Lee and others, Sino Swearingen Aircraft Company continues its push toward mass production of one of the most impressive business jets in the world. In addition, in my personal interactions with David, he has always been straightforward, honest, compassionate, and well-informed. I knew he would level with me during any difficult time and that I could count on him to fairly and accurately relay the results of our meetings to his people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Lee has worked hard during the last 2 1/2  years to renew and strengthen the political, economic, and social ties that bind the United States and Taiwan. On many difficult occasions, David Lee has risen to the challenge, and as Taiwan's Chief Representative to the United States he has given countless hours assisting lawmakers, administration officials, and the private sector in understanding the complex relationship between our people and ensuring that our longstanding  friendship continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Lee was educated at the National Taiwan University and received his Ph.D. in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia. David is a true democrat, firmly committed to the principles of democracy and capitalism. He has been an asset for both Taiwan and the United States, and he has served Taiwan with honor, integrity, and distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Lee's record of distinguished public service to his people spans more than two decades. He began his career at the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, Office in Washington, DC, in l982 as a staff consultant and soon rose to various important posts in Taiwan's foreign ministry. From l997 to l998, he was Director-General, Government Information Office, and Government spokesman for Taiwan. From l998 to 2001, he served as Deputy Foreign Minister; from 2001 to 2004, he was Taiwan's  Representative to the European Union, stationed in Belgium. Since the summer of 2004, he has served as the Republic of China's chief representative in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our loss here in Washington will be Canada's gain. In his new role as Taiwan's representative to Canada, David will continue to be a strong advocate for policies that will encourage expanded trade and a continuing good relationship between Taiwan and the rest of the world. Again, I would like to take this opportunity to wish Representative and Madame Lee the very best of luck. They are our good friends, and we will miss them.</paragraph>
