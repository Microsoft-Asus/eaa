  <narrative>SENATOR TED KENNEDY -- (Senate - October 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12832">S12832</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it is also important to tell everyone Senator Kennedy is strong and well and happy. He had some minor surgery that was important surgery. A lot of people do not know Senator Kennedy was nearly killed in an airplane crash. His life was saved by EVAN BAYH's father, Birch Bayh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He never complains, but Senator Kennedy has constant pain from his back. As a result of that, he had some work done to see what was going on with his back. They did a CAT scan of his full spine, which normally is not done because most of the trouble in his back is in the low back, not the high back. As a result of that, they fortuitously--with good fortune because of the high x-ray--checked and a carotid artery was plugged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was very fortuitous that was done. His wife Jackie thinks that is a miracle, and it certainly is a blessing in their lives because as a result of taking a look at his spine, they were able to spot that and avoid some serious problems in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot possibly overstate the importance of Senator Kennedy's leadership in this body as we address the critical issues that lie ahead in this work period. For 45 years he has been a person who has been on the cutting edge of doing the right thing for this country and certainly for the State of Massachusetts.</paragraph>
