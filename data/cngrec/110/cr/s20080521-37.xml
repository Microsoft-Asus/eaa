    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor veterans from my home State who are taking part in the first Nebraska Heartland Honor Flight to visit the National World War II Memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National World War II Memorial is a fitting tribute to those remarkable Americans who served in the deadliest conflict in human history. From the beaches of Normandy to the shores of Iwo Jima, these veterans served with courage, honor, and selflessness. In addition to their service, these same veterans returned home to reinvigorate the United States, producing what is still the largest and most vibrant economy in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon after President Clinton authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission to establish a World War II memorial, a comprehensive national fundraising campaign began under the leadership of former Senator Bob Dole, the national chairman and a World War II veteran from Kansas. During this time, as Governor of the State of Nebraska, I realized it was imperative to secure funding as soon as possible so that a memorial could be built in time for our veterans to view it. Therefore, on June 1,  1998, I presented a check to Senator Bob Dole in the amount of $52,900 for every Nebraskan who served in World War II. Subsequently, every State that donated money followed our guideline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are now close to 14,000 World War II veterans living in the State of Nebraska. Unfortunately, nearly 2,100 of these brave servicemembers pass away each year. Many of these veterans have not been able to visit the memorial, which was dedicated by President George W. Bush on May 29, 2004, as they confront increasing difficulties with traveling due to their age. However, the Honor Flight Program has proven to be a reliable and capable partner in helping alleviate any obstacles veterans may  face in traveling to Washington, DC. The Honor Flight Program, started in 2005 by retired Air Force captain and physician's assistant Earl Morse, now has 69 "hubs" in 30 States and has established a goal of transporting 12,000 World War II veterans to view the memorial in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am proud to say that the Heartland Honor Flight, Nebraska's own program, will conduct its inaugural flight, transporting more than 100 Nebraska World War II veterans to our Nation's Capital to visit the National World War II Memorial. I am greatly appreciative to the businesses and individuals who have contributed to this cause and am especially grateful to Dan and Cara Whitney, who provided nearly all the funding required for the cost of this initial flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will be an emotional and reflective occasion for these veterans who look upon their service with deserved pride and remember those who died making the ultimate sacrifice for our country in the name of freedom. This memorial was long overdue for those who served our Nation in World War II, and I am confident it will become an enduring symbol in remembering the determination and sacrifice of our country's "greatest generation."</paragraph>
