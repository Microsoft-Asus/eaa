  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last night the President did what he said he was going to do for weeks now. He vetoed the Democrat supplemental that was loaded with pork, tied the hands of our generals on the ground and provided the enemy with an ill-conceived exit strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the President said last night, Mr. Speaker, "Congress passed a bill that substitutes the judgment of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders." I couldn't agree with him more, and that's why I opposed this supplemental, and that's exactly why he vetoed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not, as a nation, be invested in defeat. Again, I repeat, we must not, as a nation, be invested in defeat. Unilateral surrender may be the Democrats' plan, but it will not lead to a safer America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that the veto has taken place, it is simply unacceptable for the Democrat leaders to delay any further the funding that our American troops deserve. Let's pass a clean Iraq supplemental.</paragraph>
