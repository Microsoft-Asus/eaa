    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill> directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the United States Geological Survey, to establish a nutrient and sediment monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin. We strongly support <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill>, championed by our colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Ron Kind. This bill would put into place a coordinated public-private approach to sediment and nutrient monitoring in the Upper Mississippi River Basin as part of an effort  to improve water quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Upper Mississippi River is extremely important not only to the communities and States along the route it flows, but also to the Nation as a whole. Twenty-one years ago, Congress designated this river segment as both a nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant navigation system. It is the only inland river in the United States to have such a designation. Our colleague, Ron Kind, has worked hard to secure enactment of this legislation. I commend him for his diligent  effort on this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill> and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic bill manager has more than adequately explained this piece of legislation. The House has passed a similar version of this bill in the previous two Congresses. I am certainly happy to see that we are doing so again.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill I have authored that will help scientists and local officials make informed, scientifically based decisions about one of the most important natural resources in this country, the Upper Mississippi River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mississippi River is one of America's great national treasures, running right through the heart of this country. It is North America's largest migratory bird flyway, with 40 percent of the continent's waterfowl species using this corridor during their annual migrations. It also waters the Nation's breadbasket, providing the nutrient-rich soils we enjoy in the midwest and water for irrigation. It also provides drinking water for nearly 30 million Americans and a passageway for billions of  dollars in commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, the Mississippi is threatened by increasing sediment and nutrient flows that gum up the river and poison its ecosystems. <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill>, The Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act, is a commonsense piece of legislation that would establish a coordinated public-private approach to reducing these threats, which affect all parts of the river and even the Gulf of Mexico where nutrients have created and continue to enlarge the gulf dead zone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can address these issues, but we need hard scientific data to do it. That is where this bill comes in. <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill> establishes a sub-basin monitoring program whereby the United States Geological Service will monitor where nutrients enter the river and use computer modeling to follow the nutrient flows downstream. This will allow local conservationists and land managers to pinpoint exactly where conservation and education are most needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This scientific approach has received widespread approval and been endorsed by the five Upper Mississippi State Governors. I thank the Natural Resources Committee staff for helping put this innovative piece of legislation together, and I thank the chairman for his support of the bill. This bill has passed the House in each of the last three Congresses, and I urge my colleagues to support it again today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I do understand that Representative Kind has been delayed, as well, by the storm; and he wanted to be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2381">H.R. 2381</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
