    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hanley Graham Denning was only 36 when a terrible traffic accident in Guatemala took her away from us on January 18. She was revered in Guatemala where she was known as "El Angel del Basuero," the Angel of the Dump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hanley was a native of Yarmouth, Maine, and a Bowdoin College graduate, with a master's degree in early childhood education from Wheelock College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After college, she helped children affected by AIDS in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and then taught impoverished children at a Head Start program in North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because so many children were from migrant families and spoke little or no English, Hanley decided to go to Guatemala to learn to speak their language. While in Guatemala City in 1999, the Portland Press Herald reported, a friend suggested she visit the garbage dump. There, Denning began the work that would come to define her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that trip to the dump, the largest in Central America, Hanley was shocked to see a tiny hand reaching out from a cardboard box. "At first she thought it was a doll, then she realized it was a baby," her friend Rachel Meyn told the Press Herald. "The image kept playing over and over in her head," Meyn added, "and from then on she decided she had to do something." What Hanley Denning did was to sell her car and her computer, convert an old chapel near the dump into a drop-in center for  the children, and give 40 Guatemalan boys and girls a refuge from the filth and stench of the dump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hanley soon learned that the health hazards at the dump were only a small part of the danger facing these children. Most came from single-parent households, where mothers scavenged the dump, often helped by the children, to find scrap to sell in order to buy food. Drug abuse, crime, child abuse, and predation were rampant. Hanley decided to create an environment where the children could escape harm and find the kind of encouragement that she as a former Head Start teacher knew would give them  a better chance to grow into healthy successful adults. She called it "Camino Seguro," Safe Passage. The mothers and the children of Guatemala call Hanley Denning "Angel del Basuero," Angel of the Dump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eight years later, Hanley's modest effort has grown into a program that helps more than 500 needy children at three sites. It has an annual budget of $1.6 million and 100 Guatemalan staff members, including teachers, social workers, cooks, and other support staff. There is a three-story educational reinforcement center, with 13 classrooms, a fully stocked library, a computer lab with 13 computers, a kitchen for preparing 550 lunches daily, a medical clinic serving all children and their family  members, and a garden. Teens can receive vocational training, mothers and grandmothers can attend adult literacy and parenting classes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to their daily hot lunches, each child who attends regularly receives a monthly food bag for their family. Nearly 600 children fated to scavenge the dump like their parents are now in school. "I used to look into the children's eyes and see the adults they would become," Hanley once told the reporter. "Now they have a little hope. I see a bit more spark."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the success of Safe Passage is only part of Hanley Denning's legacy. Her angelic touch reached beyond the Guatemalan slums and into the lives of hundreds of volunteers, many of them teenagers, who worked for Safe Passage over the years. There are 50 volunteers working at Safe Passage in any given month, including 20 long-term volunteers who make a 1-year or 2-year commitment to the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Jason Moyer-Lee told the Portland Press Herald's Bill Nemitz, "I couldn't believe that someone from my town who went to my high school could actually make something like that happen. When Hanley sat down and talked to you, she made you feel like, without your help, Safe Passage couldn't happen," he said. "It didn't matter how much you gave or how little, she made you feel like you were the number one contributor."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I've never loved more than when I was combing lice out of children's hair," added Aly Spaltro, a Brunswick High School senior who volunteered at Safe Passage in the past and plans to return before she returns to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although his sister Hanley died young, her brother Jordan said at her memorial that she had lived a much fuller life than most people, and she inspired everyone who loved her to "give every ounce of ourselves to what we truly believe in."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I refer to safepassage.org for on Hanley Denning's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Catherine Lopez Reyes, a five year old at Safe Passage, best summed up the feelings of all whose lives Hanley Denning changed for the better: "Hanley, te quiero mucho, We love you very much, Hanley.</paragraph>
