  <narrative>GERALDINE TABOR HALL -- (Senate - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6863">S6863</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Mrs. Geraldine Tabor Hall has passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerry, as her friends called her, was the wife of Judge K.K. Hall, or K.K. as his friends called him. She was a retired registered nurse, a great West Virginian, and a very dear friend. My beloved wife Erma and I spent many an evening with the Halls. We would often stay with Gerry and Judge Hall when we were in Charleston, and always found her to be a most gracious and generous hostess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Gerry and Erma became particularly close. They enjoyed each other's company immensely. Maybe it was because they had so much in common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Gerry and Erma were as elegant as they were "down home," and both were perfect partners to their husbands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both had a lot to put up with in their husbands, busy public servants whose careers required a great deal from their wives. They were both patient, deeply kind, and tremendously devoted to the State of West Virginia. Neither ever sought the limelight, but each accepted a certain amount of standing in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Gerry and Erma were supremely good listeners. Judge K.K. Hall could be quite a character. He had a grand sense of humor, and Gerry was always sure to laugh at his stories. And when I delivered a speech or performed with a good string band back home, Erma listened attentively and nodded along. Both women had heard it all time and again, but there they were, always with their warm smiles, hearty laughs, and steady applause, as if it were the first time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like Erma, Mrs. Hall was a most gracious host. During my long and bitter 1982 Senate election, I recall how often she would answer the door late at night to find myself and my able assistant during that campaign, Jim Huggins, standing on her porch, expecting to spend the night in the comfort and shelter of the Hall home. This often occurred without warning, and, not infrequently, very late at night. But Gerry  never complained, never portrayed the slightest  annoyance. She not only provided us with a place to stay for the night, she cooked a solid breakfast for us in the morning, and then would send us on our way to our next campaign stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss this lovely and gracious person. But I am sure that she and her devoted husband, K.K., are together now. And Erma is there. And K.K. is practicing a tale to tell when we are all reunited again. And Erma and Gerry will laugh and applaud as if they had never heard it before.</paragraph>
