  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, called PEPFAR, has instituted a carefully crafted comprehensive approach to fighting the spread of AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This approach is based on the ABC prevention model that has proven highly successful in Uganda. This model was developed there by Africans in Africa. A stands for abstinence until marriage; B for be faithful, or monogamy; and C for condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This approach is working to reduce AIDS prevalence. But the Foreign Ops appropriations bill that we vote on today seeks to gut this comprehensive approach. Specifically, the bill does away with funding protections for the abstinence and fidelity parts of the model. It would remove the mandate for the A and B portions in the model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are very important components, and these are the most effective in reducing AIDS occurrence. Just look at this chart illustrating the experience in Kenya, proof that abstinence and fidelity work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have an amendment to restore funding for these protections in a results-based comprehensive ABC approach. I urge support.</paragraph>
