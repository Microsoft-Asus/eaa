    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the founding of Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, NM, on June 10, 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established 6 months after the entry of the United States into the Second World War, Holloman served as a training center for B-17, B-24, and B-29 bomber crews for the duration of that conflict. Over the course of the war, 20 bomber groups trained at Holloman before serving in the European and Pacific theaters of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Holloman became the primary Air Force base for the testing and development of guided missiles and unmanned aircraft. Holloman was also the site of several notable events, including a 1954 rocket-propelled sled test that reached speeds of 632 miles per hour and earned Dr. John P. Stapp the title of "Fastest Man Alive." Additionally, Holloman was the location of CPT Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr's, 102,800 feet skydive in 1960 that broke four world records and it was there that ENOS,  the chimpanzee who made the first American animal orbital flight, received his training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, a new era at Holloman began with the arrival of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing. For the last 39 years, the 49th has called Holloman home and has flown F-4 Phantom IIs, F-15 Eagles and in 1992 became the only Air Force unit equipped with the F-117 Nighthawk, also known as the stealth fighter. Holloman also serves as the home to the German Air Force Tactical Training Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Holloman is preparing for another major transition. As the F-117 is retired, the 49th will begin to receive new F-22 Raptors. Since its founding, Holloman has played an important role in the development of new technologies and has been home to the world's most advanced aircraft. Most importantly though, I believe it is the men and women who serve at Holloman who make it one of this country's premier military installations. I would like to thank all those who served and continue to serve  at Holloman for their hard work and dedication. I have no doubt the work done at Holloman will continue to contribute to the national security of the United States for another 65 years.</paragraph>
