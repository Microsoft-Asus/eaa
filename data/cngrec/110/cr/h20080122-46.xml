  <narrative>SCHIP VETO OVERRIDE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H378]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a new report by the Joint Economic Committee shows that a million more children a year may need public health insurance due to worsening economic conditions, even apart from the growing trend in public coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If history is any guide, an economic downturn will lead to substantial increases in the demand for children's health and Medicaid, including some 70,000 additional children in each year of a downturn in my home State of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the administration is proposing a range of cutbacks to these programs that will make the problem even more severe. And State budgets are already strained by the weak national economy and the growing housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a perfect economic storm that can be avoided if Congress votes today or tomorrow to override the President's veto of legislation that would bring health care to 10 million children in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the next 5 years, our bill would preserve coverage for the more than 6 million children currently covered by children's health care and extend coverage to nearly 4 million children who are currently uninsured. Overriding the President's veto of SCHIP reauthorization would guarantee sufficient funding levels for the Children's Health Program to serve future enrollment needs. Additional Medicaid assistance to the States would also provide shelter from the coming economic storm. Increasing  the Federal Medicaid match percentage to the States as part of a stimulus package would help ease the blow of the economic slowdown on our children, families, and States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto of children's health care tomorrow.</paragraph>
