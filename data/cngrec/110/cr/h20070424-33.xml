  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week the House will once again take up an Iraq emergency funding bill which is seriously flawed and should be rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having 535 politicians attempt to micromanage the war on terror from atop Capitol Hill is a recipe for disaster. This Congress should not be telegraphing our war strategy to the enemy and setting arbitrary timetables for withdrawal, nor should we be tying the hands of our Commander in Chief and military leaders on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq has become a central battlefield on the war on terror, not because we say so, but because the terrorists themselves have declared Iraq to be the central front for their global jihad. Therefore, it is vital that we win the war and achieve success in Iraq. To do so, this Congress must reject efforts to micromanage the war and give the Iraqi new strategy opportunity to succeed.</paragraph>
