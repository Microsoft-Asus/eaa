  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="Introducing S. 2280. A bill to amend the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve Boundary Modification Act to expand the boundaries of the existing sanctuary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Created as a unique Federal-State partnership in October 2000, the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary has been a resounding success. It has preserved the proud maritime history of the Great Lakes, offered educational opportunities to children and researchers, and provided a fascinating site for divers and snorklers to explore. Expanding the sanctuary will bring even greater benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration originally considered the Sanctuary, it recommended an area that was twice as big as what was eventually established. That proposal was scaled back to address concerns raised by some state and local communities who wanted to begin cautiously. Some of the doubters and most cautious at the beginning have now become the biggest supporters of the sanctuary. Today, the expansion has broad support throughout the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill would extend the sanctuary's boundaries to include the waters off Alcona, Alpena and Presque Isle Counties in Michigan and  would extend the sanctuary east to the International boundary. This would be a significant increase in total area. The current sanctuary includes 448 square miles of water and 115 miles of shoreline, and the expansion would include 3,722 square miles and include 226 miles of shoreline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This expansion is needed to protect the maritime history of Michigan and the Great Lakes. Historically, this region was influenced by the demand for natural resources. Because local roads were so inadequate, the Great Lakes became an important passageway and trading route for settlement and industrialization. The geography of Thunder Bay and the weather patterns in the lakes, however, caused dozens of ships to perish in what mariners call "Shipwreck Alley." Many of these shipwrecks are well-preserved  because they are in freshwater and of great interest to researchers and students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current sanctuary holds 116 shipwrecks though many, many more shipwrecks in this area have been mentioned in historical records. In addition to shipwrecks, the sanctuary protects and interprets the remains of commercial fishing sites, historic docks, and other underwater archaeological sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding the boundaries as provided for in this bill will protect an estimated 178 additional shipwrecks. For example, it would protect the Cornelia B. Windiate, which is a three-mast wooden schooner and one of the Great Lakes' most intact shipwrecks. The ship sank in December 1875 when bound from Milwaukee to Buffalo with a cargo of wheat, and was featured in an episode of Deep Sea Detectives on the History Channel. Expansion would also cover the H.P. Bridge, a three-mast  wooden barkentine, containing many artifacts such as pottery, clothing, and ship tackle and hardware.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These shipwrecks are not only historically important, they are very popular with divers. Deep water wrecks are popular for technical divers, and because the sites are often well preserved in the cold freshwater, they contain many artifacts and provide a treasure of information about the past. Many of the shallow water wrecks are accessible by snorkelers, boaters and kayakers. These sites offer a tremendous amount of archaeological data on ship architecture and are generally easier to document.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sanctuary is also making important contributions to research and education. Using real-time video links, students in Alpena interact with divers exploring underwater worlds with people who are thousands of miles away. In the near future, students from around the country will be able to control remote submarines that allow them to explore the E.B. Allen or the steamship Montana. Visitors to Thunder Bay can also view artifacts and interpretive exhibits and watch films about  Thunder Bay and all of our Nation's Maritime Sanctuaries. Scientists from around the world dock their vessels in the Thunder Bay River as they use the facility for their research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sanctuary has also been a real asset for the local community, and the community has responded in kind. Since the establishment of the sanctuary, the community has worked with it to improve the Alpena County George N. Fletcher Library, to provide volunteers at festivals and outreach events, and to help digitize the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary deserves to be expanded. Doing so will preserve important maritime history and will continue the success of the current Sanctuary. It is a unique treasure that needs our support. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2282. A bill to increase the number of full-time personnel of the Consumer Product Safety Commission assigned to duty stations at United States ports of entry or to inspect overseas production facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2282">S. 2282</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to increase the number of full-time personnel of the Consumer Product U.S. Safety Commission assigned to duty stations at U.S. ports of entry or to inspect overseas production facilities to ensure that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has the personnel necessary to adequately address the growing problem of import safety. This bill would more than triple the current number of commission staff assigned to U.S. ports of entry, by requiring  that no less than 50 full-time import inspectors be in place at the beginning of the next fiscal year. Additionally, it would expressly authorize the CPSC to send such inspectors to examine the operations at overseas factories which manufacture consumer products destined for the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is critically necessary, given that an ever-increasing number of the consumer products now sold on our shelves are manufactured in countries with appalling safety and quality control standards, such as China. Sine the year 2000, foreign imports to the U.S. have increased 67 percent by value, with imports from China nearly tripling, growing from $100 billion in 2000 to $288 billion last year. Almost 20 percent of consumer products sold in the U.S. today were made in China. Particularly  troubling is that Chinese manufacturers have cornered the U.S. market on toys, with over 80 percent of all toys sold in the U.S. coming from China. Since March 2007, over 8 million pieces of these Chinese-made toys have been recalled due to lead contamination alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outrageously, the number of CPSC personnel dedicated to monitoring import compliance with U.S. health and safety requirements has been slashed along with other Commission resources during the very period in which trade liberalization has allowed foreign producers greater access to our markets. With over 60 percent of CPSC staff having been cut over the past 27 years--from almost 1,000 employees in 1980 to a record low of 420 employees in 2007--there remain only 15 full-time Commission personnel  assigned to inspect imports at U.S. ports. According to a September 2, 2007, New York Times article, this handful of import inspectors "are hard pressed to find dangerous cargo before it enters the country; instead, they rely on other Federal agents, who mostly act as trademark enforcers." Similarly unacceptable is the fact that the CPSC lacks the staff to send a single inspector to the foreign factories making the goods that we put on our kitchen counters and in the hands of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These facts unquestionably reveal, as a Consumers Union official told the Senate Committee on Finance earlier this month, that the CPSC has not kept up with the globalization of the marketplace. That is why I have proposed this bill, which would rapidly shore-up the commission's import inspection staff, who are so critical to protecting us from dangerous foreign products. I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense solution to an urgent problem.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="Introducing S. 2287. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock mines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2287">S. 2287</bill>] Mr. President, today I am very pleased to be joined by Senators CANTWELL and FEINSTEIN in introducing legislation to eliminate from the Federal tax code the "Percentage Depletion Allowance" for hardrock minerals mined on Federal public lands. Elimination of this double subsidy will produce estimated savings of at least $500 million over 5 years, based on the most recent year for which figures are available from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Clinton administration's  fiscal year 2001 budget proposal. These savings will help fund the reclamation and restoration of abandoned mines through an Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, that my bill creates, and the remaining  3/4  of savings will be returned to the Federal treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percentage depletion allowances were initiated by the Corporation Excise Act of 1909. That is right, these allowances were initiated nearly 100 years ago. Provisions for a depletion allowance based on the value of the mine were made under a 1912 Treasury Department regulation, but difficulty in applying this accounting principle to mineral production led to the initial codification of the mineral depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of 1913. The  Revenue  Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in its present form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance was then extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by the Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax code to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction industries far below tax rates on other industries, providing incentives to increase investment, exploration, and output. The problem, however, is that percentage depletion also makes it possible to recover many times the amount of the original investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to recover the costs of its capital investment: cost depletion and percentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the actual capital investment--the costs of discovering, purchasing, and developing a mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve produces income. Under the cost depletion method, the total deductions cannot exceed the original capital investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under percentage depletion, however, the deduction for recovery of a company's investment is a fixed percentage of "gross income," namely, sales revenue from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total deductions typically exceed the capital that the company invested. The set rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 of the Internal Revenue Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals and minerals, at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no restriction in the tax code to ensure that over time companies do not deduct more than the capital that a company has invested. Furthermore, a Percentage Deduction Allowance makes sense only so long as the deducting company actually pays for the investment for which it claims the deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result is a double subsidy for hardrock mining companies: first they can mine on public lands for free under the General Mining Law of 1872, and then they are allowed to take a deduction for capital investment that they have not made for the privilege to mine on public lands. My legislation would eliminate the use of the Percentage Depletion Allowance for mining on public lands, resulting in an estimated savings of $450 million over 5 years, while continuing to allow companies to recover  reasonable cost depletion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill would also create a new fund, called the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. One-fourth of the revenue raised by the bill, or approximately $110 million, would be deposited into an interest-bearing fund in the Treasury to be used to clean up abandoned hardrock mines in states that are subject to the 1872 Mining Law. Though there is no comprehensive inventory of abandoned mines, estimates put the figure at upwards of 100,000 abandoned mines on public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently no comprehensive federal or state programs to address the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites requires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up abandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a first step toward providing the needed authority and resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's budget climate, we are faced with the question of who should bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of natural resources: the taxpayers, or the users and producers of the resource? For more than a century, the mining industry has been paying next to nothing for the privilege of extracting minerals from public lands and then abandoning its mines. Now those mines are adding to the nation's environmental and financial burdens. We face serious budget choices this fiscal  year, and one of those choices is whether to continue the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure I am introducing is straightforward. It eliminates the Percentage Depletion Allowance for hardrock minerals mined on public lands while continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable cost depletion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a government-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is now sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance that is consistent with depreciation rates given to other businesses. This corporate subsidy is simply not justified.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2288. A bill to establish portfolio quality standards, improve lender oversight by the Small Business Administration, create economic outcome and performance measurements, strengthen the loan programs under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act and title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2288">S. 2288</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with Senator KERRY to introduce the Small Business Lending Oversight and Program Performance Improvements Act of 2007. I truly appreciate Senator Kerry's leadership on small business issues and his bipartisan work with me on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small businesses have propelled our Nation's economic growth, producing more than 50 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, GDP, and creating between 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs annually. The Small Business Administration's loan guarantee programs are a vital source of financing for many of these small start-up firms, entrepreneurs seeking working capital, and small businesses that must purchase larger office space or secure factory equipment so they can continue to expand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, the SBA's 7(a) and 504 lending programs will not endure if careless oversight, and a lack of standards, allow scandal to tarnish the good names of these programs. The 7(a) and 504 lending programs will not survive if we cannot prove to taxpayers that the money spent to guarantee small business loans actually produces economic vitality, opportunity, and new jobs, for our Nation. Make no mistake, the only way to protect these integral programs and demonstrate their effectiveness  and economic growth capacity is through the use of concrete measurements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for the SBA's lending portfolios to grow and allow more small firms to secure the capital they require, the SBA must quantify both quality and performance by establishing the specific criteria it will examine and then assess changes in these factors over time. Additionally, these benchmarks must be codified and transparent so that lenders and small businesses understand what is being measured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is this: although the SBA evaluates portfolio quality, and uses these assessments to conduct lender oversight, the SBA has failed to provide participating lenders with some of the criteria or formulas the Agency uses to determine if their portfolios are sound or substandard. This lack of transparency not only hinders the SBA's lender oversight capabilities, it causes participating 7(a) and 504 lenders to be critical of the SBA's ability to accurately assess portfolio quality. Regrettably,  the SBA's current oversight and portfolio quality assessment methods have not prevented recent high-profile scandals from occurring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the SBA has roughly $60 billion in outstanding loans issued to small businesses. Yet incredulously it does not track these businesses' economic performance. While the SBA's total loan volume has increased substantially over the last 10 years, the agency has no way to show how these loans benefitted the U.S. economy. Ultimately, the SBA is unaware of how many jobs these loans have created, whether company net-sales or revenues have increased after securing capital, or how many of these  companies prepay, default, or go out of business. Though the purpose of these loans is to spur economic growth, the SBA does not assess the actual economic outcomes these loans help make possible. Without these measurements, how can the SBA attest to the incredible economic lift and vitality these loans help generate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two recent Government Accountability Office reports, one from July of this year and one from June of 2004, recommended that the SBA improve its economic performance and portfolio quality measurements. Our bill would implement the GAO's recommendations and improve the performance measures for 7(a) and 504 loans. Among other things, the bill would require the SBA to: create standards for lenders' portfolio quality; increase the transparency of the SBA's lender oversight evaluation measures; report  on borrowers' economic performance; and create a 7(a) and 504 portfolio default rate that can be compared directly to commercial lenders' default rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an obligation not only to maintain, but to strengthen and improve the SBA's key loan programs that I have heard time and again are a critical lifeline to the job generators we call small businesses. The remedies that Senator Kerry and I are proposing today are necessary for the SBA's lending programs to expand, and reach all of the small businesses that must have access to capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to strongly support the Small Business Lending Oversight and Program Performance Improvements Act.</paragraph>

FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Recent reports by the Government Accountability Office have recommended that the Small Business Administration develop better measurements and methods for measuring the performance of lending programs and the effectiveness of lender oversight.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) A July 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office entitled "Small Business Administration: Additional Measures Needed to Assess 7(a) Loan Program's Performance" found the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) Determining the success of the loan programs under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)) "is difficult as the performance measures show only outputs - the number of loans provided - and not outcomes, or the fate of the businesses borrowing with the guarantee.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) "The current measures do not indicate how well the agency is meeting its strategic goal of helping small businesses.".</narrative>
  <narrative> (C) "To better ensure that the 7(a) program is meeting its mission responsibility of helping small firms succeed through guaranteed loans, we recommend that the SBA administrator complete and expand the SBA's current work on evaluating the program's performance measures. As part of that effort, at a minimum, the SBA should further utilize the loan performance information it already collects, including but not limited to defaults, prepayments, and number of loans in good standing, to better  report how small businesses fare after they participate in the 7(a) program.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) A June 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office entitled "Small Business Administration: New Services for Lender Oversight Reflect Some Best Practices but Strategy for Use Lags Behind" found that "Best practices dictate the need for a clear and transparent understanding of how a risk management service and the tools it provides will be used.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 16731 Santa Ana Avenue in Fontana, California, as the &quot;Beatrice E. Watson Post Office Building&quot;; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2290">S. 2290</bill>] Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleague, Senator FEINSTEIN in introducing legislation to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 16731 Santa Ana Avenue in Fontana, California, as the "Beatrice E. Watson Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beatrice "Bea" Watson was a former city clerk and councilwoman of Fontana who volunteered tirelessly for her community. In an Inland Valley Daily Bulletin profile last year, fellow Fontana residents described Bea as a generous person who was devoted to her city, her friends, and the many organizations with which she worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the 40 years of her residence in Fontana, Bea was involved with numerous civic and community service organizations, including the Fontana Woman's Club, the Fontana Historical Society, Chamber of Commerce, the Fontana Exchange Club, Parks and Recreation and the Fontana Parent Teacher Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bea also was responsible for the continued existence of the Fontana Days Parade, the annual summer celebration of the city's 1913 founding by A.B. Miller, even dipping into her own pocket at times to keep the parade going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This August, Bea Watson, "Mrs. Fontana," passed away, and I know her loss has been deeply felt by her family and the community. The Fontana City Council asked Congress to honor Bea for bringing the whole community together for the betterment of Fontana. I am proud to introduce this bill, and encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing Bea Watson's example of dedicated service.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="Introducing S. 2291. A bill to enhance citizen access to Government information and services by establishing plain language as the standard style of Government documents issued to the public, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2291">S. 2291</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Plain Language in Government Communications Act of 2007. I am pleased that Senators Claire McCaskill, Tom Carper, and Carl Levin have joined me as original co-sponsors of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill is very similar to <bill type="h" number="3548">H.R. 3548</bill>, introduced by Representative Bruce Braley in September, along with original co-sponsors Representatives Todd Akin, DAN BURTON, JAMES MCGOVERN, and NANCY BOYDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would establish plain language as the standard writing style for Government documents issued to the public. Plain language is language that the intended audience can readily understand and use because it is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices of plain language writing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would extend an initiative that President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore started nearly a decade ago as part of the Reinventing Government initiative. In 1998 President Clinton directed agencies to write in plain language. Although many agencies have made progress in writing  more clearly, the requirement never was fully implemented, and in recent years, the focus on writing in plain language has flagged. This legislation will renew  that focus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits of requiring the Government to write in plain language are numerous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, using plain language improves customer service. Veterans, taxpayers, senior citizens, and others who need to understand Government instructions and fill out Government forms should not have to wade through complicated, bureaucratic language. Needlessly complicated Government documents waste countless hours of taxpayers' time and cause unnecessary errors. The Federal Government works best for the American people if Government documents are clear and straightforward. Filling out Government  forms should not be like solving a complex crossword puzzle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Writing in plain language also will make the Government more efficient and cost effective. Agencies that write in plain language spend less time answering customer service questions, and they obtain better compliance because people make fewer mistakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, using plain language makes Government more transparent. The American people cannot hold their Government accountable if no one can understand the information that the Government provides about its actions and its requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous organizations have called on Congress to require the Federal Government to use plain language. For example, the AARP wrote a letter in support of this legislation stating that every day AARP members contact AARP staff because they do not understand letters that they received from the Federal Government. The confusion is not the readers' fault. It is because many Federal Government letters are written in dense, complicated language that few  people who are not lawyers could be expected to understand. Certainly, anyone who has ever filled out their own tax forms can sympathize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, several small business organizations--including the National Small Business Association, the Small Business Legislative Council, and Women Impacting Public Policy--support the need for plain language. The reason is simple. Small businesses waste considerable time, effort, and money trying to decipher what the Federal Government requires of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses two important elements for ensuring that use of plain language becomes standard in Federal agencies: training and oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each agency will report their plans to train employees to write in plain language. Writing in plain, clear, concise, and easily understandable language is a skill that Congress and Federal agencies must foster. As Thomas Jefferson once said, "The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do." As a former teacher and principal, I understand that even very smart people must be trained to write plainly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, strong congressional oversight will ensure that agencies implement the plain language requirements. Agencies will be required to designate a senior official responsible for implementing plain language requirements. Each agency will be required to report to Congress how it will ensure compliance with the plain language requirement and on its progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few examples of the documents that will be covered by the plain language requirement are Federal tax forms; veterans' benefit forms; information for workers about Federal health, safety, overtime pay, and medical leave laws; Social Security and Medicare benefit forms; and Federal college aid applications. These documents help the American people obtain important Government benefits and improve their quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To avoid imposing an unmanageable burden on agencies, agencies will not be required to re-write existing documents in plain language. Only new or substantially revised documents will be covered. Similarly, this bill does not cover regulations, so that agencies can focus first on improving their every day communications with the American people. We recognize that it will be more challenging to write regulations--which by their nature often will be complex and technical--in plain language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring agencies to write in plain language is an important step in improving the way the Federal Government communicates with the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="Introducing S. 2292. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, to establish the Office for Bombing Prevention, to address terrorist explosive threats, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2292">S. 2292</bill>] Mr. President. I rise to introduce the National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007, an important measure to strengthen our domestic defenses against terrorist attacks using explosives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terror bombings have a long and bloody history around the world and here in the United States. In 1920, for example, an anarchist bombing in front of the New York Stock Exchange killed 38 people and wounded hundreds more. More recently, the 1990s bombings of the World Trade Center and the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and attacks in Indonesia, Spain, and Great Britain remind us of the vicious and indiscriminate threat posed by bombs. As Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff  has noted, they are the weapon of choice for terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security tell us that threat from these devices is not only real, but growing. Furthermore, the National Intelligence Estimate has identified improvised explosive devices or IEDs as a significant homeland-security threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As recent years' bombings demonstrate, the costs of inadequate precautions can be horrendous. And as the threat of bomb attacks by home-grown terrorist rises--witness the plot to bomb the JFK airport in New York--we must be increasingly on guard. Much effort and much funding has been directed to train and equip law-enforcement and other personnel to detect and disrupt bomb plots, yet we still lack a formal, full-fledged national strategy to coordinate and improve the effectiveness of those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I introduce today will improve our defenses against these weapons. I am proud to be working again with the bill's chief co-sponsor, Senator JOE LIEBERMAN, on this new effort to protect our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has also won the support of people directly involved in the fight against the threat of terrorist bombings. They include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; the National Bomb Squad Commanders Advisory Board; the National Tactical Officers Association; the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators; the Maine Emergency Management Agency; and the police departments of Bangor and Portland, Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007 has three main elements: First, the bill will clarify the responsibilities of the DHS Office of Bombing Prevention and authorize $25 million funding in both FY 2009 and 2010, up from the current Senate-passed funding level of $10 million in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill now pending at conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national fight against terrorist bombings is a large and multi-faceted undertaking. It includes screening airline passengers, checking cargo, securing dangerous chemicals, protecting critical infrastructure, promoting research and development of anti-IED technology, and sharing information among Government and private-sector partners. The DHS Office of Bombing Prevention is a leader in this fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Collins-Lieberman bill builds on the Office's past efforts. Among other things, the bill designates the Office of Bombing Protection as the lead agency in DHS for combating terrorist explosive attacks; tasks OBP with coordinating national and intergovernmental bombing-prevention activities; and assigns it responsibility for assisting state and local governments and cooperating with the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A key element of Federal assistance is training. Last week, for example, members of several Maine and Connecticut police departments received DHS training and briefings here in Washington, as well as an FBI update, and fresh information on improvised explosive devices. My bill will bring more of that training to the States and make it more accessible to local law-enforcement officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill directs the President to accelerate the release of the National Strategy for Bombing Prevention and to update it every four years. As terrorists' tactics change, we must review and adjust our counter-measures to defeat them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill will promote more research and development of counter-explosive technologies and facilitate the transfer of military technologies for domestic anti-terror use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation is badly needed. We need to make sure that bomb squads have the latest and most accurate information on bombing threats. We need to raise awareness of the signs of possible threats, including purchases of pre-cursor materials and other suspicious activities. We need to improve information sharing and coordination of activities among all levels of government as well as the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under my legislation, the Department of Homeland Security will have the legal authority, the responsibility, and the resources to ensure that state and local law-enforcement personnel receive the training and information they need to protect us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007 will give our country important new protections. The need for that protection has been amply demonstrated by repeated acts of savagery, and the threat of terrorist bombs continues to grow. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="Introducing S. 2292. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, to establish the Office for Bombing Prevention, to address terrorist explosive threats, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to join my Ranking Member on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Collins, in introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen our Nation's ability to deter, detect, prevent, and respond to attacks using improvised explosive devices, IED, in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen in Iraq, London, and Germany, IEDs are a weapon of choice for terrorists. The reality is that an IED is relatively easy and inexpensive to make and can cause mass casualties, even to armored military personnel. IEDs are a global threat, and the American public, here at home, is not immune.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal efforts to address this threat, however, have not been adequate. The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Bombing Prevention, which is the Department's lead agent for IED countermeasure coordination, is currently operating with a substantially reduced budget of $5 million, down from the $14 million it received in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Only $6 million has been requested for 2008. By contrast, the DHS Office of Health Affairs, which has a similar coordination responsibility  for biosecurity and medical preparedness, has a proposed budget for personnel and coordination activities of $28 million for 2008. Given the likelihood of an IED attack, we need to make a comparable commitment in this area. As Secretary Chertoff said in an October 19 speech,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007, NBPA, would formally authorize the Office of Bombing Prevention, OBP, and increase its budget to $25 million. In addition to leading bombing prevention activities within DHS, OBP would be directed to coordinate with other Federal, State, and local agencies and fill the existing gaps that are not covered by another Federal agency's current bombing prevention efforts. For example, OBP would work with state and local officials to conduct a national analysis  of bomb squad capabilities. This type of comprehensive assessment does not currently exist at any level of government, yet it is integral to understanding what resources are available in the event of an explosion and where we should invest in order to better prepare the Nation as a whole. OBP would also improve information sharing with state and local bomb squads by providing regular updates on terrorist tactics, techniques, and procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NBPA would require the President to deliver a long awaited National Strategy for Improvised Explosive Devices. This Strategy was supposed to be delivered to Congress by DHS in January 2007 but was then reassigned to the Department of Justice by presidential directive. Turf battles have caused further delay. This is simply unacceptable. Regardless of who takes the lead, the Nation must have a coherent strategy guiding its counter IED efforts that will clarify the roles and responsibilities  of all Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our legislation would require DHS to establish a program expediting  the transfer of counter IED technology to first responders. Under this program, the Department would work with other Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the private sector, and state and local bomb experts to identify existing technologies that could help deter, detect, prevent, or respond to an explosive attack. Often, there is a significant lag time between  the research and development of such technologies and deployment by the end user. This bill would hold DHS accountable for seeing products through to the deployment phase. Specifically, DHS would be required to develop an electronic countermeasures capability to disable radio controlled bombs. Radio "jammers" have been developed by DoD for Iraq and Afghanistan, but that technology needs to be significantly modified for the civilian environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improvised explosive devices are one of the most popular weapons terrorists are using today. They can be easily assembled from instructions available on the Internet with readily available chemicals such as peroxide or ammonium nitrate. And, most importantly, terrorists all over the world have demonstrated their intent and ability to use these weapons to kill and maim large numbers of people. If DHS is to plan effectively for future attacks here at home, it must have a cohesive and robust defense  against the most likely threats. I ask my colleagues to join us in ensuring DHS and its partners have the necessary tools to protect the U.S. from an improvised explosive device.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="Introducing S. 2295. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require a voter-verified permanent paper ballot under title III of such Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2295">S. 2295</bill>] Mr. President, today, joined by Senator WHITEHOUSE, I am introducing the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2007. As we enter the month of November, next year's national election is just one year away, and we must act now to ensure that the next time Americans go to the polls nationwide, they have the chance to cast their vote and have their vote counted as intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will require all voting machines--beginning in the 2008 election--to produce a paper record of each ballot that can be verified by the voter before a ballot is submitted to be counted. This also is the first bill to propose a nationwide ban, by 2012, on the use of touch-screen voting machines in Federal elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are introducing this bill to address the problems that have plagued the accuracy and integrity of our voting systems. We know all too well the problems that have occurred in Florida--in the 2000 election and, most recently in the 2006 congressional election in the 13th Congressional District--but my State is not alone. Recent studies in California and elsewhere have demonstrated that touch-screen voting machines are unreliable and vulnerable to error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is we have to ensure that every vote is counted--and counted properly. Citizens must have confidence in the integrity of their elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida, under the leadership of Governor Charlie Crist and Secretary of State Kurt Browning, has acted decisively, and on a bipartisan basis, to require the replacement of paperless touch-screen voting machines throughout the State with optical scan equipment. By using op-scan machines, voters will have the opportunity to complete a paper ballot that will be verified by the voter before it is electronically counted. By 2012, touchscreen voting machines will be a thing of the past in Florida.  Using Florida's model, the bill I am filing today will phase out touch-screen voting machines in Federal elections nationwide by 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning I met with Secretary Browning to discuss my intent to file legislation modeled on Florida's initiative. Secretary Browning indicated his support for a ban on touch-screen voting machines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to banning touch-screen machines by 2012, and requiring a voter-verified paper ballot for every vote that is cast, beginning in November 2008, other highlights of the bill are as follows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will require and fund routine random audits to be conducted by hand count in 3 percent of precincts in all Federal elections. If the vote is very close, that percentage goes up to 5 or 10 percent. On the other hand, if the winning candidate received more than 80 percent of the vote, no audit of that race will be necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will authorize adequate funding--$1 billion--for replacing and upgrading voting equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation will require that every voter has the opportunity to vote by paper ballot if the voting machine in their precinct is broken, and beginning in 2012, for any reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill will establish an arms-length relationship between test labs and voting machine vendors, to prevent any efforts, malicious or otherwise, to compromise the accuracy and integrity of voting machines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A companion version of our bill was introduced in the House by Representative RUSH HOLT of New Jersey, and was passed out of Committee. The bill now awaits a vote by the full Chamber. I hope my colleagues in the House will act to pass this important legislation, and I invite my colleagues in the Senate to join me by co-sponsoring our bill in the Senate. Florida not only provides a model for what can be done to increase our confidence in the integrity of elections, it provides a model for</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2297. A bill to require the FCC to conduct an economic study on the impact that low-power FM stations will have on full-power commercial FM stations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2297">S. 2297</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would require the Federal Communications Commission to fulfill its obligation of conducting an economic study on the impact low-power FM stations have on full-power commercial stations. The reason it is imperative the FCC perform this study is because we don't have a comprehensive understanding as to the effect that low-power FM stations have on their full-power counterparts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress imposed the three-adjacent-channel restriction on low-power licensees in 2001, we tasked the FCC with conducting two studies because we were concerned about the interference LPFM stations could cause with being too close in frequency to full-power commercial stations. The two studies were to determine the impact that the presence of a low-power channel would have with respect to interference with a nearby full-power station and the economic impact the presence of low power stations  would bring to the commercial licensees. However, the FCC completed only one study--the interference analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation calls for the FCC to complete an economic study on the impact LPFM stations have on full-power commercial radio stations within 18 months and report its findings to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteer, non-profit LPFM stations have found a niche but they also provide competition to full-power stations without having to incur the same costs as those commercial stations, particularly with the absence of licensing fees and employees' salaries. Most of us have raised serious concerns about the continued media consolidation that is occurring and negatively affecting localism and diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the reason for this consolidation is because local, independently owned stations are seeing lower profit margins, which are making it more and more difficult to continue broadcasting. Due to shrinking profit, these stations either go out of business or are sold out to larger, nationwide companies. The buy-out of local stations by out-of-town firms does more to harm diverse and locally oriented broadcasting than anything else. So we must actively investigate this trend and determine what  is contributing to the diminishing returns of independently owned stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may question why perform this study since Mitre Corporation, the company that performed the initial interference study, recommended the FCC should not undertake the additional expense of a formal listener test program or a Phase II economic analysis. The reason is because the Phase II economic analysis was only on the potential radio interference impact of LPFM on incumbent full-power stations and did not take into account other economic impacts that were outside the scope of that effort.  The Government must ensure that by opening up low-power FM broadcast opportunities we are not causing any undue harm to the full-power radio stations, which we have obligations to as the issuer of their licenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the critical legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2298">S. 2298</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would preserve the Federal Communications Commission's right to deny a low-power FM license if the applicant has run afoul of basic, longstanding Federal restrictions on the transmission of radio waves, such as if the applicant has been previously fined for running an unlicensed "pirate" radio station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the issuance of low-power licenses, numerous individuals and entities operated low-power FM stations without a broadcast license. These "pirate" stations many times broadcasted in open defiance of the Commission's initial ban on LPFM broadcasts. From January 1998 to February 2000, the Commission shut down, on average, more than a dozen unlicensed radio stations each month. On several separate occasions, these unlicensed radio stations actually disrupted air traffic control communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, through the enactment of the Radio Broadcast Preservation Act of 2000, directed the FCC to modify its low-power FM rules to "prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low-power FM license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the unlicensed operation of any station in violation of section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934" so the Commission could curtail these pirate stations and disruption occurrence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is by completely repealing section 632, which pending legislation proposes, it hinders the ability of the FCC to prohibit applicants from receiving low-power FM licenses. The Commission is responsible for making sure broadcasters follow the basic rules and regulations that are inherently essential to having a broadcast service that serves public interest since broadcasters are utilizing public spectrum. This legislation retains a targeted response to the problem of pirate broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission is to grant a broadcast license only if the "public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served." Completely repealing Section 632 could hinder the FCC from upholding this responsibility with respect to low-power FM broadcasters. For this  reason, we must act to preserve the FCC's authority to be able to prohibit low-power FM licenses to applicants that have violated basic tenets of broadcast policy--it is only logical that  we do this to ensure businesses that use the public spectrum, in any capacity, adhered to laws government has put in place to serve and protect the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the critical legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2299">S. 2299</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that I believe is vital to the prosperity and competitiveness of an element of agriculture that is often overlooked: American aquaculture. Some experts estimate that to meet the demand for healthy, fresh aquacultural products, global production will have to double in the next 40 years. Yet in spite of this skyrocketing demand, America is at risk of being left behind by other nations who have thus far exhibited greater foresight than  we have; putting into place a comprehensive infrastructure for sustainable seafood. While it is true that American aquaculture sales exceeded an impressive one billion dollars in 2005, this was a pittance when compared to the $70 billion market worldwide. In fact, in 2006 the U.S. had a trade deficit in seafood production of $9.1 billion. With demand rising so dramatically globally and, in particular, here at home, we cannot afford to fall behind any further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have taken this opportunity to introduce the National Aquatic Animal Health Act. This legislation will begin the process of creating a national infrastructure that will attract investment, protect the valuable stocks of our aquaculture farmers from disease, and create a unique, flexible partnership between the Federal Government, State agencies, and industry groups. Dedicated to proactively monitoring seafood stocks for disease, this program will employ the resources and vast field  experience of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, coupled with experts on disease at various State agriculture and marine agencies and industry professionals to certify the health of all participating aquaculture species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeled after similar animal monitoring programs already in place at APHIS, this program will provide a nationwide set of standards, the kind of uniformity that is currently absent in the aquaculture community. Instead, a myriad of jurisdictional conflicts and competing regulations among various states creates uncertainty and erects impediments to interstate commerce. But this bill is not a set of onerous regulations imposed upon the private sector by a federal agency; under the legislation,  states are required to opt-in to the program. They must choose to utilize the assets available in this legislation to assist in preserving that state's particular aquaculture products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Maine has tremendously benefited from aquaculture. There are nearly three dozen hatcheries in the State, handling both finfish and shellfish. Our 3,500 miles of coastline has served as an ideal incubator for the expansion of the aquaculture industry. The total economic activity generated from the industry State-wide was over $130 million last year, providing jobs for over 1,000 hard-working Mainers. This sort of productivity was not always the case. In 2001, nearly all the salmon  stocks in Maine had to be eliminated due to an outbreak of a crippling, infectious disease known as ISA. It took the industry years to recover. Now, the Great Lakes face the threat of the virulent pathogen known as VHS. It is my hope that with swift passage of this legislation, we will no longer</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 2300. A bill to improve the Small Business Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2300">S. 2300</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing legislation, the Small Business Contracting Revitalization Act of 2007, designed to protect the interests of small businesses in the Federal marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have focused a considerable amount of energy promoting the interests of small businesses in the Federal marketplace. The legislation that we are introducing today marks a critical step forward in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship places a great deal of importance on moving legislation forward in a bipartisan manner, the members of my Committee understand we represent the interests of all of our Nation's small businesses, the most important and dynamic segment of our economy. And nowhere is the bipartisan consensus stronger than in the area of Federal procurement and ensuring that our Nation's small businesses receive their fair share of procurement  opportunities. I am pleased to once again be introducing bipartisan legislation with the Committee's ranking member, Senator Olympia Snowe. Regardless of who has chaired the Committee during our tenure together, we have both worked hard to improve small business Federal procurement opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are introducing today has one ultimate purpose, to expand opportunities for small businesses to contract with the Federal government. And the reality is that small businesses need all the help they can get with respect to accessing the Federal marketplace. In fiscal year 2006 according to Eagle Eye Publishing, the Federal Government missed its 23 percent contracting goal by 3 percent. That 3 percent represents more than $12 billion in lost contracting dollars for small businesses.  Service-disabled veterans fared the worst when it came to Federal contracting with only 0.87 percent of Federal dollars going to their firms. Women-owned firms only took in 2.57 percent of Federal dollars while they make up more than 30 percent of all privately held firms. Minority-owned firms continue to face barriers to Federal contracting. The SDB and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first area we attempt to make improvements in is the area of contract bundling. Although contracting bundling may have started out as a good idea it has now become the prime example of the old saying that too much of a good thing can be very, very bad. The proliferation of bundled contracts coupled with a decimation of contracting professionals within the Government threatens to kill small businesses' ability to compete for Federal contracts. In our hearing on July 18, 2007, on contracting,  we heard testimony about the damage to opportunities for small businesses because of the lack of oversight and contract bundling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill looks to address those issues by ensuring: accountability of senior agency management for all incidents of bundling; timely and accurate reporting of contract bundling information by all Federal agencies; and improved oversight of bundling regulation compliance by the Small Business Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also ensures that contract consolidation decisions made by a department or agency, other than the Defense Department and its agencies, provide small businesses with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second area that this bill attempts to address is subcontracting. The Committee heard in the July 18 hearing and in a May 22, 2007, hearing on minority business about the challenges that many small business subcontractors face when dealing with  prime contractors. Witnesses related that the way subcontracting compliance is calculated creates opportunity for abuse. They also related that many small businesses will spend time, money and effort preparing  bid proposals to be a part of a bid team and that once the contract is won they never hear from the prime contractor again. Many also complain about lack of timely payments after they have completed work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill attempts to deal with some of these issues by including provisions designed to prevent misrepresentations in subcontracting by prime contractors. To accomplish this, the bill: provides guidelines and procedures for reviewing and evaluating subcontractor participation in prime contracts; authorizes agency pilot programs that will grant contractual incentives to prime contractors who exceed their small business goals; and requires prime contractors who fail to comply with subcontracting  plans to fund mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; assistance programs for small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third area that our legislation attempts to address is the updating of the socioeconomic programs administered by the SBA. In our first hearing of the year on January 31, 2007, we heard veterans with service connected disabilities speak about the difficulty that they are having accessing the Federal marketplace. It is clear that the Government is not doing enough. In fiscal year 2006, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses only got 0.87 percent of all Federal procurement--well short of  the 3 percent statutory goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will assist service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in obtaining Government contract and subcontract opportunities by expanding the authority for sole-source awards to SDV firms. In addition, the bill will allow: the surviving spouse of a service-disabled veteran to retain the business's SDV designation for up to 10 years following the veteran's death; the SBA to accept SDV firm certifications from the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the establishment of an SDV mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;  program by the SBA. Our veterans are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we owe it to them to give them every opportunity at fulfilling the dream of entrepreneurship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard from women business owners in our September 20, 2007, hearing, on women's entrepreneurship that the time has come to implement the women's procurement program. The administration has continually postponed implementing a women's procurement program that became law 7 years ago. This bill tells SBA to get it done within 90 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another program sorely needing our attention is the 8(a) program. This program was created to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, but, as we heard during the May 22, 2007, hearing, the financial threshold for inclusion in the program is out-dated and too restrictive. The net-worth thresholds have not been updated since 1989. This bill allows for an inflationary adjustment to be made to the threshold and it excludes qualified retirement accounts from consideration  while calculating the threshold so that businesses that belong in this program won't be shut out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also makes a number of changes to the HUBZone program. The bill would expand HUBZones to areas adjacent to military installations affected by BRAC. It will also make other changes that will expand the HUBZone program to subcontracting as well as creating a mentor protege program. I understand the stated goal of this program is to develop areas of poverty through government contracting. And while I agree that this is a laudable goal I also remember the controversy that surrounded the  creation of this program in 1996. I am keenly aware that the HUBZone program was created to supplant race-conscious programs like 8(a) and the small disadvantaged business program. I fought hard to preserve those programs then and I will continue to preserve and strengthen those programs in the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fourth area that we intend to update is the acquisition process. This bill aims to increase the number of small business contracting opportunities by including additional provisions to reduce bundled contracts and by reserving more contracts for small business concerns. The bill accomplishes this by: authorizing small business set-asides in multiple-award, multi-agency contracting vehicles; and requiring that agencies include advance plans on small business spending in their budgets and submit  a report describing the impact of each bundled contract awarded by an agency. The bill also directs the SBA to annually report to Congress on small business participation in overseas Government contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last area that we tackle in this legislation is small business size and status integrity. The Committee has heard from a number of small businesses about large businesses parading as small businesses. During our July hearing we looked at the list of the top 25 small businesses doing Federal contracting. On that list at least six clearly recognizable multi-billion dollar corporations were among the top 25 small businesses listed including SAIC at number two. I have been adamant that small  business contracts must go to small businesses. Small businesses are losing billions of dollars in opportunities because of these size standard loopholes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill attempts to address these issues by adding a new section, Sec. 38, to the Small Business Act that is designed to strengthen the Government's ability to enforce the size and status standards for small business certification. To achieve this, the new section establishes procedures for protests, through the SBA, of small business set-aside awards made to large businesses; requires the development of training programs for small business size standards; requires a government-wide policy  on prosecutions of size and status fraud; and requires a detailed review of the size standards for small businesses by the SBA within 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a truly bi-partisan effort and we look forward to working with the rest of the Senate as we move this legislation forward. It is well past time to provide greater opportunities for the thousands of small business owners who wish to do business with the Federal government. I believe that this legislation is a good step toward opening those doors of opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this bill Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. </paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="TITLE V--SMALL BUSINESS SIZE AND STATUS INTEGRITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to introduce, with Chairman KERRY, the Small Business Contracting Revitalization Act of 2007. This critical legislation is a product of consensus-building and compromise over the past few years and truly reflects the bipartisan nature of our Committee. Thank you, Chairman KERRY, for working to make this a truly bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation addresses the numerous barriers facing small businesses in securing their fair share of Federal contracting dollars. Currently, small businesses are eligible for $340 billion in Federal contracting dollars, yet receive only $77 billion. Regrettably, the Federal Government consistently fails to satisfy its 23 percent small business goal resulting in small businesses losing billions of dollars in contracting opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am dismayed by the myriad ways that Government agencies have time and again egregiously failed to achieve  most of their small business statutory "goaling" requirements. For example, in fiscal year 2006, the Historically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, program met only 2.1 percent of its three percent goal, while our Nation's service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses received a Government-wide, paltry total of only 0.9 percent of its  three percent small business goal. This longstanding area of concern is coupled with a litany of deficiencies that include "contract bundling," sub-contracting misrepresentations, inaccurate small business size determinations, flawed reporting data, and under-utilization of key small business contracting programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Chairman is well aware, these problems are not new, and our Committee has held countless hearings on various contracting concerns throughout the years. Business opportunities through Federal contracts provide vital economic benefits for small businesses, which is why last year, my Small Business Administration Reauthorization Bill, which passed our Committee unanimously, contained a robust package of small business contracting initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation builds on the contracting provisions of that bill, by improving all of the small business contracting programs--including the HUBZone, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business programs. It equips the SBA with additional tools to meet the demands of an ever-changing 21st century contracting environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan measure also includes several other priorities that I have long championed--most notably, enhancing the HUBZone program. In my home state of Maine, only 118 of 41,026 small businesses are qualified HUBZone businesses. HUBZones represent a tremendous tool for replacing lost jobs for our Nation's declining manufacturing and industrial sectors--clearly, this program should be better utilized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bipartisan small business contracting legislation to ensure that all small business "goals" are not only met--but exceeded.</paragraph>
