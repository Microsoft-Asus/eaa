    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, Democrats passed a comprehensive solution to the country's energy crisis, but for all of their talk about solving this problem, Republicans still oppose the effort. It's no surprise the Republicans are against this commonsense energy plan. The plan makes Big Oil pay royalties on land they've leased for years so Americans can start benefiting from oil companies drilling on our land. That's only fair. It is the American people's land. Shouldn't they get some  of the benefits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation also repeals tax breaks and subsidies that Big Oil has been getting for years, thanks to the Washington Republicans. Every quarter, Big Oil is announcing larger profits. They don't need corporate welfare. This comprehensive energy legislation will help people--those middle class Americans suffering from high gas prices and dealing with the failed Bush-McCain economy at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Tuesday's energy vote shows that Democrats are working to help the American people, not lining the pockets of Big Oil.</paragraph>
