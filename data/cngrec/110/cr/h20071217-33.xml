    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on this measure and on <bill type="s" number="2174">S. 2174</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>, sponsored by Chairman Ed Towns, would permit State and local governments to purchase homeland security and public safety equipment from the Federal supply schedules maintained by the General Services Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opening the Federal supply schedules to State and local governments has bipartisan support. In past years, contract schedules have been opened up for information technology and goods and services needed to respond or prevent terrorism to State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State and local governments should be able to enjoy the price and convenience advantages that the schedules provide. I commend my colleague for his leadership and urge Members to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>, the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act. Mr. Towns and the entire Committee on Oversight and Government Reform recognized that the GSA schedule is more than just a list of things that can be bought at a given price. It is, in fact, the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GSA goes to great lengths to ensure that products are appropriate for purchase and that they are a good value. Leveraging that capability and the Federal money already spent to allow States and local governments to participate in this acquisition serves two good purposes. It increases the value of seeking a GSA schedule, and in fact, it saves money and overhead for State and local agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleague from the District of Columbia and Mr. Towns in asking for the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to yield such time as he may consume to my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia for her friendship and thank her for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to offer my support for <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>, the matter that has been introduced by Mr. Towns of New York, which is entitled the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act. This is a fine piece of legislation, and I urge our colleagues to vote "yes" on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one word more on this resolution introduced by Mr. Towns. I am Chair of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over GSA and, of course, its schedule. Perhaps the average person would believe that States would be in the same position as the United States Government because they buy a great deal of goods and services and the same kinds of costs and scale and efficiency which comes with ordering large amounts at the same time would come to States as well. That's not  always the case, and even if it is, there is no State as large or that orders as much as the United States of America. And it does seem to me altogether appropriate that States and localities have the same access to the GSA schedule as the United States and its agencies have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This ability to use the schedule on which firms have precompeted so as to guarantee the best value hastens what can be an arduous period of competition. In my own district, I see that in an effort to make sure that a competition has properly occurred, there can often be many delays. We cannot, of course, in some respects get around those inherent delays, but with respect to many goods and services that are on the GSA schedule, if the efficiencies that we are able to provide for the government  can also be provided to States and localities, the United States and the States together will be in better shape saving taxpayers money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I strongly support this bill and ask other Members of the House to do so as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>, the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act. This is a bipartisan, good government bill that will permit state apd local governments to purchase homeland security and public safety equipment using General Services Administration contract schedules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill> has the support of many state and local governments and the National Association of Counties. It will make it easier for  local officials to purchase the items they need to improve safety in their communities, while saving money at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GSA Schedules are catalogues of more than 4 million commercial goods and services currently available to federal agencies at negotiated discount prices. Since 2002, Congress has enacted "cooperative purchasing" legislation that authorized state and local governments to purchase IT equipment and disaster recovery items from GSA schedules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill further expands that authority to purchase items such as bomb detection equipment, perimeter security systems, and other homeland security goods and services from GSA Schedule 84.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that this bill imposes no federal mandate and requires no new spending. Participation in the cooperative purchasing program is voluntary for both state and local governments and vendors. The analysis prepared by the Congressional Budget Office indicates that the bill has no net impact on federal spending and is the opposite of an unfunded mandate--in fact, it is a benefit to state and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was developed jointly with the ranking member of the Government Management Subcommittee, Mr. BILBRAY. I thank him for his contribution to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>, the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act. I am pleased to serve as the original cosponsor of this legislation. I also want thank Congressman TOWNS for his leadership in sponsoring and advancing this important idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill> will allow State and local governments to purchase homeland security products and services at more reasonable prices by providing them access to the General Services Administration schedules. Following the attacks on September 11, our local and State governments have taken on more responsibility for emergency preparedness and homeland security. With this added responsibility, these local governments need to purchase a wider array of goods and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this legislation, these localities will be able to purchase many products such as access control and perimeter security systems, fire detection and suppression equipment, firefighting clothing and marine craft from the GSA schedules. With this option, the cost of many of these products will be less than the cost of purchasing them from State-approved purchasing lists or the open marketplace, saving these local governments valuable tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, this legislation does not impose any requirements on States and localities to utilize the GSA schedules, instead offering an additional voluntary purchasing method.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has strong bipartisan support and was passed out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee by voice vote. Additionally, it has gained the endorsement of the National Association of Counties and many other outside organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill>, the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act, introduced by my distinguished colleague from New York, Representative TOWNS. This important legislation amends title 40 of the United States Code to authorize the use of Federal supply schedules for the acquisition of law enforcement, security, and certain other related items by State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the post-September 11 era, with the advances in technology, communication and transportation, the likelihood of a situation escalating from an emergency to a disaster to a catastrophe has increased. This Nation is dependent upon the services of its first responders, and as such we cannot shirk responsibility for their well being when we put them in harm's way. Since the catastrophe of September 11, 2001, the need to anticipate and provide necessary resources to our emergency workers has been  brought to Federal attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has a responsibility to plan ahead and develop a strategy of what will occur should a catastrophic event ever take place. As can be seen with the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Monitoring Program, which was established in 2004 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, it has been insecure in its funding since its inception and is estimated to be out of outpatient awards by the end of FY 2007. This type of haphazard funding and insecurity  about the program's future is not what our first responders risked their lives for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to enact any meaningful change, we must understand and identify the unique situations that face our first responders and then try to address any preventative pre-emptive actions that are possible. This includes Federal inquiry into the recognition and management of mental health defects, plans for short- and long-term health monitoring, quality of personal protective equipment, proposed research or lack thereof, and the national response plan. The necessity of inquiry into and improvement  and solidification of these issues cannot be overstressed in looking to the future and how our Nation will deal with caring for the first responders during a disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we witnessed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, our Nation's first responders were not prepared for the realities of the catastrophes they faced. We can ensure future safety and protection of our first responders by making sure their personal protective equipment is sufficient to handle any future risks. It is our obligation to make sure the funds for the proper equipment is being received through Federal grant programs  so that in the case of a catastrophe, they will be able to safely respond to hazardous materials, biological agents, and other harmful materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is important because it amends title 40 of the United States Code to provide necessary equipment to our Nation's first responders. In the wake of the tragedies of September 11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the necessity for the provision of appropriate technologies, including interoperable communications and the availability of emergency equipment, became painfully apparent. This legislation calls for the availability and provision of alarm and signal systems, facility management  systems, firefighting and rescue equipment, law enforcement and security equipment, marine craft and related equipment, special purpose clothing, and related services. By amending title 40 of the United States Code, this legislation is an important step towards ensuring that America's first responders are adequately prepared for any situation that may arise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support the passage of <bill type="h" number="3179">H.R. 3179</bill> and call on my colleagues to do likewise because I strongly believe that it will strengthen our Nation's efforts to confront the disasters.</paragraph>
