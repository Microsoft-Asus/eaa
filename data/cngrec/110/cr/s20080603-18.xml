  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues an important development in Asia with implications for regional security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malaysia, a moderate country of 27 million people with an Islamic majority, has long been a major high-tech manufacturing center, producing components of goods that are in personal computers and household items throughout our country, as well as throughout the world. It is encouraging to see economic reforms now complemented by political ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to a call for change voiced by the people in the March 8 Malaysian elections, in which opposition candidates made gains in Parliament, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi has proposed a series of significant reforms to promote a more independent and effective judiciary and to increase anticorruption efforts across Malaysia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of judicial reform, Prime Minister Badawi has proposed a new Judicial Appointments Commission to identify, recommend and evaluate candidates for the judiciary based on clearly defined criteria. He has also offered a proposal to improve the quality of judges by reviewing the compensation and terms of service for judges to attract and retain the most qualified judges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the major public concern about corruption in Malaysia, Mr. Badawi has taken steps to make Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Agency, ACA,  become a fully supported and independent commission with an independent corruption prevention advisory board. He has also undertaken action intended to triple the number of anticorruption officers, and to establish a parliamentary committee on corruption prevention that would review annual reports by the ACA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Badawi's reform proposals also include greater support and protections for freedom of the press, including issuing one-time--rather than annual--licenses for media organizations and approving a permit for the party of main opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's People's Justice Party to publish its own newspaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malaysia's pursuit of democracy and its struggle against Islamic extremism are critical for establishing lasting peace, prosperity, and security both for the Malaysian people and for the entire Southeast Asian region. The future direction of countries such as Malaysia is of significant importance to the United States as we work with others to fight extremists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The relationship between these types of reforms and security in Malaysia and the surrounding region is the subject of a recent op-ed in the Providence Journal by Stuart Eizenstat, who served as Undersecretary of State and Deputy Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration. This editorial, which I am submitting for the Record, also notes Mr. Badawi's initiative to have Muslim states which are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, commit themselves to  a joint plan to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and unemployment in the Islamic world. Attention to that kind of investment in basic social needs in the Islamic world is an essential element of combating extremism. Human security requires protection not only of law and freedom, but of economic security, and I commend Mr. Eizenstat's article for its recognition of how these issues intersect in the current reform efforts being undertaken in Malaysia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I referred be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Malaysian Democracy's Role in Terror Fight </narrative>
  <narrative>(By Stuart E. Eizenstat)</narrative>
  <narrative>There is a titanic conflict within the Muslim world pitting modernity against reactionary radicalism.</narrative>
  <narrative>Muslim leaders who promote modernization and integration with the world economy will only succeed if their policies will lead to a better way of life for their people.</narrative>
  <narrative>The next U.S. president must determine how best to support the reformers, which will require new approaches, a combination of both hard and soft U.S. power, and most importantly, strong, reliable allies.</narrative>
  <narrative>That's why it is so important for the U.S. to pay attention to the transformation now occurring in Malaysia, a Muslim nation of some 27 million people whose prime minister, Abdullah Badawi, has responded to electoral calls for change by introducing sweeping reforms designed to maintain a democratic open society for the long term.</narrative>
  <narrative>On March 8, Malaysian voters sent a strong message to the government by giving opposition parties solid gains in parliament--even as Badawi's party continued to hold more than 60 percent of the seats.</narrative>
  <narrative>Instead of heeding the calls of his adversaries to resign, Prime Minister Badawi embraced the call of voters who demanded reform. The results: Badawi's avalanche of proposals has begun positioning him as the 68-year-old "comeback kid" of Malaysia politics.</narrative>
  <narrative>The reforms have addressed three central foundations for freedom too often not seen in developing nations--and especially those in the Islamic world.</narrative>
  <narrative>First, Badawi has moved to strengthen the independence of Malaysia's judiciary, by creating a process to create merit-based lists of judicial candidates, similar to the kinds of vetting systems used in the U.S. to rate potential new federal judges.</narrative>
  <narrative>Second, Badawi is building on strategies adopted in Hong Kong and Singapore to create independent bodies to combat corruption.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, Badawi is opening up historically strict licensing processes to promote freedom of the press, making it possible for the newly empowered political opposition to publish its own newspaper.</narrative>
  <narrative>These new reforms would fundamentally change the way business--and politics--are carried out in a nation whose political leadership had historically emphasized economic development rather than political freedom. By making the country's institutions more transparent and independent, the Badawi government is promoting a system that is also more likely to be resilient in turbulent economic times.</narrative>
  <narrative>The stability of this majority Muslim nation through political and economic change has significant implications for the U.S., for whom Malaysia is the 10th largest trading partner.</narrative>
  <narrative>Malaysia is an important producer for the U.S. of components for high-tech business and consumer goods, like computers and cell phones. It also has provided a steady example of a Muslim government that has been serious about combating terrorism at home. And it has burnished Badawi's reputation as a leader of Islamic moderates against the life-support systems that sustain the dark forces of Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and the terror network that stretches from Northern Africa across the Middle  East into Southeast Asia.</narrative>
  <narrative>Other Muslim leaders, including those of some of the opposition parties in Malaysia, have a different vision, one that would reverse Badawi's goal of converting Malaysia into a multi-cultural Islamic-oriented state that is helping to modernize Islam in ways that are compatible with the globalizing challenges of the 21st Century.</narrative>
  <narrative>For example, Malaysia's Parti Islam se Malaysia (PAS) has called for the imposition of a criminal code of Islamic law, or Shariah, including such cruel punishments as amputation and death by stoning, reversing hard-won women's rights and an end to race-oriented affirmative-action programs aimed at helping improve the lives of Malaysia's minorities.</narrative>
  <narrative>Malaysia and Badawi have sought to lead by example in the region. During his recently concluded chairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic Conference--an international organization of 57 Muslim states from the Middle East to Indonesia--he led efforts to address the twin challenges of poverty and illiteracy that fuel the spread of Islamic extremism in the Muslim world.</narrative>
  <narrative>Badawi has challenged his fellow Muslim states, including those which are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), to commit themselves to a joint plan to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and unemployment in the Islamic world.</narrative>
  <narrative>His persistence in helping to establish a new economic agenda for the Muslim world represents a critical initiative in the long-term struggle to transform impoverished Muslim states into nations that find their place in a progressive, globalizing world.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the end, whether Badawi's dexterity will keep him in power to serve a full term is yet to be determined, but what he has set in motion deserves the support of the United States, since his reforms will place Malaysia firmly on the path to modernizing its Islamic society.</narrative>
  <narrative>Stuart E. Eizenstat was chief domestic-policy adviser to President Jimmy Carter, and held several senior positions in the Clinton administration.</narrative>
