  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a singularly important piece of legislation which I bring to my colleagues with great personal enthusiasm and some fond memories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first pay tribute to our late colleague, Senator Paul Simon, after whom this legislation is named. Paul was a firm champion not only of education, higher education, but also education abroad, this incredibly important aspect in a growingly interdependent world. It is appropriate that this piece of legislation be named after our great late colleague, Paul Simon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for 10 years, first I established and then I had the privilege of directing the Study Abroad Program of the California State University and College System. When I established that program, it was a path-breaking enterprise because historically study abroad was the privilege of only the wealthy and those who attended uniquely elite institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation expands the opportunity for study abroad that hopefully will involve annually about a million of our college and university students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not too many years ago, study abroad was the opportunity for some wealthy college students to spend some time in France or Italy or maybe in Germany. But in an increasingly globalized world, our need to have young men and women who are conversant in the languages of many countries and who are familiar with the cultures of many countries is an absolute necessity for our national security and our national well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic piece of legislation will democratize the program of Study Abroad, which used to be the privilege of a very thin layer of our society. It opens up for every American college student, irrespective of his or her socioeconomic status, the opportunity of spending a year or more involved in serious language and area study all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>At a time when new languages are required by vast numbers of our young people, Chinese, Indian, Arabic and others, this will provide a dramatic upgrading of our ability to interact with the rest of the globe. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation which will usher in a new era for American higher education for college students all over the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that an exchange of letters between the Committee of Foreign Affairs and the Committee of Oversight and Government Reform be included in the Record at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, June 5, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN LANTOS: I am writing about <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, a bill to establish the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs reported this legislation to the House on May 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your effort to consult with the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding those provisions of <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill> that fall within the Oversight Committee's jurisdiction. These provisions address issues related to the Federal civil service, Federal property management, and the duties of inspectors general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of expediting consideration of <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, the Oversight Committee will not request a sequential referral of this bill. I would, however, request your support for the appointment of conferees from the Oversight Committee should <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill> or a similar Senate bill be considered in conference with the Senate. Moreover, this letter should not be construed as a waiver of the Oversight Committee's legislative jurisdiction over subjects addressed in <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill> that fall within the jurisdiction  of the Oversight Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please include our exchange of letters on this matter in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD during consideration of this legislation on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I appreciate your willingness to consult the Committee on these matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HENRY A. WAXMAN,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, June 5, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter regarding <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I acknowledge that the Committee will not seek a sequential referral of the bill and agree that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not in any way serve as a jurisdictional precedent as to our two committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, as to any House-Senate conference on the bill, I understand that your Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees for consideration of portions of the bill that are within the Committee's jurisdiction, and I agree to support a request by the Committee with respect to serving as conferees on the bill, consistent with the Speaker's practice in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will ensure that our exchange of letters are included in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and I look forward to working with you on this important legislation. If you wish to discuss this matter further, please contact me or have your staff contact my staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cordially,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM LANTOS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to join Chairman Lantos in introducing his bill, <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2007. The Act gives effect to key recommendations of the bipartisan, congressionally mandated report of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission as well as the 9/11 Commission report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has an increasing need for foreign language expertise, cultural knowledge and better people-to-people diplomacy. We saw a dramatic example of this need, lamentably, after the events of 9/11 when we faced a sudden shortage of qualified speakers of Arabic, Farsi and other strategic languages. A study released last August by the Government Accountability Office indicated that serious language gaps remain within the State Department that can adversely impact State's ability to communicate  with foreign audiences and execute critical duties. Study abroad by more American students in places other than traditional destinations in western Europe is essential to our Nation's security and future leadership in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, the gentleman from California's bill, <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, aims to increase the number and diversity of American students studying abroad with an eventual goal of 1 million per year. It ensures that most of the increase occurs in nontraditional and strategically important destinations, such as China, the Middle East and the developing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Act will establish the Simon Study Abroad Foundation, an independent U.S. Government corporation that can raise private sector funds to promote its work, freed from the large bureaucracies and short-term agendas of other U.S. agencies. By offering competitive grants to universities and educational consortiums based on its priorities, the Foundation will generate broader interest among American schools in study abroad programs, leveraging an impact far greater than a mere direct grant program  for students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure maximum transparency and efficiency, the Foundation will be subject to oversight by an Inspector General and annual congressional reporting requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Chairman Lantos incorporating my proposals for those oversight mechanisms in the introduced text of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also was pleased to consult with him regarding the small changes made to the bill after committee consideration. Three minor changes make explicit what was already implicit in the bill: Two of them confirm that the Foundation is a new and different approach not intended to supplant other exchange and direct-grant programs currently run by the State Department. The third makes clear that the Foundation should take care to fund only safe, high-quality study abroad programs. A fourth, substantive  change aims to make the Foundation more  cost-effective by eliminating the compensation for board members that was part of the originally introduced text.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, this Act, Mr. Speaker, represents a creative, forward-thinking initiative to protect American leadership and security in a fast-changing world. <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill> deserves our enthusiastic support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no additional requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Act of 2007. This important piece of legislation seeks to enhance the enrollment, diversity, and range of countries relating to U.S. college study abroad programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States is failing to take full advantage of a valuable tool that should be used to enhance our standing in the world and to improve our national security. Opportunities for students to study abroad is integral to creating intercultural awareness, a globally competent workforce, ensuring America's economic competitiveness, and protecting national security. Students can be powerfully effective diplomats for American culture, democratic values, and foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill> aims to improve the diversity, the range of countries, and number of students that study abroad while in college. Only about 1 percent of all U.S. college students study abroad, and the vast majority study in Europe. Just 9 percent of those students are minority students, even though African American, Native American, and Hispanic students make up 30 percent of the total U.S. college enrollment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and the congressionally chartered Lincoln Commission, the Senator Paul Simon Act will create a new government corporation charged with democratizing study abroad for American students the way that the GI Bill democratized higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Simon Foundation Act is visionary legislation sponsored by Senators Richard Durbin and Norm Coleman, and the chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. The legislation authorizes $80 million annually for 10 years in order to assist 1 million American students study abroad each year by 2018. This funding from the Department of State budget will directly support student scholarships and organizations  like Bardoli Global around the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bardoli Global is an organization that originated in my congressional district. It exists to provide greater access to study abroad opportunities for outstanding African American, Native American, and Hispanic American student leaders and to make those students globally competent change agents for their communities. The organization's Houston pilot program will soon expand to five other cities across the Nation in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must act now to enact the vision of the late Senator Paul Simon from Illinois who worked tirelessly to promote a public-private partnership to democratize study abroad. We must act quickly to achieve equity and diversity in study abroad, especially targeting traditionally underrepresented students. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as always, it's a pleasure to work with Chairman Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no further requests for speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1469">H.R. 1469</bill>, as amended.</chair>
