  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank our Nation's veterans and their families for their dedication, their service and their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach Veterans Day, I commend the Democratic leadership for working with our Senate colleagues to pass a Veterans appropriations bill last night. This bill is the largest increase in veterans funding ever, $3.7 billion over what the President asked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will provide our veterans with desperately needed health care services, including funds specifically allocated to treat the rising number of veterans with traumatic brain injury and PTSD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, we have lost more than 4,000 troops and 30,000 troops have been wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq. We must do everything we can to take care of our servicemembers when they come home to their families and their communities, and we will bring them home. But until that day, this Congress will do everything we can to take care of our veterans and their families.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
