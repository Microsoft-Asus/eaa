  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12453">S12453</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>This morning, following the time Senator McConnell and I may use, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour. The time is equally divided and controlled. The majority will control the first half; Republicans will control the final half. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill>, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, and then conduct up to 30 minutes of debate with respect to the Graham amendment relating to emergency  funding for border security. A vote in relation to that amendment will occur once the time is used or yielded back, around 11 or shortly thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I speak for the managers when I say that if Members have any amendments, they better get here because Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye won't wait. In fact, I think they will ask consent when the bill is on the floor that at a certain time, if no other amendments are offered, the only amendments in order would be those filed up to that time. Cloture was filed--not that it is necessary. We hope it isn't. I hope we can finish this bill today. I have had a short conversation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think at that stage--and I told the Republican leader--we are going to start conferences on all these bills we have passed, four already, starting today. We need to be in a position where we can start sending some of these bills to the President. As I indicated, I will confer with the Republican leader as to which ones we should send out first. We need to get moving along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to do everything within our ability to try to finish our work by November 16. That is not going to be easy, but we should try. As I have indicated previously, there are a lot of things left to be done prior to the Senate recessing on November 16 and work to be done prior to our recess--hopefully, tomorrow--dealing with various work we think we can do by unanimous consent. I urge Members to continue the level of cooperation we have witnessed, as we consider other appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also explained this to Senator McConnell, my desires in that regard; that is, as soon as we get back, that we start to complete the Labor-HHS bill. Before we leave here this week, we are going to do a circuit judge and a number of district court judges.</paragraph>
