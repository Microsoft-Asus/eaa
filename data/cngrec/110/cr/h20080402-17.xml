    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during my time in this job, I have met with many Utah families, teachers and health professionals about their struggle with autism. I have visited the special education classrooms where dedicated teachers work with youngsters who have been diagnosed as autistic, as well as met with families desperately searching out medical options for their children. I have learned from this that more data, more research and more public education are imperative in order to help these  families create a future for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Utah, one in every 133 kids has autism. That is the third highest rate among 14 States, according to a 2007 CDC study. Nationally, 67 children are diagnosed with autism every single day, which costs our country $90 billion a year. I am humbled to represent the Utah family that has the highest number of cases of autism in a single-family in the entire United States, six children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Autism Caucus and as a cosponsor of the resolution declaring April National Autism Month, I have been a strong advocate for increased research dollars to help us provide more answers about this disorder and the hardship it inflicts on families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Awareness is only a first step, but every step forward brings us closer I hope to improved diagnosis and treatment of autism.</paragraph>
