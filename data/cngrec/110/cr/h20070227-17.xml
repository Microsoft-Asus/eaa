    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="42">H. Res. 42</bill>) recognizing Ann Richards' extraordinary contributions to Texas and American public life.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the memorial service of Ann Richards, the former mayor of Dallas, Texas, Ron Kirk, the mayor's lifelong friend said, "Ann Richards was as fierce a warrior and advocate for justice as any public servant I've ever known. She embraced every person she met, no matter their station in life, with dignity, and love, and compassion."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The former Governor of Texas was a witty, flamboyant and outspoken homemaker who captured the hearts and minds of the people of Texas, as well as the Nation. She burst into national prominence as a keynote speaker to the 1988 Democratic National Convention when she uttered the famous line about the wealthy, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, and she said, "Poor George, he can't help it; he was born with a silver foot in his mouth." The speech set the tone for her political future as the  first woman elected to treasurer, a statewide office, in Texas in 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, Ann Richards won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination against attorney general and former Congressman Jim Mattox and former Governor Mark White. Her Republican opponent was multimillionaire rancher Clayton Williams, Jr. The campaign between the two was brutal, but Richards prevailed in the election on November 6, 1990, by a margin of 49-47 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Governor, Ann Richards wanted a more inclusive Texas. She called it the "New Texas," where she made nearly 3,000 appointments, 46 percent were female, 15 percent were African American, 20 percent were Hispanic and 2 percent were Asian Americans. Among Governor Richards' appointment of firsts are: the first African American to the University of Texas regent; the first crime victim to join the State criminal justice board; the first disabled person to serve on human services board; and the  first teacher to lead the State board of education. During her tenure, she oversaw the fabled Texas Rangers pin stars on their first African American and female officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richards implemented an economic revitalization program to address the Texas economy that was in a slump since the mid-1980s, compounded by a downturn in the U.S. economy. Her policy initiatives yielded a 2 percent growth in 1991 for the Texas economy, while the U.S. economy as a whole shrank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann Richards reformed the Texas prison system by establishing a substance abuse program for inmates in prison and reduced the number of violent offenders released back into society. She was a supporter of proposals to reduce the sale of semiautomatic  firearms and cop killer bullets in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>She vetoed legislation that would allow people to carry concealed handguns and automatic weapons inside public establishments without the owner's permission. Some political analysts believe that this veto cost her her reelection bid for Governor in 1994. Richards lost her reelection bid to George W. Bush. After her unsuccessful bid for reelection, someone asked her, "What would you have done differently if you knew you would be a one-term Governor?" Richards grinned and said, "Oh, I would  probably have raised more hell."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in recognizing Dorothy Ann Willis Richards' really extraordinary contribution to Texas and to American public life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A steadfast political activist who first entered the political arena as a student at the University of Texas, Ann Richards rose through the political ranks first as a volunteer in State and local political campaigns and ultimately to a national figure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A feminist icon, Ann Richards first came to national attention to many as the Texas State treasurer, when she delivered the keynote address at the 1988 National Democratic Convention. Serving as the Governor of Texas from 1991 to 1995, Governor Richards was widely acknowledged as an inspirational national leader, civil rights advocate, and role model. Her political philosophy was one of government openness and was noted for her unprecedented appointments of women and minorities to important positions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her life, Governor Richards had a particular interest in social interests such as advancing women's rights and equality for all groups and individuals. She believed, if given a chance, all women could perform as well or better than men, and I would emphasize she probably thought better than men. She once offered a memorable salute to the achievements of women by reminding her audience, and I love this quote, "Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards  and in high heels."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always willing to use her upbringing as an example for others, she once said that, "Where I grew up, there wasn't much tolerance for self-importance, people who put on airs," and she lived by that philosophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her tenure as Governor, she not only expanded the State's economic base through a program for economic revitalization, but created one of the most inclusive and representative governments in the history of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon after becoming Governor, she sought government efficiency by authorizing comprehensive audits of every State agency, that ultimately saved the taxpayers of Texas reportedly $6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of her interest in law enforcement and her own personal battles with alcoholism, Governor Richards reformed the Texas prison system by establishing a substance abuse program for inmates, decreasing the number of violent offenders released, and increasing prison space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Richards was always tireless in her efforts on behalf of children and education. While Governor, she instituted the Texas lottery as a means of supplementing school funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office, in her final year of life, the Austin Independent School District announced, "The Ann Richards School For Young Women Leaders." Opening in the fall of 2007, this institution will serve as a college preparatory school for girls in grades 6 through 12. The curriculum will focus on math, science, and technology. This initiative is one of many lasting tributes to Governor Richards' all-encompassing devotion to the citizens of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Ann Richards passed away from cancer on September 16, 2006. She was 73 years old, leaving behind a legacy of political achievement and a record of championing equality and justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all Members to join by supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas and the author of this legislation, Representative SOLOMON ORTIZ. </paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. ORTIZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we are here to pay tribute to the life of the late Governor of Texas, Dorothy Ann Willis Richards. And I want to thank Chairman Waxman, the majority leader, and my good friend, DANNY DAVIS, for bringing this bill to the floor, and my colleagues for taking time from their busy schedule to do what we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America and the State of Texas both suffered a great loss on September 13, 2006, when Ann Richards met our Maker after a brave struggle with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing up as the son of migrant workers in segregated South Texas, I was painfully aware of the power dynamics in place that placed those of privilege high above the working poor. Ann Richards sought to turn that tide around. During her service as Governor of Texas, she appointed more females and minorities than any Governor by far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Ann's spunk and her dedication to the people of our beloved State, all the people, that earned her love and admiration of millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following her philosophy of life in public service, "well-behaved women rarely make history," Ann's charm and passion for life propelled her far in the history books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lifelong public servant, Ann began her career as a Texas school teacher. She later served in Austin as Travis County Commissioner and Texas State Treasurer prior to being elected State Governor in a historic campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her entire public service career, Ann remained a teacher, teaching Texans that the advantage of working together benefited the economy of our State. Even today she still teaches us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann Richards is remembered today and always not only for her accomplishments, but also for the way she carried them out. Her disarming wit and wisdom won opponents time and time again. Her big as Texas hair, hearty laugh, piercing blue eyes, and smiling face are unforgettable. She was one of those people you just couldn't help but like, and today I am so happy that they gave us time to honor a great American, a great Governor, and a great friend, Ann Richards.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas with whom I had the good fortune to spend Saturday with at Paul Quinn College where we were discussing the issues related to African American males, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy of an exceptional public servant, the late Governor Ann Richards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Governor Richards passed away in September, I not only lost an esteemed colleague, but a dear and trusted friend. I am proud to say that our friendship endured for more than 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we are from the same hometown. But I didn't meet her there, I met her in Dallas, Texas when she lived there in the 1960s. And then she moved to Austin, and the first thing that she did, she always helped in everybody's campaign, but the first thing she did in Austin was manage Sarah Weddington's campaign for the Texas House, and we won at the same time. Sarah Weddington is the young lawyer that defended Rowe v. Wade before the Supreme Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As women in politics, and especially Ann, we shared some of the same views and many of the same colleagues, and I did encourage her that she had come to her time that she can maybe serve in elective office herself. And we knew that Texans were not that supportive of women running for office, but she ran for the County Commissioner's Court and won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was not afraid to be herself, and she really listened to people and she was supportive of people. Her independent spirit and charm not only won  her votes, but it really generated a great deal of respect. And she often used humor to get her point across, but she did get her point across. People respected her, and they knew that she would work hard on their behalf and there was never a question about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She took pride in her accomplishments as Governor. First she won as Treasurer, and I had the pleasure of running her campaign in Dallas County during that time. But when she won as Governor, it was a very male-dominated situation, and she right away appointed more women and minorities to important boards than anyone else ever had done in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time there were women and minorities on the board of regents of Texas universities all over the State and many other women positions that was on the medical examiners board. Those medical examiners didn't know what had taken place. But she was not afraid to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She utilized the latest technology as Texas Treasurer. When she came into office there was a big deficit, and she hired a consultant to come down and help, and that consultant was Franklin Raines. That is when I first met him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did so much together. And when she was in office and was able to see how to get through those many problems, she earned the support of the business community, which was mostly white men of course. Ann broke her way from the mold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy of an exceptional public servant, the late Governor Ann Richards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Governor Richards passed away in September, I not only lost an esteemed colleague, but a dear and trusted friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to say that our friendship endured for more than 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met Ann Richards in the sixties when she lived in Dallas and was running for Travis County Commissioner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As women in politics, Ann and I shared many of the same views and also many of the same challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Texas in the 1970's wasn't very supportive of women running for political office, so you really had to earn each and every vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann wasn't afraid to be herself, and she compelled people to listen to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her independent spirit and charm not only won her votes, but it garnered respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People respected her, and they knew that she would work hard on their behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann took pride in her accomplishments in the male dominated Texas politics. She had hoped that her success may serve as inspiration to young women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She certainly served as inspiration to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982 Ann successfully ran for Texas State Treasurer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As State Treasurer she utilized the latest technology to transform the Texas Treasury into a modern operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along the way, Ann earned the respect of the business community who appreciated her foresight and vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990 Ann became the first woman Governor of Texas elected in her own right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann broke away from the mold of previous Governors. She wasn't afraid to shake things up and speak her mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her tenure as Governor she was adamant about appointing minorities on state boards and commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann wanted the Texas Government to reflect the diversity and culture of the people of the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann was a hands-on Governor, and she didn't let much get by her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She did her best to eliminate inefficiency and waste within the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She demanded that the Texas government fully serve the people, and she did everything in her power to realize that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had a strong will for justice and fairness for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Richards was one of the finest of Texans that I've ever known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She dedicated herself to the State and the people of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She broke down barriers for women, and made us believe that anything was possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was truly an original, and her absence is immensely felt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recognition she is receiving today is very well deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her many contributions to the State of Texas and to America will not be forgotten.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure now to yield 3 minutes to an individual who had the good fortune to be a close neighbor of Governor Richards, Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400111" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman and my colleagues for this resolution honoring our friend, Ann Richards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the great sense of loss that so many of us continue to feel, I must say that the wonderful gathering that we had last year in Austin for Ann Richards was about the most joyous memorial service that I have ever participated in. There was so much to celebrate about this person, about this life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann came to Austin in the 1970s. She was a true life force. She became our County Commissioner and our State Treasurer before becoming Governor. And during most of my tenure in Congress, I had the good fortune to have her as a next-door neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had a quick wit, but she also had a very warm smile. And it was her smile, her warmth, and her sense of humor that could win over even the most ardent foe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She believed in straight talk. Her candor about her personal life enabled her to tell hard truths in her political life. And in her waning months, she faced her battle with cancer with the same fighting spirit and the same sense of humor that defined her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that there are two places not often the focus of reflecting on Ann Richards' life where her effect is particularly notable. One is in our schools. Until January, I represented Ann Richards Middle School in La Joya, Texas. I could see how those young people from a poor economic area were enriched by their contact with Ann Richards and the inspiration that she provided them with her continued participation long after she completed her tenure as Governor. And, now in Austin, we are starting  the Ann Richards School For Young Women. Its purpose is one that Ann devoted much of her personal life to--inspiring and serving as a mentor for young women. And now, in this school, many middle school girls will find that they too can fulfill their dreams and fully participate in all sectors of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>A former teacher, Ann knew what a difference quality public education could make in the lives of young women and young men, and these institutions serve to remind us of what she accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the second place is with her family. She has two daughters, two sons, who are active participants in the life of our community and of our country. I think that they speak volumes about the kind of mother and the kind of family person that Ann Richards is, and they continue to live the legacy that she established.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She set high standards and inspired countless Americans to do the same. Her loss means that all of us who share her values must redouble our efforts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been able to call Ann Richards a friend of mine and of my family. Just like she inspired millions of young women in Texas and across this Nation, she inspired my oldest daughter, Hillary, who I often took along with me to meetings in Austin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At one meeting with the Governor, Hillary pulled out this yellowed copy of Ann's keynote address to the 1988 Democratic National Convention and proceeded to quote lines back to her. Hillary's favorite line from that speech was one that Ann had popularized in her famously wry tone: "Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." To me, that line epitomizes Ann Richards: skillful, determined, and equal to any man's task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a woman in what had been a man's rough and tumble world of Texas politics, but she never let anything or anyone hold her back. She believed education was the great equalizer. She believed redemption was possible, and she believed that a woman's place was in the dome. She aimed to create a new Texas; and when she broke through that glass ceiling, she reached her hand out to pull women, minorities, and the disadvantaged up with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the yellow rose of Texas, Ann was a beautiful and classic lady. She could also be thorny, though. She told you exactly what you needed to hear, using wit and candor to make her point. Her presence and her laughter could fill a room, even if all you could see was that big white hairdo peeking above the crowd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dorothy Ann Willis Richards is a Texas giant, and I am proud that my  daughters grew up knowing such a strong, independent, and caring woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to leave you with some words from Ann, words that all of us here today should take to heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She said: "The public doesn't like you to mislead or represent yourself to be something you're not ..... They don't ask their public officials to be perfect. They just ask them to be smart, truthful, honest, and to show a modicum of good sense."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann, we'll miss you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it will come as no great surprise that on any issue of policy Ann Richards and I were probably 180 degrees out of phase; but last year, when she received her diagnosis, I sent her a little note telling her that we were thinking about her and praying for her. She sent me a little note back, and I wanted to share that with the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She said: "Thank you for being so thoughtful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"For someone who has cancer, I'm in great shape. Patience has never been my long suit, but I am learning. I am in my third week of treatment and am taking it one day at a time. The M.D. Anderson Hospital is fabulous. It's a whole lot like `Star Wars' with more interesting machines than Buck Rogers ever imagined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Thanks a lot for thinking of me and praying for me. With all that energy directed toward my recovery, how can we miss?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there wasn't much that Ann Richards and I did agree on, but we both agreed on our love for Texas, and we both agreed we only wanted the best for our State. Texas is proud to have had a Governor like Ann Richards. Although oftentimes we were on opposite sides of the issue, she will be missed in my home State of Texas.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have left.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Illinois has 5 1/2  minutes. The gentleman from Connecticut has 15 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent to transfer 10 minutes over to my colleague, if there is need to use that time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Connecticut?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all of us come in contact with individuals who have a way to connect one way or another. Sometimes it is from near, and sometimes it is from afar. I shall never forget the speech that Governor Richards made at the Democratic convention in 1988. You know, speeches are things that you hear a lot of when you are involved in public activity and public office, and you don't always look for anything special when you see another one coming. I mean, sometimes, it is another speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the amount of wit and charm that Ann Richards had and her ability to convey it in such a way that she could make a humorous point that was not always so humorous, but you still got the humor out of it, and whoever it was directed to and at didn't necessarily view it as being offensive, she had the ability to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard speaker after speaker talk about the fact that she appointed this large number of individuals to boards and commissions and made regents out of people and gave them positions that people just didn't sort of expect, because it had not been done before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then she took on a real tough question that some people feel caused her to lose an election, but she probably knew the risk that she was taking, because it had to do with the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, dealing with semiautomatic weapons that the normal average person wouldn't necessarily carry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mean, you wouldn't walk around, even if you wanted to go hunting, with a semiautomatic weapon to shoot rabbits or deer or whatever it is that you would shoot, although I have never believed in shooting that many things any way, unless they were shooting back. Therefore, I was never much of a hunter, because the animals didn't have anything to shoot back with. That was about the only way that I would see myself shooting at them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But she knew the great political risk that she was taking, and not withstanding that risk, held to her guns, held to her position, did not waver, did not back up. That is what real leaders are made of. They don't take positions just to get elected or just to be in office. But they take them based upon principles upon which they believe, ideas and ideology that govern their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the kind of woman that Ann Richards was, and that is why I think she was able to mean so much to so many people, not only in Texas; but she was a great advancement for the women's movement, for enticing more women to run for public office, and, of course, to be elected to public office, and to reach another level of equity, another level of having arrived at a point in history where a woman, a little girl growing up, can believe that she has the possibility of moving not only to Governor  of the State of Texas, but to Speaker of the House of the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to our distinguished Speaker, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Congressman Davis, and thank you for bringing this opportunity to the fore for us to sing the praises of the great Governor of Texas, Ann Richards. I am proud to join you today, Mr. Davis, in honor of Ann Richards, a true pioneer and one of Texas' great daughters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann Richards expanded the realm of what is possible for women. As she loved to say: "A woman's place is in the dome." She is certainly smiling down on us today. As more women than ever rise to elective office, we owe a great debt to Ann Richards for helping to blaze the trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So important was she to the women in Congress who serve here now, as part of my swearing-in festivities, I had a tea honoring Ann Richards in which we reviewed a film of her life in which her beautiful granddaughter, Lily, made a presentation about her grandmother, from which we all drew strength and inspiration about this woman, a true, true pioneer. Ann Richards will be remembered for her devastating wit and gigantic heart, which led her to make real and lasting improvements for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From health care, to education, to opening the doors of government to all, Ann Richards was one of our Nation's most fierce champions for expanding opportunity. Just as Ann was an advocate for all of America's children, she was particularly proud of her own. Ann's daughter Cecile Richards was an essential member of my team when I became leader and has since become President of Planned Parenthood of America. I know Ann was equally proud of her three children, Daniel, Clark and Ellen, and her eight  grandchildren, I mentioned Lily. She was proud of all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope it is a comfort to her entire family that so many people here in the Congress, indeed in the country, remember Ann with great enthusiasm and are grateful for her leadership. She has been gone a number of months now, but it is a loss that we sorely feel. It is a memory that we greatly cherish of a great woman, a leader in our country, and a person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I say to all of us in Congress or in elective office, all of us owe Ann Richards a great debt of gratitude. She is the gold standard for statesmanship, man or woman. Again, we are especially proud of the leadership she provided as a woman leader in our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support, and as an original co-sponsor of <bill type="hr" number="42">H. Res. 42</bill>. This resolution is offered by the Texas Democratic Delegation in the House, chaired by Congressman ORTIZ,  and recognizes the extraordinary contributions of Ann Richards to public life in Texas and the United States. It is both fitting and proper that the People's House pay this tribute to a pioneering and path breaking woman who devoted  her life to serving the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this happy moment stands in stark contrast to that sorrowful morning of September 14, 2006, when I informed the House from this podium of my sad duty to report that an American original and the First Lady of Texas politics, the great Ann Richards, had lost her long and valiant battle with throat cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dorothy Ann Willis Richards began her career in politics in the early 1970s after having raised four children. A Democrat, she served as County Commissioner in Travis County, Texas from 1977 to 1982. Richards was elected to the first of two terms as Texas State Treasurer in 1982. We who knew and loved her will remember her always as a forcefully articulate and an amusingly folksy speaker. She first gained national prominence with her keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National  Convention. In 1990 she was elected governor of Texas, the first woman chief executive of Texas in more than fifty years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dorothy Ann Willis was born in Lakeview, Texas. She grew up in Waco, Texas, and graduated from Waco High School in 1950, participating in Girls State. She received a bachelor's degree from Baylor University while on a debate scholarship. She married her high school sweetheart, David Richards, and moved to Austin, Texas, where she earned a teaching certificate from the University of Texas at Austin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation, she taught social studies and history at Fulmore Junior High School in Austin, Texas from 1955 to 1956. She had also two daughters and two sons in the following years, and she campaigned for Texas liberals and progressives such as Henry B. Gonzalez, Ralph Yarborough, and Sarah Weddington. One of her daughters, Cecile Richards became president of Planned Parenthood in 2006. Throughout her life Ann Richards was a forceful champion for economic and social justice for all Americans,  especially women and the disadvantaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, Richards ran against and defeated a three-term incumbent on the Travis County, Texas Commissioner Court, holding the position for six years. She then was elected State Treasurer in 1982, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in more than fifty years. In winning the Democratic nomination for treasurer, Richards ended the career of a Texas politician with the same name as a president (but no relation), Warren G. Harding. In 1986, she was re-elected treasurer without opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann Richards delivered the keynote address to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, a move which put her in the national spotlight with the line "Poor George [H.W. Bush], he can't help it ..... He was born with a silver foot in his mouth." The speech set the tone for her political future; she described herself as a real Texan (in supposed contrast to George H.W. Bush), established herself as a feminist, and reached out to African-Americans and Hispanics. In 1989, with co-author Peter Knobler,  she wrote her autobiography, Straight from the Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, she sought and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination besting such venerable vote getters as Texas Attorney General James "Jim" Mattox and former governor Mark White. In the general election she defeated multi-millionaire rancher Clayton Williams after a brutal campaign and was inaugurated the 45th governor of Texas in January 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Texas economy had been in a slump since the mid-1980s, compounded by a downturn in the U.S. economy. Governor Richards responded with a program of economic revitalization, yielding growth in 1991 of 2% when the U.S. economy as a whole shrank. She also streamlined Texas's government and regulatory institutions for business and the public. Her efforts helped to revitalize and position Texas's corporate infrastructure for the explosive economic growth it experienced later in the decade. Her  audits on the state bureaucracy saved Texas taxpayers more than $6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Richards reformed the Texas prison system, establishing a substance abuse program for inmates, reducing the number of violent offenders released, and increasing prison space to deal with a growing prison population (from less than 60,000 in 1992 to more than 80,000 in 1994). She backed proposals to reduce the sale of semi-automatic firearms and "cop-killer" bullets in the state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Texas Lottery was also instituted during her governorship--advocated as a means of supplementing school finances; Ann Richards purchased the first lotto ticket on May 29, 1992. However, most of the income from the lottery went into the state's general fund rather than specifically to education, until 1997, when all lottery net revenue was redirected to the state's Foundation School Fund, which supports public education. School finance remained one of the key issues of her governorship and  of those succeeding hers; the famous Robin Hood plan was launched in the 1992-1993 biennium which attempted to make school funding more equitable across school districts. Richards also sought to decentralize control over education policy to districts and individual campuses; she instituted "site-based management" to this end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March 2006, Governor Richards announced that she had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and will be seeking treatment at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The disease has a five-year survival rate of 25 percent. Despite the statistics, Governor Richards vowed to beat her illness and battled valiantly until the very last day, when she finished her journey on earth and ascended to the heavens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of us who knew and loved Ann Richards will ever forget her or the way she brightened the lives of all the people she served. She was one in a million and she will be deeply missed. She will never be replaced. She was an American original. She was my friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="42">H. Res. 42</bill>, recognizing Ann. Richards extraordinary contributions to Texas and American public life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann Richards and I worked together when I served in Texas State Senate in 1991 and 1992 before I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993. At that time, she was serving as the Governor of Texas. During our tenure in the state house we worked together to support stronger environmental laws for our district and Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Richards was a teacher who started out in politics as a volunteer on the campaigns of Sarah Weddington, Henry B. Gonzalez, and Ralph Yarborough. She began her own political career in 1976 when she was elected to serve as a County Commissioner in Travis County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years later in 1982, she was elected Texas State Treasurer and served two terms. Ann made history by becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in fifty years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, Ann ran for governor and promised to increase the role of minorities and women in state government as part of her plan for a "New Texas." When Governor Richards was elected she made it a priority as governor to appoint more women and minorities to state boards and commissions and followed through on her promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her tenure, Governor Richards had many accomplishments including revitalizing the Texas economy, reforming the prison system, and instituting the state lottery. Once she left public office, Ann continued to be an inspiration to us all when she bravely battled osteoporosis and esophageal cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ann wasn't only the governor of one of the greatest states in America, but she was one of America's greatest governors in terms of her personality, sense of humor, and trailblazing accomplishments. Governor Richards was the First Lady of Texas politics and her extraordinary accomplishments make her not only a Texas hero, but also an American hero.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="42">H. Res. 42</bill> offered by my colleague and neighbor Congressman SOLOMON ORTIZ. Governor Ann Richards was a woman of incomparable spirit, wit, intelligence, and heart. She was a trailblazer who opened the world of public service and politics to women and minorities in her beloved home state of Texas, as well as throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember her most for her commitment to my constituents in South Texas. In 1993, Governor Richards signed the bill to create South Texas Community College, now South Texas College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without Governor Richards' direct insight and involvement in granting us a three year waiver in not requiring a taxing district, the creation of the school simply would not have been possible. Today, the college, with 17,000 students, is responsible for contributing to our local economy through workforce and job training programs, has directly contributed to the drop in the region's unemployment rate, and extends education opportunities for so many students. She also helped to streamline the  state's government and helped create programs and opportunities for Texas' economy to flourish at a time when the country's languished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is incumbent upon all of US to continue the legacy started by Ann Richards decades ago. We need to lend voice to the disadvantaged and disenfranchised; give americans a leg-up, not a hand-out; and, create opportunities for all to participate in their government. It is a legacy she was proud of, and one I will not forget. She will be missed by so many, and especially by me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation honoring such a great lady.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400118" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Ann Richards was a true Texas treasure. We shall miss her  dearly, but her spirit will live on to inspire generations to come. She made a positive difference for Texas and for our nation. In my book she represented the very best of political leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an era when the good ol' boy system denied opportunities to women and racial minorities, she broke down barriers to ensure that public service would be open to all. In an era when self-important politicians too often took themselves too seriously, she used good humor to keep our feet on the ground, even as we were rolling in laughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Governor of the state she loved, her accomplishments were many, whether in improving education or health care or job opportunities. Yet, like the best of political leaders, her greatest legacy will be having inspired others to be their best, to reach for their dreams, and to make life better for our neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no doubt that after all of us in this House are gone and forgotten, the legacy of Ann Richards will be carrying on through the countless lives of those who were inspired to public service by the touch of this great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, it was an honor for me to know Ann Richards, especially since she graduated from Baylor University and her parents lived in my hometown of Waco, Texas. It was back in Waco, often outside the limelight of the press, that I admired Ann Richards' deep love and respect for average working families. She understood that they are the backbone of our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us honored to call Ann Richards our friend, and those of us whose lives were touched by her commitment to equality and public service know that there will never be anyone quite like her. That is why we miss her so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somehow, I just have to believe that Governor Richards wanted to witness from a heavenly seat the swearing in of Speaker PELOSI as the first woman Speaker of the U.S. House. Or, perhaps the Good Lord just wanted Ann Richards to be by His side when that history was made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Either way, I have no doubt that heaven is a little funnier place with Ann Richards there and that our nation is a better place because of her time here on earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the Richards family, I want to express a heart-felt "thank you" for sharing your special loved one with all of us for so many years. Our memories of her will inspire us to be better, to do more for years to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="42">H. Res. 42</bill>. Anne Richards's devotion to the state of Texas deserves our highest honor and commendation. Her work to promote the rights of women in politics, devotion to equality and her never-failing drive to better the lives of her constituents made her an iconic figure in Texas politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Richards began her political career in the 1970's fighting for equality. As an advocate for female politicians, she managed Sarah Weddington's successful bid to become a member of the Texas State House of Representatives. She then joined State Representative Weddington as a legislative assistant in 1974, during this time she also participated in Wilhelmina Delco's campaign to become the first African-American to represent Austin in the state legislature. Not content to rest there, she  provided training sessions across the state for female candidates and managers. She would continue this fight for equality for the next 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982 she was elected to the post of state treasurer becoming the first woman elected to state-wide office in more than 50 years. She devoted herself to the modernization of the state treasury and to earning the greatest possible interest for the state of Texas. According to one estimate, the treasury earned 1.8 billion dollars under her leadership, representing a huge improvement over her predecessor. During her tenure she displayed the incredible wit that made her such a powerful public speaker  and one of the most popular figures in Texas politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After two terms as state treasurer she was elected Governor of the state of Texas in 1990. What she accomplished in her four years as Governor was nothing short of amazing. Among the achievements for which we are honoring her here today, she revitalized the Texan economy, achieving growth during a period of national economic decline. She revamped the Texas prison system to improve rehabilitation for inmates and to better protect the citizens of Texas by establishing a substance abuse program  for inmates, working to expand capacity and reduce prison overpopulation, and reducing the number of violent offenders released. The Texas Lottery was also instituted during Governor Richards' time in office as a means to supplement school financing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education and school financing were focal points of her Governorship. She worked tirelessly to make school funding more equitable across districts and championed "sitebased management" programs to decentralize school administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of her nearly 3,000 government appointments, 46 percent were female, 15 percent were black, 20 percent were Hispanic and 2 percent were Asian American. I rise today to honor her commitment to diversity, her battle for equality, and her lifetime of service to the state of Texas and the United States of America.</paragraph>
