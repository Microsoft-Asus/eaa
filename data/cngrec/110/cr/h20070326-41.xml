    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to trade policies that are unfair to American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must insist on a new model for trade that makes American workers the top priority. Trade agreements must also take into account protections for the environment and ensure access to life-saving medicines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing trade agreements that take these priorities into account will be difficult, but we must not rush into obligations which will ultimately harm our own interests, and we must reject the false choice between expanding our trade opportunities and fairness to U.S. workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is simply wrong to follow the old model that we know hurts the livelihoods of so many of our constituents. That is why Democrats are pushing for new priorities in the trade deals that the administration is negotiating with Colombia, Peru, Panama, South Korea and other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must continue to press the administration to change its trade policies and provide specific, constructive suggestions to advance the goals of our workers and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Bush administration doesn't act as though it believes that Congress should have a real say in trade negotiations. One example, though it is certainly not the only one, is the matter of allowing access to life-saving medications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has passed legislation directing the administration to respect  the Doha Declaration, an agreement that allows countries flexibility under WTO rules to provide for public health. Although the administration signed the Doha Declaration, USTR has completely ignored Congress' directive to respect it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every trade pact negotiated since 2002 has contained stringent intellectual property rules sought by the major drug companies. By keeping medicine prices high, these rules increase industry profits but restrict access to needed medicines for citizens in developing countries. Even in current free trade negotiations, USTR continues to ignore the will of Congress to respect the Doha Declaration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why a new framework for trade must include a stronger role for Congress. The current model of nonbinding negotiating objectives permits the President to ignore the wishes of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise that the administration has favored large corporate interests at the expense of American workers, the environment and global health. But it is wrong. However, our new majority in Congress will respond to workers who have been hurt by previous trade agreements. After all, trade agreements have affected my home State of Maine's manufacturing, farming and service sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon Congress may be asked to consider renewing fast track authority. I voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which granted fast track authority to the President. I urge my colleagues to reject renewal of fast track in its current form. It is vital that Congress continue to press for change, firmly and constructively.</paragraph>
