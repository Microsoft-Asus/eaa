  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 793 provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007, under a structured rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule makes in order three amendments that are included in the Rules Committee report. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 and passage of this rule. By passing this bipartisan legislation today, the House of Representatives will take another step, important step, towards equality for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 230-year-plus history of our great Nation, the march towards equality under the law for all of our citizens has sometimes been slow, but it has been steady. Over time, Congress has outlawed discrimination in the workplace, based upon a person's race, gender, age, national origin, religion and disability, because when it comes to employment and hiring and firing and compensation and promotion, these decisions are rightly based upon a person's qualifications and job performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Sometimes the fight for equality has been slow in coming indeed. This legislation that outlaws job discrimination based upon sexual orientation that the Congress will pass today was first introduced over 30 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is long past time to ensure that no one in our country can be discriminated against and fired from their job based upon who they are, whether it is their race, their color, whether they are a man or a woman, or whether they are gay. Private companies across America know this and are way ahead of the politicians here in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our neighbors back home would be shocked to learn that millions of Americans can be fired from their jobs or refused work or paid less and otherwise subjected to employment discrimination without regard for the quality of their work and without any recourse under Federal law. While many States, cities, and counties across the country have outlawed job discrimination on their own, many States and localities have not. I am proud that the cities of Tampa and St. Petersburg that I represent  have outlawed job discrimination against gays and lesbians, but our counties have not, unfortunately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act protects all Americans, no matter where they live, by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, and refuse to promote employees based upon a person's sexual orientation. See, in America no person should have to worry about the security of their job because of their sexual orientation. Our country bases employment evaluation on hard work and on a job well done. Making employment decisions on anything else is unacceptable. In fact, 90 percent of Fortune 500  companies in the United States have adopted policies similar to the legislation that the Congress will pass today. And a broad coalition of businesses and community organizations strongly support this landmark civil rights legislation, including the Human Rights Campaign; the Anti-Defamation League; Central Conference of American Rabbis; the National Education Association; the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and, I am proud to say, the NAACP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that this Congress will stand up for equality for all Americans and stand behind our values and understanding that we do not discriminate against our neighbors for any reason, and we should be able to live comfortably with the knowledge that our neighbors will not discriminate against us. The passage of this legislation will remove a legitimate fear that exists among us that we may lose our job and be unable to provide for our families when someone decides to exercise intolerance and  prejudices against us and our neighbors in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to extraordinary leaders in Congressman BARNEY FRANK, Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN, Chairman George Miller, Congressman ROB ANDREWS, Congressman CHRIS SHAYS, Congresswoman DEBORAH PRYCE, and so many others that will stand up for Americans here in this body today and pass this law, I thank them for their leadership and their commitment to equality for all Americans. And I agree with them that passing this historic nondiscrimination act will bring  our Nation closer to our goal and our promise of equality for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Federal law bans job discrimination based on race, color, national origin, or gender. In addition to Federal law, 11 States have passed laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, while another eight States bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would extend Federal employment discrimination protections to employees on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose discrimination in the workplace, and I believe that skills and job performance are essential for determining whether employees are hired, promoted, or dismissed. However, I do not think it is the place of the Federal Government to legislate how each and every workplace operates. As a former small business owner, I know that what brings success  to one company does not necessarily bring success to another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, a number of States have enacted State laws in this area. That is their right as States. Many small businesses and large corporations have chosen to adopt their own policies. That is appropriate as well, Mr. Speaker. This bill as written, though, raises a number of concerns, including that it would expand Federal law into a realm where perception, Mr. Speaker, would be a measure under discrimination law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, my colleagues on the Rules Committee and Members testifying before the committee pointed out that debate on the bill, at least in committee, had been productive and a respectful one. Mr. Speaker, I am truly disappointed that moments later, the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee chose to report out a rule that denies the House and the American people the opportunity for a full and fair debate by prohibiting 99 percent of the Members of the U.S. House the opportunity to come to the  floor and offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 2 weeks, Democrat leaders have had the opportunity to amend, alter, and change this bill. This editing and rewriting has been done behind closed doors and is contained within the Miller-Stupak amendment. Democrat leaders have acted to deny a public debate and to deny Republicans the opportunity to offer an amendment similar in scope to the Miller-Stupak amendment. This is not an open and honest way to run the House, and it is not what Democrat leaders promised the American people  only a year ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule only makes three amendments in order, Mr. Speaker, but buried in this rule there is a special provision, a special provision, that allows amendment No. 3 in the report of the Committee on Rules to be withdrawn by its proponent before the question of adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what does this mean? It means that the Rules Committee decided to make three amendments in order but denies the House a vote on one of those amendments. I just have to wonder why the Democrat Rules Committee is denying a vote on this amendment. My friend from Florida was up there, and I would yield to the gentlewoman from Florida if she can tell me why this provision is in the bill to deny the House a vote on amendment No. 3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield to my friend if she would explain this for me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do wish Ms. Baldwin would allow a vote on the amendment. I strongly support the amendment, as many of those in the Congress do. But this was her request, and this is the way the rule has been structured.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for giving me that option. I can't remember how many times I have been in the Rules Committee talking about and asking Members who come forward with potential amendments what their choice would be, would they like to have an open rule or would they like to have a closed rule. And every time I hear, at least from the members of the Rules Committee, that the Rules Committee will decide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it sounds in this particular case that one Member decided that she didn't want a vote on it, so we deny everybody in the House an opportunity. The gentlewoman said that she would like to be able to vote on this. I will give her the opportunity to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have to say I have served on this Rules Committee for a decade, and I cannot recall one instance when Republicans were in control that a rule allowed a Member to bypass House Rules and withdraw an amendment. I believe it is wrong for a substantive legislative issue to be raised on the floor only to deny Americans, through their representatives, a voice on that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear about what is happening here. And that is that the rules of the House are being altered to block the House from voting on this amendment. It is clear and simple. We were elected to represent our constituents by casting a vote and votes, and today Democrat leaders are denying us a vote. I am extremely concerned with this unprecedented rule and I have an amendment, and I hope the gentlewoman will support me. My amendment would, in section 1 of the resolution, strike the sentence  which begins, "Amendment No. 3 in the report of the Committee on Rules."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be amended to reflect the change as offered in my amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>I object.</paragraph>

  <chair> Does the gentlewoman from Florida yield for that request?</chair>

    <paragraph>No, I do not.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from Florida does not yield for that purpose.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to make this clear, Mr. Speaker. I am asking unanimous consent to have the amendment that I described be considered. Now, if I have to engage the gentlewoman for that determination, I would be happy to do so, but I am asking unanimous consent that that be done. I am just asking for a ruling on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman has yielded for the purpose of debate only. She did not yield for the purpose of propounding a unanimous consent request.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, the way I understand your ruling, then, is that I hear no objection; so, therefore, my amendment should be made in order, and I would like to move the proper procedure as I don't hear any objection.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from Florida did not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>So there has been an objection?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> No. The Chair cannot entertain the gentleman's request unless the manager of the resolution has yielded for that purpose.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentlewoman yield? Did she reserve the right to object and would she yield at least to explain why she objected?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> All time was yielded for debate only. The gentleman is not entitled to propound that form of unanimous-consent request unless yielded to for that purpose.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I attempt to amend this, what procedure would I go through in order to try to amend this rule?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> If the previous question were defeated, an amendment could be offered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry. Then the only means I have is through the previous question and not to ask unanimous consent?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Or if the gentlewoman yields for that purpose.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Will the gentlewoman yield so I can ask unanimous consent to amend the rule?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, but I will not yield at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman has not yielded.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if that's the case, then, Mr. Speaker, I accept the ruling, and I wish I had a more full description of why there is a problem not at least allowing potentially a vote on amendment No. 3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no other choice but to ask my colleagues, then, later on today to defeat the previous question so that I can amend the rule by striking the language that I described that allows the proponent of amendment No. 3 to withdraw their amendment before a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So, just let me be clear. When I offered this motion, by voting "no" on the previous question, Members will, therefore, be allowed to show their support or opposition on amendment No. 3, which would expand the bill's protections to persons discriminated against based on gender identity. This is defined in the amendment as "gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms or other characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to an individual's designated sex at birth." Now, Members  who choose to say "yes," then, on the previous question would, therefore, be showing their support for denying Members of this House an opportunity to vote on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge, and I will talk about this later, but I urge my colleagues to vote "no" when I offer that motion on the previous question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 1/2  minutes to a Member of Congress that continuously and forcefully speaks out for equality for all Americans, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank the gentlelady for yielding, for her leadership, and for her fairness and her diligent work on the Rules Committee. Also, I want to thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK and Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First let me say that I was on the floor two nights ago, and Members of Congress so eloquently reminded us that this is National Bible Week. So as one who believes in the Scriptures, as a Christian, and as one who embraces what everything, Democrats and Republicans, were talking about the other night as it relates to love thy neighbor as thyself, we are responsible for the least of these. I know for a fact, like all of you know for a fact, that discrimination against anyone, and I mean anyone,  is morally and ethically wrong, and it goes against the teachings of all of our great religions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Baldwin amendment, which recognizes that transgendered Americans should have all of the protections and the rights of any person in America, should be included in this bill. It should include the Baldwin amendment. Because if we believe in who we are as a country, and if we believe that discrimination is wrong against anyone, then how in the world can we leave out a significant number of Americans in this bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, if it becomes law, transgendered Americans will still face discrimination in the workplace. And we must not let up until we ban discrimination against everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say, in closing, that gender identity should not be allowed in terms of discrimination in terms of the laws that we pass. We should not allow discrimination against anyone based on gender identity, based on sexual orientation, based on race, religion, age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is America. This is America. And I think that the Baldwin amendment would take us one step closer to being the country and the America that we all believe in and that we all love.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You were speaking, if I heard you correctly, on the Baldwin amendment. Now, the way the rule is structured, there is potential for not a vote on that amendment. I'm going to offer a motion on the previous question to allow that to be voted. Now, if I understood what the gentlelady was saying in her remarks, she would like the opportunity to debate that and presumably vote on that. So I would hope that the gentlelady would join me in voting "no" on the previous question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlelady.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, a gentleman who has devoted a large part of his career to fighting discrimination and prejudice in the workplace, BARNEY FRANK from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am impressed by the sincerity of the gentleman from Washington's advocacy on people who are transgender, and I hope that as we contemplate this strategy today people will fully examine that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret the fact that there do not appear to be the votes in this House to include people who are transgender. And I am struck by the eagerness, frankly, of some people to use that group as a weapon with which to defeat the whole bill because these are people who are opposed not only to the inclusion of people who are transgender, but who have historically been opposed to including any protection for people at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the gentleman was listening to my remarks, I know he came in, unfortunately, after I had started making my remarks, but my whole point was suggesting that we have a process here where we can dispose of the measure, either for or against. That's all I'm saying.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I take back my time. That's all the gentleman said, but the effect would be to try to undermine the bill. When people who are opposed to the basic bill and opposed to the amendment lament the chance not to vote on an amendment which would undermine the bill, people should understand where we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I filed the bill that included people who are transgender. And earlier this year, I was very proud when this House passed a hate crimes bill which explicitly included people who are transgender. My recollection is the gentleman from Washington voted against that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in the following situation in this country: We have had prejudices of various sorts. Sadly, prejudice increases as difference increases. We have made progress in, I believe, disputing the prejudice against people, like myself, who are gay. We have not, lamentably, made as much progress in people who are transgender. I agree that the argument is there for including everyone. I agree that there was an argument for including legal immigrants in the SCHIP bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question we have is this: If we do not have the votes to go forward with as much as we would like to do, do we then abandon any effort? And do we allow those who are opposed to any progress at all in the anti-discrimination fight in this area to use a particular group as a way to prevent progress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I've been voting on anti-discrimination measures for 35 years when I first joined the legislature, and I have voted repeatedly to extend the protection to groups of which I am not a member, based on ethnicity, based on race, based on disability, based on age. I am now a beneficiary of the age one, but I wasn't when I voted for it. And I wish we had the votes in this House to ban discrimination of all sorts. I also wish that I had as much energy today as I did when I voted to ban  AIDS discrimination when it wasn't eligible. I wish I could eat more and not gain weight. I wish a lot of things. But I will not act on my wishes irresponsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will go forward today and do as much as we can. I believe that if we are able to muster the votes to tell millions of Americans who are gay and lesbian that they are not bad people, that it is not legitimate to fire them simply because of who they are, the message we send to those people, the message we send to high school students who go to school each day fearing the kind of torment that they will confront, that that will be the most significant advance we have made in fighting prejudice  since the Americans with Disabilities Act. I wish we could do more. And if we are able to do this, I will continue my efforts to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad to see more recruits now to the effort to protect people who are  transgender. I wish they were there when many of us were fighting many years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will make this prediction, that if we go forward today and adopt legislation that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation but does not ban discrimination based on gender identity, some of us will continue to fight to protect people based on gender identity, and many of those seeking to use that issue today will be our opponents as we go forward trying to do it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, and the rule that we have before us today. Primarily, I'm opposed to the measure's unclear wording that could easily lead to wide-ranging and serious consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would prohibit discrimination, which is a good thing, on extremely hard-to-define measures such as an individual's perceived characteristics. I think it's the perception and the "perceived" language in here that is very troubling to me as a former small business owner with up to 15 employees. It would be impossible for employers to operate a business while having to worry about being accused of mistreating someone based on the employee's "perceived characteristics." This ill-conceived,  vague language is nothing more than a golden ticket for America's trial lawyers. This loose wording is also an invitation for accusations by disgruntled employees who want to take advantage of a poorly constructed law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all of my colleagues, I believe congressional policies should strive to promote a tolerant society. I believe many Members, including myself, would vote for it without the "perception" language in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Massachusetts spoke before very eloquently, as he always does, and he said, our laws should not say that gay people are bad people. That's not what this bill says, nor has any bill that has come before us ever said that. When people that I come in contact with begin to disparage individuals who may be gay, I point out to them that, you know, you don't know whether your Aunt Jen, our son Bill, your grandson Paul or your granddaughter may be gay, so it's inappropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, it's inappropriate to make disparaging comments about anyone who is gay because people really don't know the people around them, whether they are or whether they're not, and it's really none of their business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>However, when that quest for intolerance in this bill leads us to costly and irresponsible ends, I think we must rethink the legislation. At a time when America faces so many challenges, the last thing Congress needs to be doing is finding a way to hand trial lawyers an avalanche of litigation to cash in on. I urge my colleagues to oppose this poorly drafted legislation. Let's go back to the drafting board with this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400289" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am committed to the passage of an ENDA that protects lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. I have been a lead sponsor for proposals like ENDA every year since I became a member of the New York State Assembly 30 years ago. I am a proud original cosponsor of the original ENDA bill that would protect the entire LGBT community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that civil rights are best advanced by bringing forward a bill that adequately protects all members of the LGBT community. While this may be risky, it is not reason to accept defeat before the fact and to leave behind members of the community who desperately need protection against employment discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen in many States, the failure to include transgender people in civil rights legislation from the beginning makes it more difficult to extend protections later. My own State of New York, which enacted employment protections for lesbians and gays, has yet to extend these protections to the transgender community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has yet even to introduce its version of ENDA. Indeed, even if Congress were to adopt a noninclusive ENDA, the President has already pledged to veto this legislation. So it is not a question, as the gentleman from Massachusetts said, of now choosing to protect a great number of people and leaving behind a smaller number of people as the price of so doing because we cannot pass this legislation into law and protect anyone this year, unfortunately. We must look to the future when we  have a President who will support equality. I believe it is important we take a principled stand now and speak with a strong and united voice for equal rights for all Americans, whether they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in order to maximize the chance that when we can enact an ENDA bill into law, it will be an inclusive bill that protects everyone's rights. And we must better educate lawmakers and the public about the issues of gender identity and expression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I may disagree with some of my colleagues on strategy, I assure you that we are united in support of the ultimate goal, protection from employment discrimination for the entire LGBT community. No one should underestimate the strength of that common commitment or our dedication to seeing it realized. Transgender Americans, because of a lack of familiarity and understanding, are more likely to face employment discrimination and, therefore, more in need of protection from irrational discrimination  that an inclusive ENDA would afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And removing gender identity from ENDA may also leave lesbian and gay employees vulnerable to discrimination for failing to conform to gender stereotypes. In other words, some employers and courts may take an overly restrictive view that an exclusive ENDA fails to protect lesbians who appear "too masculine" or gay men who appear "too effeminate." That is not our intent, nor do we believe it is an accurate reading of the bill, but congressional intent does not always carry the day. Splitting  sexual orientation and gender identity disserves the entire LGBT community and invites the kind of legal mischief that has undermined other civil rights laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fundamental issue is this: There are still too many places where it is entirely legal to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender employees. We must bring an end to this unfair, unacceptable and un-American situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the House considers ENDA today, I will support the amendment introduced by Congresswoman Baldwin to restore the protections from discrimination based on gender identity. Should that amendment fail, I will not be able to vote for the underlying bill because it fails to uphold adequately the American values of fairness, equality and inclusion, but I will continue to fight for a proper ENDA bill that includes all the people who need its help.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 7 minutes to a classmate of mine, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400385" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank my distinguished friend from Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than comment generally on the bill here, I am going to focus on the rule. I will talk later on the bill itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a senior member of the Education Committee, we went through this debate in committee, and I find it reprehensible that the process we have been following increasingly in this House is to shut off debate, that ironically in a bill that is supposedly expanding rights, we have another narrowly drawn rule that deprived me of offering several amendments that I offered in committee, has a gerrymandered rule for another amendment that is unique in history, has several others put in in the Rules Committee  that are very unclear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me go through a number of these different amendments. I offered an amendment in committee that was unanimously opposed by the Democrats in committee to eliminate the word "perceived." This is a legal nightmare. There is no other law. There is talk about how ADA has some things vaguely familiar. But it does not say "perceived." How in the world are you going to define "perceived"? As anybody who has any friends who have worked with and been acquainted with people who have a homosexual  lifestyle, there are all types. This is open-ended. There is no list here of what is perceived to be homosexual. How is an employer supposed to figure out whether it is perceived? Does that mean if he is a Christian and has made statements, somebody can file a suit because they perceived they were discriminated, not based</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also had an amendment that would have provided some protection for Christians who have strong views in the workplace and will insert into the Record at this point a number of cases. An AT&amp;T employee was fired because he wouldn't sign a statement that contradicted his religious beliefs on accepting homosexual behavior. A man was fired at Red Cross for not participating in Gay and Lesbian Pride Month and forcing him to observe that. Others have been fired for other reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is not whether you can harass somebody in the workplace. That is already illegal. If you mock somebody, that is already illegal. If you commit a hate crime, that is already illegal. The question is, can you as a Christian express your views and not be persecuted? That, yes, in a sense it is at least a plurality of Americans profess Christianity, a smaller percent conservative Christianity, but we are moving so far as to restrict the rights in the workplace of Christians' even ability  to hold or say anything about their views. People can't even have Bible studies in some places it has been ruled because that would be offensive to homosexuals in the workplace based on this law in some cities and have been upheld in the court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, moving past the two amendments that were unanimously defeated in committee and then we weren't allowed to debate as a whole House, we have an amendment that was added in response to another amendment from Pete Hoekstra in committee that would have exempted Christian colleges. It was unanimously defeated by the Democrats in committee. Then suddenly in the Rules Committee we have it added with a religious exemption. The problem with the religious exemption, and here I would like to  put into the Record a number of cases that show the problem with this. Loyola University was deprived of a religious exemption because even though it was founded by Jesuits, its charter requires its president to be a Jesuit and more than one-third of their trustees, they were denied because they didn't meet one of those criteria. A Friends School, a Quaker school, was denied a religious exemption because it had to have multiple proof that everybody there was Quaker and was following every rule. A private religious school was denied for similar type things. A business that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, they will be forced to hire homosexuals regardless of the personal views of Christian bookstores. This is going to happen in various independent organizations that are quasi-part of the church. Sometimes the church will operate a for-profit entity, that runs as a for-profit entity, that would not be predominantly for a religious purpose, but the proceeds go to the church, therefore, they will implement their church beliefs in it, even though it is a for-profit entity. None of  that is exempted under this. We didn't even get a chance to debate this amendment. It just came in in the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we move to another amendment that suddenly appeared, or I guess we will be debating here on marriage. Somehow in response to debate in committee, they are saying that this won't affect the Defense of Marriage Act. This is another lawsuit amendment because that is directly contrary to the fundamental part of the bill. My amendment tries to address part of this, but quite frankly, it is a legal quagmire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we come to amendments that are allowed. We have had some debate on this gender equity for transgender and transvestite. Now, the challenge here is not whether you favor it or are against it. I heard my friend from New York say he was going to vote for it. He can't vote for it. We are not allowed to vote for it. We have been banned from having a debate. What happened to the day when we have a debate, you win or lose? To come in unprecedented, I have never heard, as a staffer or a Member,  a rule coming in prohibiting in the rule a vote. This is an in-your-face tactic as part of this bill to not let us debate the religious underpinnings and the religious stuff, not debate "perceived," not debate protections for people who are individuals, not have a vote on transgender, and it's 5 minutes on each side to even debate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an abominable rule. It is a precedent-setting, terrible, terrible rule. I urge people to support my colleague Mr. Hastings' motion on the previous question and to vote against that so we can have some amendments to this rule and then vote against this abominable rule because it sets precedents we will regret for a long, long time no matter which party is in the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Examples of Discrimination Against Religious Employees</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christian employees who read Bibles during "diversity training" reprimanded and spend four years in lawsuits to obtain reversal. The ACLJ filed suit in April 1998 against the Minnesota Department of Corrections on behalf of Thomas Altman and Ken Yackly to force their employer to rescind the reprimands they received in 1997 after they silently read their Bibles at a state-mandated training session called "Gays and Lesbians in the Workplace." The employees contended that the training session  was little more than a state-sponsored indoctrination aimed at changing their religious beliefs about homosexuality. Four years later, and several appeals later, the employees were finally vindicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AT&amp;T employee in Denver fired for refusing to sign company-required pledge to recognize, respect and value sexual orientation  differences within the company. In January 2001, an employee of AT&amp;T was required to sign a new AT&amp;T Broadband Employee Handbook with policies that conflicted with his religious beliefs by condoning the homosexual lifestyle. After notifying his supervisor that based on his religious belief he could not sign the certificate of  understanding, he was fired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christian firefighter suspended for handing out tract entitled "The truth about homosexuality." Madison, Wis., firefighter Ron Greer nearly lost his job for giving his colleagues a tract entitled, "The truth about homosexuality." He was suspended and ordered to attend diversity training for violating the city's anti-discrimination code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hospice worker fired by gay supervisor for expressing Christian beliefs about homosexuality. Debra Kelly, a former hospice worker in Philadelphia, was fired for expressing her Christian beliefs about homosexuality. Her supervisor, a supporter of ACT-UP, a militant homosexual group, said Kelly was intolerant and unsuited for her position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At Hewlett Packard's plant in Boise, Idaho, an employee with a 21-year record of meeting or exceeding expectations was fired for refusing to remove Bible verses about homosexuality from his cubicle. The employee allegedly posted the Bible verses in response to a poster near his cubicle that he perceived to be promoting GLBT relationships. HP openly admitted that its reasoning for firing the employee was "his overt opposition to HP's Diversity Advertising Campaign."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Man fired by American Red Cross for not celebrating homosexuality Michael Hartman was employed by the Red Cross in San Diego. The company sent a mass e-mail to all employees in 2005 promoting "Gay and Lesbian Pride Month," urging them to "observe" the celebration. Hartman, a Christian, communicated his religious objections to his supervisors and was promptly called in and told his communication was "inappropriate." Hartmann was fired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oakland city employees posting a flier on a company bulletin board forced to remove flier and threatened with discipline. Oakland, Calif., city employees Regina Rederlord and Robin Christy formed a group called the "Good News Employee Association" and posted a flier on a company bulletin board advertising a "forum for people of faith to express their views on contemporary issues of the day, with respect for the natural family, marriage and family values." After a lesbian employee complained  of being offended by the flier, the city removed the flier and threatened the two women with adverse employment action for placing the fliers "in public view which contained statements of a homophobic nature and were determined to promote sexual orientation based harassment." A federal court upheld the city's action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Portland, Maine, city officials canceled a $60,000 grant for a Salvation Army meals-on-wheels program for senior citizens. Why? As a Christian denomination, the Salvation Army won't provide marital benefits to homosexual employees, thus running afoul of the city's "sexual orientation" law. When the Portland's "sexual orientation" ordinance was introduced, proponents argued, as they do often today, that it would merely ensure that "people won't be fired for being "gay."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A District of Columbia human rights commission ordered Georgetown University, a Catholic college, to violate church doctrine and sponsor a pro-homosexual group on campus. A court agreed, saying the District's "sexual orientation" law overrode the school's religious freedom. It didn't matter that neither "sexual orientation" nor sodomy are protected in the Constitution or that religion is specifically protected. In the hands of the judges, "sexual orientation" takes on a life of its own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003 Atlanta Human Rights Commission ordered a local golf club to extend spousal rights to gay member partners, Thankfully officials intervened, and the Georgia legislature promptly passed a law exempting private clubs from local anti-discrimination obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, 2001, The District of Columbia's Commission on Human Rights fined the Scouts $100,000 and ordered them to reinstate two openly homosexual leaders. That decision was overturned in court, but the Scouts paid heavy legal fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Arlington, Virginia, a video duplicator had been ordered by the Arlington County Human Rights Commission to produce video material for a lesbian activist or pay for someone else to duplicate the videos. The videos Vincenz wanted duplicated were two documentaries entitled: "Gay and Proud" and "Second Largest Minority". Tim Bono, argued that he could not, in good conscience (him being a Christian), produce material that promoted homosexual activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 the 9th Circuit Court in California ruled last year (06) that members of a Christian employees group for the city of Oakland could not use words like "marriage," "natural family," or "family values" in email correspondence or on posters in city offices where a wide variety of groups are allowed to post. The 9th circuit panel decided that such words were akin to hate speech because they made homosexual city employees uncomfortable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cases Where Courts Wrongly Denied Religious Exemption</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fike v. United Methodist Children's Home of Virginia, Inc., 547 F. Supp. 286 (E.D. Va. 1982)--an orphanage founded by the Methodist Church, trustees required to be Methodists, sought to teach Christian doctrine and belief to the children. New President sought to take group in more secular direction and was fired, despite the entity's desire to recapture its original founding mission to be a thoroughly Christian (and Methodist) charity service. Court held it had become too secular  in the interim, and denied religious exemption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pime v. Loyola University--Catholic University denied the general religious exemption under Title VII despite the fact that it was founded by Jesuits, its charter requires its President to be a Jesuit, and more than one third of its trustees are Jesuits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doe v. Abington Friends School, 480 F. 3d 252 (3d Cir. 2007)--religious school run and funded entirely by Quakers not entitled to early dismissal on religious exemption grounds in an Americans with Disabilities Act case, but was required to submit to extensive discovery demands of the plaintiff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EEOC v. Kamehameha School/Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 439 (1993)--private Protestant religious school denied Title VII religious exemption even though it had numerous religious characteristics and activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EEOC v. Townley Eng'g &amp; Mfg. Co., 859 F. 2d 610 (9th Cir. 1988)--no exemption for manufacturing company whose owner had a clearly religious world view and wanted it to permeate the workplace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act is sensitive to religious organizations and our fundamental religious beliefs and tenets, and it includes a very broad religious exemption. In fact, we are going to debate later on the Miller amendment that, if adopted, would make clear that ENDA exempts the same group of religious organizations that are currently exempt from prohibition on religious discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we know not everyone, not every employer will agree that gay people should be protected from employment discrimination. But for the betterment and advancement of our society as a whole, ENDA would overrule that judgment so that Americans are treated fairly and equally. But nothing in ENDA or in any civil rights law that has come before us in the history of this country affects the ability, the God-given right of a person to hold contrary beliefs based on religion or otherwise.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is one of those moments where the House gets to demonstrate the degree to which we are truly committed to the unfolding of 14th amendment rights to due process and equal protection of the law. We get a chance to determine that today. I believe that people who happen to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender are entitled to the full and equal protection of employment laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The principles behind the original draft of ENDA sought to embrace the fullness of a community which has experienced significant undermining of rights in the workplace. None of us can know, unless we have walked in somebody's shoes, but let's imagine for a moment that someone who presents himself or herself as being of another sex or gender, imagine what they must go through in their daily lives. And imagine we who take an oath to defend the Constitution would somehow separate the people from  the claims of justice and from the claims of constitutional protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We all love this country. We all love being Americans. But to be an American means really standing for those constitutional principles and really understanding that life, liberty and pursuit of happiness are something that everyone should have access to and that everyone should have equal protection of the law and due process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak against <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, and the restrictive, undemocratic and authoritarian rule that the majority party has put before us today. Mr. Speaker, I realize that I am one of the newest Members of the House of Representatives, having been sworn in just 3 months ago, but I recognize a totalitarian regime when I see one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my short tenure here, the Democratic majority has made a mockery of the democratic process, and today's rule is a perfect example. For you good folks at home, this is what is happening in a nutshell. The Democrats sprung this bill on us that will grant special employment privileges and a protected minority status to anyone who defines themselves by their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that's not all. They gave us less than 24 hours, less than 24 hours' notice that this bill will be on the floor, because when the schedule for this week was sent last Friday, it made no mention of this discriminatory bill. And for good reason. They don't want the American people to realize they are undermining America's religious liberties in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they didn't stop there. Then the Democratic majority decided to rig the process to block Republican amendments to even slightly improve this terrible and unfortunate bill. An authoritarian regime, right here in the House of Representatives, otherwise known as the Democratic majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote against this rule, and I urge my colleagues to do so.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the underlying bill and the Baldwin amendment. ENDA will offer real protections to tens of millions of Americans now. Right now, far too many workers go to work every day fearing that they could be fired on the spot, no questions asked, if their employer discovered their sexual orientation. This year, it is legal in 30 States to fire someone simply because he or she is gay, lesbian or bisexual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hardworking, tax-paying Americans shouldn't be forced into the shadows, and they should not have to live with the constant, legitimate fear that they could lose their jobs. That is why I strongly support providing protection from discrimination to transgender Americans, and I will not rest until their right to live their lives free of fear, discrimination, and intolerance is the law of this land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know from my years on the city council where we worked to pass similar legislation and my years in the women's movement that we need to make history now and pass the underlying bill and protect people here in America now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one should be discriminated against because of his or her sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. And this bill will also lay the groundwork to provide sorely needed protections in the future to countless more Americans who need and deserve them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic advance for civil rights has been more than three decades in the making--and it has not come easy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Bella Abzug first introduced a sexual orientation civil rights bill in 1974, she was able to enlist only one cosponsor, Ed Koch, my predecessor in the district that I represent. It stood absolutely no chance of passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've come a long way since then, but our progress has been hard-fought and incremental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of our greatest legislative victories have only been achieved step by step. The measure before us today is by no means complete or definitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad truth is that transgender Americans need and deserve protection from employment discrimination. All too often they bear the brunt of brutal bigotry, and are subject to unspeakable hatred and violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I strongly support providing protection from discrimination to transgender Americans. And I will not rest until their right to live their lives free of fear, discrimination and intolerance is the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986, when I served on the New York City Council, we succeeded in passing legislation to bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment and housing. That bill had come before the Council repeatedly since 1971. It took 15 years, but we finally managed to pass it. It was only later that the Council enacted specific protections for the transgender community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many said the 19th Amendment didn't go far enough when that passed. While it gave women the right to vote, it didn't address a host of social inequities between men and women, many of which persist today. Decades after that Amendment was ratified, we passed the Equal Pay Act and title VII. And, while we still haven't passed the Equal Rights Amendment, I remain optimistic that our day will soon come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New Direction Democratic Congress passed a hate crimes bill earlier this year that included important protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And we hope to have another important victory here today. I'm confident these incremental successes will lay the foundation for additional protections for the entire LGBT community in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, while I deeply regret that transgender Americans are not protected by the legislation before us today, I nonetheless urge my distinguished colleagues to support it. I do so with the knowledge and the determination that we will be back to continue to press the fight for all Americans to live free from discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to help make history today by supporting this landmark legislation and taking this important step towards ensuring that discrimination based on sexual orientation will not be tolerated in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Speaker PELOSI, Congressman FRANK, and Congresswoman BALDWIN for their leadership in this critical battle for civil rights.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a strong supporter of inclusive ENDA that provides employment protections for sexual orientation as well as gender identity, I am an original cosponsor of the original ENDA that was introduced earlier this year, the legislation we should be taking up today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of New Jersey, we are proud to have a fully inclusive employment nondiscrimination law. We are proud of the New Jersey-based businesses that have corporate policies against discrimination based on gender identity, in addition to sexual orientation. Companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck and Prudential Financial prohibit employment discrimination based on gender identity, not only because they believe it's the right thing to do morally and ethically, but also they know it's  a matter of corporate competitiveness and good for their companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our distinguished colleague JOHN LEWIS often reminds us of the words of Dr. King, "The time is always right to do the right thing." Dr. King warned us against the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. I am concerned that when we break apart legislation, some pieces fall on the floor to get swept into the dustbin of history or to be considered only years later. We should not do this to members of our society who need and deserve the same protections as all other Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the members of Garden State Equality, New Jersey Stonewall Democrats, the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition for their hard work and tireless efforts for inclusive protections.

    <paragraph>SERVICES, INC.,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN HOLT: I would like to express Johnson &amp; Johnson's support for <bill type="h" number="2015">H.R. 2015</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). This legislation is essential in providing federal protections to prevent workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we recognize employees as the cornerstone of our success. For this reason, the company adheres to a vigorous Equal Employment Opportunity Policy that provides a working environment free of discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation. This policy is consistent with our commitment to ensuring the respect of our employees and guaranteeing each individual a sense of security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe that <bill type="h" number="2015">H.R. 2015</bill> is a very important step towards addressing employment discrimination and fostering true equality. In addition to establishing federal protections, ENDA legislation also creates an enforcement mechanism through the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC). This enforcement power has led to the monumental successes of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991. I look forward to working with you in the future to achieve our mutual  goal of eradicating workplace discrimination. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may provide further assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Best regards,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We dissent from <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, a narrow version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) that excludes protections based on gender identity. We are co-sponsors of <bill type="h" number="2015">H.R. 2015</bill>, the original version of ENDA introduced earlier this year, that would prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While we agree with <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>'s objective of prohibiting workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, we do not support the decision to remove gender identity  from the bill because it leaves this legislation woefully incomplete. <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> fails to expressly protect transgender people, who are among the most at risk for discrimination. The decision to strip gender identity from the bill was not based on substantive concerns about</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transgender individuals and their families aspire to the same basic rights as other Americans, including equal access to gainful employment and fair housing in safe communities. Yet across this country, transgender people face extremely high rates of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness. Studies across the country reveal that transgender people suffer a 35% unemployment rate, with 60% earning less than $15,300 a year. As a result of this disparity in income and employment levels, a disproportionate  number of transgender people cannot support themselves or their families, and many are literally forced onto the streets. Every American has the right to be free from discrimination in employment and to be judged solely on one's performance in the workplace--not on irrelevant characteristics such as sexual orientation and gender identity. We are eager to support legislation that addresses such discrimination, and we wish that we would have had an opportunity to do so in Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe that Congress should pursue the path that state legislatures have uniformly followed for the past several years, which is to pass measures that include both sexual orientation and gender identity. Such inclusive laws have passed on the local and state level in jurisdictions in every region of the country. Nationally, 37% of the U.S. population lives in jurisdictions that prohibit gender identity discrimination. Currently, there are inclusive laws in twelve states and over 90 local  jurisdictions, including Iowa, New Jersey, Colorado, and Oregon, which passed inclusive laws just this year. Congress should be reinforcing these efforts instead of undermining advancement on the state and local level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard overwhelmingly from constituents and civil rights organizations that passage of this non-inclusive bill will undermine the ultimate attainment of full employment protections for all LGBT individuals. We are not aware of a single gay or LGBT organization that has endorsed this bill. In contrast, over 300 organizations have formally opposed <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> because it omits gender identity protections. These include national groups such as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, National Center for Lesbian Rights, Equality Federation, National Black Justice Coalition, National Association of LGBT Community Centers, Pride At Work (AFL-CIO), PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and the National Center for Transgender Equality. Also in opposition is nearly every single statewide organization that represents</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the reasons set forth herein, we respectfully dissent from <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am waiting for some conservatives to come to the floor, I am waiting for some true intellectually consistent conservative Members of the other party who understand that in their mantra of government staying out of people's private lives, in their mantra of allowing the marketplace to work, allowing people to be judged by their hard work, by their tenacity, by their skill, I am waiting for those people to come to the floor and say that we believe in ENDA. We believe in the idea  of not government selecting who's going to win but letting the marketplace do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe in our friends in the private sector, 350 or so Fortune 500 companies that already practice ENDA that we are going to be voting on today. Where are they? Where are those Members of my colleague's party that are shamed by their record on civil rights throughout the years and want to make it right now? Where are the Members of that party who are going to come forward and say, I don't want to explain to my grandkids why I was on the wrong side of another civil rights movement? Where are  those Members of that party who claim to be conservative? Speak up now. This is your moment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), our distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions, a Member who has been outspoken in his fight against discrimination for all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I rise in support of the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize a point of agreement and a point of disagreement: There is a broad and growing agreement that members of the transgendered community should receive the full protection of the Federal law, and many of us are committed to work to achieve that day as soon as we possibly can. But there is a strong point of disagreement that I have heard from the minority side about the procedure on which we are taking up this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a vigorous debate in the full committee about this bill and three concerns were raised. One was the issue of the transgendered community, and Ms. Baldwin has in order an amendment, which she will decide the disposition of, so that issue can be raised. The second is the scope of the religious exemption, which my friends vigorously debated, and Mr. Miller and Mr. Stupak's manager's amendment raises that very same issue, and there will be a debate and there will  be a disposition. Finally, there was some discussion as to the impact of this bill on the question of the definition of marriage, and the amendment of Mr. Miller and Mr. Stupak will make in order a debate and a disposition of that issue as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the House, with all due respect to my friends on the other side, the purpose of the House is not to debate every issue for as long as it takes until everyone is done talking. The purpose of the House is to have a fair and reasonable proceeding and to decide, and that is what we are going to do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just say one final thing to my friend, and I know he is going to ask me to yield, and I will do so if he agrees to yield to me when my time has expired. But my friend speaks with great enthusiasm to bringing to a vote on the floor the question of transgendered people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my friend why, for the previous 12 years that his group has had the majority here, they never brought the issue to the floor during  those 12 years if they have such intense feelings in favor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield to my friend.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would probably respond to your direct question that for the same reason for the 20 years prior to that your party didn't bring it up either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I want to say, and I thank the gentleman for yielding, the gentleman said that the purpose of the House is not to debate every issue. I would tend to agree with that. But I think that the gentleman would have to agree with me that when there are propositions that are made in order, whether it is a bill or whether it is an amendment, that they ought to be debated and disposed of by the House and not be covered up, if you will.</paragraph>
