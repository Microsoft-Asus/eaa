  <narrative>INTRODUCTION OF THE CHAMP ACT AND PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO 5 MILLION MORE KIDS -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8403]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BRALEY of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, is one of the most important and worthwhile programs in our government. It was created with broad bipartisan support by Congress in 1997, and provides critical health care benefits to children whose parents either cannot afford insurance, or hold jobs where health insurance benefits are not provided. Today, 6 million children and low-income families have health care because of this SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, Democrats in this body introduced legislation known as the CHAMP Act, which would reauthorize SCHIP, preventing it from expiring on September 30, leaving these 6 million children without access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHAMP Act would also extend SCHIP coverage to 5 million additional uninsured American kids, and ensure that States have the tools to reach children who are eligible for the program, but are not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the CHAMP Act. By passing it, we will reauthorize SCHIP to protect health care benefits for up to 6 million children currently receiving them, and provide it to an additional 5 million who desperately need it.</paragraph>
