    <paragraph>Madam President, change is on the way, but it didn't get here tonight. The American people said they wanted change in the Senate, but it is not here yet. I think it was proven tonight by this vote. The American people will see who stands with the middle class of this country and who doesn't, who cares about working people and who doesn't by this vote tonight. Anyone could have picked a number of reasons for voting no tonight, but as far as I am concerned, with this economy in crisis,  we should have voted yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I wish to say is we are going through tough times and tomorrow things are going to be a whole lot tougher for a whole lot of people, unless Henry Paulson does the right thing. I wish to say to my colleagues, Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow--I know they are headed out, which is fine--that I am going to work as hard as I can to convince the Treasury Secretary to take action to save these 3 million jobs that could be on the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People played Russian roulette with this recession tonight. We don't know what is going to happen, but we do know that Hank Paulson can save these jobs. If he can save all those jobs in the white-collar industry, certainly he can save some jobs in the blue-collar industries. Everyone knows I have had problems with Detroit. I think the fact that they didn't listen to those of us who felt they ought to produce clean cars and fuel-efficient cars, the fact that they didn't listen to us led to, in  many ways, the problems they face. To lose our manufacturing base, without even a helping hand to try and save it tonight, is shocking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in closing, I wish to say I have a heavy heart right now. I have 200,000 workers in my State, second only to Detroit, who depend on a thriving auto industry. That is 200,000 families, frightened tonight, but I have a message for them: HELP is on the way. Change is on the way. Change is coming to this Chamber. We are going to have people who are here for the right reason--what I consider the right reason--which is fighting for the middle class, fighting to make sure we have a clean environment,  a strong economy, educated kids, peace in the world, all those things. That is what the election was about. This is a lameduck Senate, and they acted like a lameduck Senate. It is too bad. But we did get a majority vote, so the message to Mr. Paulson is:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see Senator Durbin is on the floor and is about to speak. I wish to thank him, Senator Dodd, and Senator Reid, all those who worked so hard and those on the other side who tried--who actually tried--to do something. So I yield the floor, with a heavy heart, but I know that the future is going to be much brighter, much better.</paragraph>
