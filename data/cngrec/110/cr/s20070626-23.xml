  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the distinguished career of Frank Monahan, who will retire in a few days after 36 years of service to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1971, Frank Monahan has worked on many of the great social justice issues of our day, always taking the side of the vulnerable, the voiceless, and the victims, always standing firm in his belief that here on earth, God's work must be our own. In the finest Jesuit tradition of his alma mater, Loyola University of Chicago, Frank Monahan is a man who has dedicated himself to serving others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early in his career, he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nigeria. He was responding to President Kennedy's call to a new generation of Americans to engage themselves in public service and to help spread hope and the message of peace and cooperation throughout the world. He went on to work in Chicago public schools, helping to implement antipoverty programs and improve school lunch programs so that poor and hungry children would be free to learn, without fear of want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His good nature, strong commitment, and eternal optimism that we can leave the world better than we found it will be missed by all of us in Congress, but they will not soon be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been my great privilege through the years--under seven different Presidential administrations--to work with Frank on issues of fundamental fairness and justice. When I think of him, I am reminded of my brother Robert F. Kennedy's words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Frank Monahan for the countless ripples of hope he has sent out in his career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will be sad to see him leave, but heart in the fact that this great friend and ally will continue, in new and different fields, to live out the words of the Gospel of Mathew:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has certainly earned his retirement. As Frank and his family look forward to meeting the new challenges and opportunities that lay ahead, I am sure God is looking down on him now and saying, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."</paragraph>
