    <paragraph>Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on June 4, 2008, by the President of the United States: Tax Convention with Bulgaria with Proposed Protocol of Amendment, Treaty Document No. 110-18. I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered  to be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The message of the President is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income, with accompanying Protocol, signed at Washington on February 23, 2007 (the "Proposed Treaty"), as well as the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the  Government of the Republic of Bulgaria for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Sofia on February 26, 2008 (the "Proposed Protocol of Amendment"). The Proposed Treaty and Proposed Protocol of Amendment are consistent with U.S. tax treaty policy. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Proposed Treaty and Proposed Protocol of Amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The Proposed Treaty generally reduces the withholding tax on cross-border dividend, interest, and royalty payments. Importantly, the Proposed Treaty generally eliminates withholding tax on cross-border dividend payments to pension funds and cross-border interest payments made to financial institutions. The Proposed Treaty also contains provisions, consistent with current U.S. tax treaty policy, that are designed to prevent so-called treaty shopping. The Proposed Protocol of Amendment further  strengthens these treaty shopping provisions.</chair>
  <chair>I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Proposed Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification to both the Proposed Treaty and the Proposed Protocol of Amendment.</chair>
  <chair>George W. Bush.</chair>
  <chair>The White House June 4, 2008. </chair>
