  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a dedicated public servant, Marvin Farbman, who is retiring after 30 years of tireless work at Connecticut Legal Services, CLS, on behalf of the people of Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Farbman came to Connecticut Legal Services in 1977 with an impressive academic record. He received his undergraduate degree in biology at Boston University, his M.A. in Philosophy from the University of Western Ontario, and finally his law degree at the University of Connecticut, where he graduated with honors. Connecticut Legal Services hired him as a staff attorney, where he quickly took on more than 100 client cases per year, serving as counsel for low-income Connecticut families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 30 years, Marvin Farbman worked tirelessly to provide better housing for low-income residents of Connecticut. Only a year after joining the staff of Connecticut Legal Services, he created Equity in Housing, a ground-breaking housing cooperative that continues serving low-income households today. Within 2 years, Mr. Farbman was promoted to the position of managing attorney of the Middletown office of Connecticut Legal Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his years as managing attorney, Mr. Farbman continued to lead the fight for low-income housing improvements both in and out of the courtroom. He served as lead counsel in several influential court cases, including Korsko v. Harris, which stopped the conversion of a federally-subsidized 200-unit housing project into private condominiums with no assistance for low-income residents, Nelson v. Heintz, a successful lawsuit against the City of Bridgeport to obtain more reasonable shelter payment  levels for low-income citizens, and Father Panik Village Tenants Assoc. v. Cisneros, which obtained a preliminary court settlement requiring the Bridgeport Housing Authority to replace more than 1,000 demolished public housing units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Farbman's dedication and continued success in court was matched by the success of his other efforts to improve the community. In 1985, he led the effort to create the Middlesex Red Cross homeless shelter, the first apartment-based family shelter in Connecticut. He also organized a local coalition to renovate Arriwani Hotel, a single room flophouse, into a nonprofit apartment building with support services for residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he was promoted to executive director of CLS in 1995, Mr. Farbman successfully guided the agency in the establishment of an operating plan to begin rebuilding its service capacity. Over his tenure as executive director, Connecticut Legal Services handled approximately 50,000 client cases, improving the lives of countless Connecticut residents and the communities where they live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of Americans live in poverty, and many must depend on people like Marvin Farbman to fight for their basic needs in court. Mr. Farbman has dedicated his life to improving the lives of low-income families, and his influence can be seen throughout Connecticut. For his dedicated service, Connecticut, and indeed, the whole nation owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 8, a dinner will be held in honor of Marvin Farbman's many contributions to Connecticut Legal Services and the field of legal representation for low-income families. This dinner will be a wonderful tribute to Marvin's dedication to serving underprivileged residents of Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I extend my deep thanks to Marvin Farbman for his long legacy of service to his community, to the people of Connecticut, and to our Nation. I wish to congratulate him, his wife Evelyn, and his sons Daniel and Herschel on this wonderful occasion, and I wish him well as he embarks on this new chapter in his life.</paragraph>
