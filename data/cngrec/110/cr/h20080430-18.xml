    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States is intending to send $1.4 billion in taxpayer money to Mexico to fight the cartel drug criminals on the border. This may sound good on the surface, but there are problems with sending money south of the border. It's an unfortunate reality that border corruption exists between Mexican law enforcement and the drug cartels. America has no assurance that some of that money or equipment won't end up in the very hands of the people we're trying to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This $1.4 billion would be better spent if it stayed in America. It should go to the Border Sheriffs Coalition. These are hard-nosed lawmen from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego, California, that operate on a shoestring budget, and they know better how to stop the drug smugglers and coyotes from entering their counties. I have met with them numerous times along our southern border. These border lawmen are amazing crime fighters and protectors of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 18 Texas border sheriffs unanimously believe that, "the culture of corruption and smuggling both in narcotics and humans and the threat of terrorism on the border will increase" if this money is sent to Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's help out our first responders and give them the tools to fight crime on the border and keep the money in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
