    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could say a brief word here, I hope the distinguished Republican leader has gotten the information--we tried to do it through staff--that sometime between 3 and 6 tomorrow, we will do a vote on the motion to reconsider that we had on the cloture vote. Then thereafter or sometime during the day tomorrow I will talk to the distinguished Republican leader and find out what happens next. There are a number of alternatives we have as to what we can do on Friday, but I  will talk to my friend from Kentucky and try to work something out; otherwise, we will advise him what we are going to do.</paragraph>
