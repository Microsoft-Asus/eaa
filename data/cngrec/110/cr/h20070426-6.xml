  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I welcome my good friend, Monsignor George Coyne, to the Congress this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Monsignor Coyne since I was a young boy and he was a student in the seminary. At that time, he was also working for my grandfather in our family business. My entire family came to know him well. Monsignor Coyne set such a good example that his brothers, Jerry and Tim, followed him as employees of our family business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even back then, Monsignor carried a deep faith and a commitment to serving others in our community, which he has all of his life as a priest. All of these years later, his faith and commitment are more evident than ever. Today, Monsignor Coyne serves the parishioners at two churches in eastern Ohio: Saint Joseph Church in Tiltonsville, and Saint Lucy Church in Yorkville.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as I have, parishioners at Saint Joseph and Saint Lucy have witnessed Monsignor Coyne's passion firsthand. Today the Congress and the viewers across the Nation have had their chance to see what makes Monsignor Coyne such a special person. For that I am deeply grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to thank Monsignor Coyne for joining us here today and for his years of dedicated service to the people of eastern Ohio.</paragraph>
