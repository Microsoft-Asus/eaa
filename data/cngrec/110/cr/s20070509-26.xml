    <paragraph>Mr. President, in 1932 Ray Yarnell bought a bankrupt dairy in Searcy, AR, and created the Yarnell Ice Cream Company. At the time, there were 43 ice cream companies in business in Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ray's son Albert began working for the company at the age of 12, riding his bicycle to deliver bills. During World War II, Albert Yarnell left to serve his country as a member of the Army Signal Corps. After his service, he studied dairy production at the University of Missouri and returned to work at the Yarnell Ice Cream Company in 1948. With the passing of his father in 1974, Albert Yarnell became the president of the company. In 1978, he personally created the Nation's first all-natural ice  milk, and after becoming chairman of the company in 1985, he led the team that invented the Nation's first non-fat, no-sugar-added ice cream in 1990. He is affectionately known in his hometown of Searcy and at the company as "Mr. Albert."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A very successful family business, the Yarnell Ice Cream Company now stands as the only remaining ice cream producer in Arkansas. Albert's son Rogers is the current president of the company and Albert's granddaughter Christina is the treasurer. Albert and his wife Doris both contribute to and are deeply respected in the community they have called home for so many years. Mr. Yarnell also serves on several boards, including Main Street Searcy, the Baptist Health Corporation, the Searcy Chamber  of Commerce, as well as the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, Albert Yarnell was inducted into the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame. He joins other distinguished members such as Sam Walton, Jackson Stephens, Don Tyson, and J.B. Hunt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating both Albert Yarnell, the patriarch of the Ice Cream Industry, and the Yarnell Ice Cream Company on the company's 75th anniversary.</paragraph>
