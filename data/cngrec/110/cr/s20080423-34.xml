  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 2901. A bill to encourage residential mortgage loan modifications and workout plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2901">S. 2901</bill>] Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a bill to give mortgage servicers an incentive to work out new loan terms with struggling homeowners who are falling behind in their mortgage payments. It is possible to avoid foreclosure in some cases by reworking the payment terms on mortgages. Investors, however, would have to accept a smaller return on their investment than they otherwise may have expected. As a result, businesses that service mortgage loans may fear litigation  from investors who are the direct or indirect holders of those mortgages. This concern may be slowing the pace of or stopping loan modifications. In testimony on December 6, 2007, before the House Committee on Financial Services, Mark Pearce, speaking on behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, testified that at a meeting with the top 20 subprime servicers "many of them brought up fear of investor lawsuits" as a hurdle to voluntary loan modification efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The loan servicers have a legal duty to the investors to maximize the return on their investments. But in light of the current and changing economic environment, and the new and complex financial vehicles that hold mortgages, this "duty" is not simple or clear. This bill clarifies matters by stating that, absent contract provisions to the contrary, the duty is owed to the investor group as a whole, and not to individual investors or classes of investors. In addition, the bill clarifies that  the servicer satisfies that duty by ensuring that the return from a mortgage, as modified, exceeds the return that would be expected from foreclosure. This may include agreeing to mortgage modifications or workout plans when a homeowner is in payment default, or when default or foreclosure appears imminent. Although some investors may get a smaller return than they</paragraph>
    <paragraph>may have expected, in the long run, taking these actions will be in the best interest of all investors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not a bailout. The bill honors contract provisions that may be contrary to provisions in the bill. This bill would not solve all of the problems we face today, but it is an important step in removing barriers that may slow progress as we work to solve the home mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is necessary because regulation has not kept pace with innovation. Years ago, a homeowner would obtain a mortgage from a local bank. If he couldn't make the mortgage payment, the bank often would be willing and able to offer a workout, modifying the loan's terms to make it affordable. The bank would do this because whatever amount the borrower could pay would be worth more to the bank than foreclosure. Foreclosure has its costs, sometimes as much as half the value of the mortgage, and  banks did not want to have to resell the home, so the calculation was often simple. Today, however, many mortgages are often bundled together with others mortgages and are sold to investment banks, who in turn slice and dice the bundles to produce securities that are rated by rating agencies and sold to investors all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investment banks that issue securities backed by mortgages typically divide the securities into tranches, with some tranches having claims that are senior to other more junior tranches. None of this, of course, is transparent to the homeowner, and servicers face a complex situation. Servicers should not have to first determine precisely how a loan modification will affect the various tranches of investors and then make choices among the groups. If the servicer reasonably believes that a modification  increases the net present value of the investment as a whole, it should be able to agree to the modification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke encouraged the nation's bankers to write down the principle on millions of mortgages. He said banks have not made nearly enough modifications to stop foreclosures. But there has been some progress. Treasury Secretary Paulson reported this month that "since July more than one million struggling homeowners received a workout--either a loan modification or a repayment plan that helped them avoid foreclosure." In January alone, there were 167,000  such modifications, with the number of borrowers receiving help rising faster than the number of foreclosures. Congress needs to ensure that these modifications continue, and that they continue at a rapid pace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are faced with a crisis caused by mortgage brokers who pushed risky loans on homeowners, homeowners who assumed the value of their home would always increase, conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies, bond underwriters who loosened standards, lax regulators, and financial institutions that ignored the risks in the instruments they were buying and selling. There is plenty of blame to go around  but Congress must now take steps to prevent similar  problems in the future. Right now, we must do what we can to keep families in their homes by encouraging the companies that service mortgages to modify mortgages where it will prevent foreclosure. This bill will encourage servicers to make such modifications and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Encouraging Mortgage Modifications Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) mortgage modifications often afford the best opportunity to avoid foreclosures and provide long term, sustainable solutions for American homeowners;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) reaching mortgage modification agreements with homeowners has been unacceptably slow and foreclosure rates continue to rise, with the number of homeowners forced into foreclosure double the number who receive modifications or repayment plans;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) servicers have an obligation to protect the interests of investors when determining whether to offer a modification or repayment plan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the best course of action for the investor pool as a whole may disadvantage the interests of individual classes of investors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) servicers have expressed concern that investor classes that are disproportionately disadvantaged by a modification or repayment plan may seek to hold the servicer liable;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) without liability protection, many servicers will not be willing to take on the risk associated with approving a mortgage modification or repayment plan, and instead, they will eventually pursue foreclosure even though foreclosure costs can equal 50 percent or more of mortgage value; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the net present value of a modified mortgage loan will almost always exceed the amount recouped by allowing the home to go into foreclosure.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2902. A bill to ensure the independent operation of the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, ensure complete analysis of potential impacts on small entities of rules, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2902">S. 2902</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Pryor, during National Small Business Week, to introduce the Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008. This bipartisan measure would ensure the independence of the Small Business Administration, SBA, Office of Advocacy, and provide targeted small business regulatory reforms that would strengthen the Office of Advocacy's voice in protecting our small businesses. Our bill is supported  by the SBA Office of Advocacy and National Ombudsman, as well as the National Federation of Independent Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I recognize that the SBA Office of Advocacy is, regrettably, one of our Government's best kept secrets, and in many cases, the best hope for small businesses faced with overly burdensome Federal regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established in 1976, the Office of Advocacy, headed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is a unique office within the Federal Government. First, the Office of Advocacy is the "Regulatory Watchdog" for small businesses. In this capacity, it represents small businesses before the Federal Government in regulatory matters--taking advantage of its statutorily granted independence to argue against Federal regulatory actions that impose too great a burden on small businesses for too little benefit--and  to encourage Federal agencies to consider less costly regulatory alternatives. Second, it conducts valuable research to further our understanding of the importance of small businesses to our economy and the forces that have an effect on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SBA Office of Advocacy is part of the SBA, and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the office is also intended to be the "independent" voice for small business within the Federal Government. It is charged with the duty of representing the views and interests of small businesses before other Federal agencies, and developing proposals for changing government policies to help small businesses. These roles can sometimes  come into conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 resolves such conflicts in favor of the small businesses that rely on the Chief Counsel and the Office of Advocacy to be a fully independent advocate within the executive branch. The bill would help to reinforce a clear mandate that the Office of Advocacy must fight on behalf of small businesses, regardless of the position taken  on critical issues by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding for the Office of Advocacy currently comes from the "Salaries and Expense Account" of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated by the SBA administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall staff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time employees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of Advocacy. The current allocation of staff is 48. The independence and effectiveness of the office is potentially diminished when the Office of Advocacy staff is reduced,  at the discretion of the administrator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address this problem, the Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 builds a firewall to minimize political intrusion into the management of day-to-day operations of the Office of Advocacy similar to the one that protects Inspectors General in other agencies. The bill would require the Federal budget to include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy drawn directly from General Fund of the Treasury. No longer would its funds come from the general  operating account of the SBA. This will free the Chief Counsel for Advocacy from having to seek approval from the SBA administrator to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would leave unchanged current law that allows the Chief Counsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of Advocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures directed by Federal law and the Office of Personnel Management, OPM. This long-standing special hiring authority, which is limited only to employees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it allows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best assist the Office in responding  to changing issues and problems confronting small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to protecting the Office of Advocacy's independence, this bill also provides targeted small business regulatory reform. As the Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I have long fought to ensure that small businesses across the country are treated fairly by the Federal Government. Unfortunately, in far too many cases, Federal agencies promulgate rules and regulations without adequately addressing the economic impacts on small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The disproportionate burden that Federal regulations often place on our small businesses cannot be overemphasized. Research published by the Office of Advocacy indicates that small businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each year complying with government rules and regulations. More specifically, the smallest firms with fewer than 20 employees, spend approximately 45 percent more per employee than larger firms to comply with Federal regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) recognizes this situation, as it requires Federal Government agencies to propose rules that keep the regulatory burden at a minimum on small businesses. Enacted in 1980, the RFA requires Federal agencies to analyze the economic impact of proposed regulations when there is likely to be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In 1996, I was pleased to support, along with all of my colleagues, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement  Fairness Act, (SBREFA), which amended the RFA. The intent of SBREFA was to further curb the impact of burdensome or duplicative regulations on small businesses, by clarifying key RFA requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Independent Office of Advocacy and Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 would further improve the Regulatory Flexibility Act by requiring Federal agencies to consider and specifically respond to comments provided by Office of Advocacy. This critical change would ensure that agencies give the proper deference to the Office of Advocacy, and to the comments and concerns of small businesses. This is a straightforward and simple reform that could have major benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our proposal would also clarify that Federal agencies are required to provide pertinent information to the SBA Ombudsman upon request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This noncontroversial, bipartisan legislation is absolutely necessary. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can ensure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy in all matters, and provide our Nation's small businesses and their employees with much needed targeted regulatory relief.</paragraph>
