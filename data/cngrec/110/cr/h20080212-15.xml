    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3332">H.R. 3332</bill> would provide for the establishment of a memorial within the boundaries of the Kalaupapa National Historic Park on the island of Molokai, Hawaii. It will serve as a remembrance of thousands of Hansen's disease patients who were forcibly separated from family and friends and interned at this site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning in 1866, when the Hawaii Islands were still an independent kingdom, and continuing through 1969, residents of the islands who were infected with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, were isolated from the rest of society at the settlement. In all, 8,000 Hansen's patients were forcibly relocated to the settlement where they struggled to create new lives. The majority succumbed to the disease while living there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, less than 20 percent of the graves and headstones of these former patients can be found in the peninsula. The remaining 80 percent are forgotten on the landscape. A nonprofit organization made up of family and friends of former patients will be responsible for funding and constructing the memorial which will contain the names of all 8,000 patients who were forced to call this settlement their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend our colleague, Congresswoman Hirono of Hawaii, and her cosponsor, Congressman Abercrombie, also of Hawaii, for their efforts to ensure that all families of former residents have a fitting commemoration of their deceased loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we enthusiastically support <bill type="h" number="3332">H.R. 3332</bill> and urge its passage today as a tribute to the present and past Hansen's patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="3332">H.R. 3332</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kalaupapa is a 2 1/4 -mile-wide shelf of land jutting out beneath sea cliff ranging from 1,600 to 3,000 feet in height on the island of Molokai. It is an incredibly beautiful and isolated area with a unique history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes the establishment of a memorial at Kalaupapa National Historical Park in the memory of those who were forcibly relocated there because they suffered from or were suspected of having Hansen's disease, or leprosy. Once sent to Kalaupapa, most never saw their homes or their families again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kahauliko, Loe, Liilii, Puha, Kini, Lono, Waipio, Kainana, Kaumoana, Nahuina, Lakapu, and Kepihe. These are the names of the first 12 people who were exiled to Kalaupapa on January 6, 1886, 142 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This poster is a copy of the Kingdom of Hawaii's register, now at the Hawaii State Archives, of those sent to Kalaupapa Peninsula. These first 12 were all Native Hawaiians, nine men and three women. From that day forward until 1969, approximately 8,000 people living in the Hawaii Islands were taken from their families and isolated on Kalaupapa Peninsula, first in Kalawao, and later in the town of Kalaupapa. Because of society's fear of leprosy, which we now call Hansen's disease, food was scarce,  and shelter and health care were minimal for the new arrivals. The mortality rate for exiles in the first 5 years was 46 percent due to the poor conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"An Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy" was first signed into law in 1865 by Lot Kamehameha, the King of Hawaii. The act essentially criminalized the disease. Children, mothers, and fathers were forcibly separated. Children born to parents at Kalaupapa were taken away from their mothers and sent to live in orphanages or with other family members outside of Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The policy was continued in the Republic of Hawaii after Hawaii was annexed by the United States and into statehood. Hawaii's isolation laws for people with Hansen's disease were not repealed until 1969, 10 years after statehood, even though medications to control the disease have been available since the late 1950s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 6,700 of the approximately 8,000 people who have died at Kalaupapa, more than 75 percent, lie in unmarked or unidentifiable graves. Their names are known only in the official records, which are not easily accessible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A memorial listing the names of those who were exiled to Kalaupapa and died there is a fitting tribute and is consistent with the purpose of the park, to preserve and interpret the Kalaupapa settlement for the education and inspiration of present and future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many have heard of the sacrifices of Father Damien, who is represented by one of Hawaii's two statues in this Capitol, as well as those of Mother Marianne Cope and Brother Dutton, who each gave decades of their lives to care for the patients at Kalaupapa. Fewer know, however, of the courage and sacrifices of the exiles who were torn from their families and all they knew to make a life in this isolated area. It is important that their lives be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kalaupapa memorial will bring these people back to their rightful places in their family genealogy and history. Many families have gone to Kalaupapa to search for the graves of their ancestors; but with only 1,300 marked graves, most are disappointed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a letter of support for the memorial, David and Chris Mahelona explained why they, as Native Hawaiians, feel an urgent need for a monument that would list the names of everyone sent to Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quote: "The naming process and the giving of a Hawaiian name is an important and sacred component of traditional Hawaiian culture. It is said that names carry significant mana, spiritual power, and they are actually a part of the person, just like an arm or leg. In ancient Hawaii, a person's name was one of the most precious possessions unique to that individual, and most times related to an event, an ancestor, or a personality trait. In every case, the kapuna (elders) are always consulted.  It was the responsibility of the bearer of the name to carry its weight. Therefore, it is important to remember these people by their names at their final resting place."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to read the testimony that Kuulei Bell, president of Ka 'Ohana O Kalaupapa, submitted to Congress. Kuulei, who contracted Hansen's disease at age 6, is now 74. And I recently visited her at Queens Hospital in Honolulu.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kuulei testified: "We need to remember the people who have dedicated their lives and came to Kalaupapa. Father Damien, who we love so much, came to take care of all those in Kalaupapa in the 1800s, and he became one of us, contracted the disease, and so we know how this is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"And also we know that Mother Marianne gave her aloha and love with all the nuns to come and take care of the patients. They need to be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"These things are so important, and the monument is a big part of our history and our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>"So please consider what we are asking for is our history and for our children to know what happened to many  of our patients. How sad it was for my mother, who had to wait for me to go and she could not even touch me because of the disease. And I could not even touch my children. These are the things that we should consider, how important it is. These are the memories. So please consider these things. I say these things from my heart and I hope that  you hear it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kuulei ended her testimony thus: "Thank you for listening to this. Aloha and much aloha; much, much mahalo."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ka 'Ohana O Kalaupapa, a nonprofit organization consisting of patient residents at Kalaupapa National Historical Park and their family members and friends, was established in 2003 to promote the value and dignity of the exiles of Kalaupapa and to make certain that the lives of these individuals are honored and remembered through establishment of a memorial or memorials within the boundaries of the park at Kalawao or Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank House Natural Resources Committee Chair Nick Rahall and Parks Subcommittee Chair RAUL GRIJALVA for helping to move this important bill to the floor, and I also want to thank my cosponsor, Congressman NEIL ABERCROMBIE, for his strong support and assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all, I send my heartfelt aloha and mahalo to all the members of Ka 'Ohana O Kalaupapa, to all the Kalaupapa patients and their families, and most especially to Kuulei on this momentous day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all of my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="3332">H.R. 3332</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm once again appreciative of the remarks by the gentlewoman from Hawaii, and I'm also appreciative that now I know how to say "Kalaupapa." Her staff was very kind enough to send over the pronunciation guide, but they didn't put where the accent marks should go; so I didn't know where the emphasis was on this particular word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But with that, I am still very supportive of this particular act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time let me yield to my good friend from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) such time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I fully support the provisions of this proposed bill. The bill proposes to establish a memorial to honor the memory of all those people who became victims to the dreaded disease of leprosy, commonly known as Hansen's disease. I certainly want to commend my good friend and colleague the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono) and our colleague Congressman Abercrombie for their cosponsorship or sponsorship of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also want to commend the chairman of our committee, Chairman Rahall, and our ranking member, Mr. Young, for their support and their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1987, I was honored to be asked by the Polynesian Voyaging Society, under the leadership of my good friend and brother Nainoa Thompson, to serve as a member of the crew of the Hawaiian Polynesian voyaging canoe known as the Hokule'a on which we were able to sail from the island of Runayto near the island of Tahiti. We sailed to Hawaii by means of traditional noninstrument navigation. It took us about 27 days when we landed on the big island of Hawaii. From the island of Hawaii, we went to  Kalaupapa. It's Kalaupapa, located on the northern part of the island of Molokai, one of the islands that make up the State of Hawaii. This legislation brings back one of the most memorable experiences of my life, Mr. Speaker, my visit to Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kalaupapa is not only a national historical park but a place that has received international attention on account of the circumstances and events surrounding the history of what then took place under the sovereign kingdom of Hawaii in the early 1800s. Before the arrival of the Europeans, there were some 300,000 Native Hawaiians living on these islands. The warrior chief King Kamehameha with some 20,000 warriors and some 900 war canoes finally was able to unite these islands under one rule after  some 2,000 years of conflict among the ruling chiefs of these islands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What also occurred was the illnesses and the many diseases that Europeans brought to these islands, and one of these diseases was leprosy, or Hansen's disease. And the unfortunate situation at the time, having no knowledge or understanding of how they were going to cure it, the Native Hawaiians were not immune to this kind of sickness or illness. So the only way to, in any sense, prevent a health hazard was to send them to an isolated place where many of these Native Hawaiians became subjected  to this dreaded disease, leprosy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the process, we also had probably, in my humble opinion, Mr. Speaker, one of the great leaders in the world, a Catholic priest originally from Belgium, named Father Damien. Father Damien, if there is anything that I could ever say the epitome of what the pure love of God is, this was one man who voluntarily ministered to these people, who lived in this colony or this settlement. It was full of lepers, and he voluntarily subjected himself even to this contagious disease, after 12 years of helping  the people who lived there build chapels, build schools, and even helped bury those who died as a result of this dreaded disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Damien, as you know and maybe my colleagues are aware, was given as one of the two leaders representing the great State of Hawaii right here in Statuary Hall. And the beautiful story about this Catholic priest was the fact that he voluntarily gave his life in order to serve the people who contracted this dreaded disease leprosy on this beautiful area that is called Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was also another gentleman, and it might be as a matter of knowledge to my good friend from the State of Utah. At that time, it wasn't just people who were forced to have to live in this isolated settlement, but it caused so much sorrow and sadness where even those who were loved ones, your wives, your husbands, your daughters, your sons, and one of these leaders voluntarily went because his wife eventually contracted leprosy. His name was Jonathan Napela. He was a Native Hawaiian leader  and was a high priest and a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints, commonly known today as the Mormon Church. And because of the love of his wife, he voluntarily went and lived there, and he also contracted the disease of leprosy. It was known as the program of kokua.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interesting thing about Jonathan Napela was that this Native Hawaiian was able to translate the Book of Mormon from English into the Native Hawaiian language, along with another Mormon elder from Utah by the name of George Cannon. Jonathan Napela spent the last years of his life in this leper settlement because of the love for his wife, Kitty, who also contracted this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a lot of controversy about the life of Father Damien at the time. The relationships between the Protestants and the Catholics were not very positive. In fact, according to the records, a minister of the Presbyterian Church, Reverend Hyde, castigated and literally criticized Father Damien for some of the things that he did. And in response there was another noted leader at that time, an author and a Scotsman from Scotland, who happens to be Robert Louis Stevenson, who had also contracted  TB, tuberculosis. And trying to help his health, he spent the last 4 years of his life in my islands, the Samoan Islands. And to this day, Robert Louis Stevenson's grave is still there. Despite the wishes and desires of the Scottish people and the government to return his remains, we said no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the point that I wanted to make is that in response to the criticism that Father Damien got from his fellow ministers or those men of the cloth, I want to share with my colleagues Robert Louis Stevenson's response:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"When we have failed, and another has succeeded; when we have stood by, and another has stepped in; when we sit and grow bulky in our charming mansions," and he's talking about this minister, now, "and a plain, uncouth peasant steps into the battle, under the eyes of God, and succours the afflicted, and consoles the dying, and is himself afflicted in his turn, and dies upon the field of honour, the battle cannot be retrieved as your unhappy irritation has suggested. It is a lost battle, and  lost forever."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point of this is, Mr. Speaker, this national historical park Kalaupapa, I wish every Member of Congress would go and visit, just like my colleague from Hawaii, Congresswoman Hirono. It's one of the most beautiful areas and sites that anybody would ever want to see north of the island of Molokai.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to share this with my colleagues because this Kalaupapa is not as unknown as some people may think or believe, and I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii for having this proposed bill, that we should build a memorial to the thousands of Native Hawaiians and other races who had also contracted this dreaded disease and should be recognized for the sacrifices that they have had to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my good friend from Arizona for giving me time to speak.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="3332">H.R. 3332</bill>, the Kalaupapa Memorial Act of 2007. This measure would authorize Ka Ohana O Kalaupapa to establish a memorial to honor those who were forcibly relocated to Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kalaupapa is a National Historical Park located on a remote peninsula of northern Molokai. From 1866 through 1969, about 8,000 people afflicted with Hansen's disease, previously known as leprosy, were relocated to the area now known as Kalaupapa National Historical Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the first settlers faced a harsh and difficult life. But the patients who were sent to Kalaupapa eventually built a community that allowed them to endure a life cut off from parents, children, brothers, sisters and friends. Even after medication was developed to control Hansen's disease, many patient residents chose to continue living in Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The site became a national park in 1980 and is dedicated to preserving the memories and lessons of the past. Kalaupapa is a living memorial to a community that once lived in extreme isolation. It now serves as a place of education, contemplation and quiet beauty. Unfortunately, many of the residents who finished their life in Kalaupapa do not have recognizable graves or grave markers. The memorial established by this bill would serve as a permanent marker and reminder of all 8,000 residents who  lived on Kalaupapa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little more than 20 patients remain in Kalaupapa. As time passes, the number of former residents of Kalaupapa gets smaller, as do the number of people who remember this part of Hawaii's history. With each passing, the sense of urgency for erecting a memorial becomes more and more heightened. We need to pass this bill as soon as possible so that this memorial becomes a reality before the passing of the next Kalaupapa resident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague Representative Mazie Hirono has worked tremendously hard to bring this bill to the floor today. I commend her efforts and would also like to express my gratitude to Representative Nick Rahall, Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, and Representative Ra&#xFA;l Grijalva, Chairperson of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands. We would not be here today were it not for their support and enthusiasm. I wholeheartedly support this  bill, am proud to be an original cosponsor and ask my colleagues for their support of <bill type="h" number="3332">H.R. 3332</bill>.</paragraph>
