    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take great pride in recognizing the Army Aviation Association of America's, AAAA, 50th anniversary and in honoring their countless historic and noble contributions to the growth and strength of our Nation. Army aviation members play a critical role in every combat theater worldwide, and AAAA has proven to be a means of unwavering support. This unique organization has been the mechanism for increased communication and professional development among Army aviators  throughout the history of organic Army aviation and the Army Aviation Branch. This contribution has led to vast leaps in battlefield mobility, lethality, and flexibility for the U.S. Army. AAAA and its members have distinguished themselves with thousands of volunteer hours and dollars providing direct support and scholarships to Army aviation soldiers</paragraph>
