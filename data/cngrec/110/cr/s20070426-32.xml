  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the ways Congress maintains its contact with the American people is by the official report of the business we do. Through its recent modern history, we have published a Congressional Record so that people across this country, online and in printed form, can read the words of Senators and can follow the debate on the floor of the Senate. None of this effort would be productive or even possible were it not for those in the Office of the Official Reporters  of Debates who come here and follow every word that is spoken on the floor. They make these publications possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Jack Hickman, the Morning Business Clerk for the Congressional Record, is marking the end of his service to the Senate. In the future he will be able to listen to Senators and not remember a word. But at this point in time he has dispatched his official duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I speak for the entire Senate family, thanking Jack Hickman for his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
</record>
