    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the 2008 Agri-Business Farm Family of the year. This award goes to the VanDerVliet family: Rod and Lois VanDerVliet and their children, Ryan and Sarah VanDerVliet, Lisa and Jamie Johnson, and Lori and Ryan Fods; and their grandchildren Rhegan Oberg, Tyson VanDerVliet, Weston VanDerVliet, Parker Johnson, Devin Fods, and Clara VanDerVliet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 30 years the VanDerVliets have raised livestock and grain on their farm west of Colton, SD. Today, Rod's son Ryan, daughters Lisa and Lori, and son-in-law Ryan are an important part of the farm operation. Over the past several years the family has navigated the quickly changing farm industry and successfully utilized technology to ensure that the farm stays competitive and productive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Rod VanDerVliet sees farms becoming more business oriented than ever, he and his family love the farming lifestyle. Rod enjoys it because of its flexibility, connection to nature, and most importantly, because it is something that involves the whole family. Ryan shares his dad's love of farming and says he "like[s] being around the animals and the farming lifestyle." Both men would like to pass this way of life on to the next generation. And, with six grandchildren under the age of  six, there shouldn't be any shortage of help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The family's hard work has passed beyond the farmyard and into the community. The children grew up participating in 4-H and FFA. Rod has served on the Colton Farmers Elevator Board for more than 20 years and the MCWC Rural Water Board; Ryan serves on the township board, and the entire family is involved in numerous community organizations and activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VanDerVliets are an example of families that embody South Dakota values and form the bedrock of our great State. I am very proud to see a family-run farm successfully evolving in the changing industry while maintaining a commitment to their community and family. I commend them for this award, and I wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
