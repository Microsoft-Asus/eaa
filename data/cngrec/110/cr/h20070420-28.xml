    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2 days we will once again celebrate Earth Day, and this year's theme is a call to action on climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the last Earth Day in 2006, a number of important events have taken place that have dramatically raised awareness on the important issue of climate change. Two groundbreaking reports left no doubt that human beings are responsible for global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of California passed landmark legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A group of major businesses and leading climate and environmental groups joined forces for the first time to launch the Climate Action Partnership and lobby for Federal regulations of greenhouse gases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Gore won an Oscar for his powerful documentary on global warming, "An Inconvenient Truth."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of the Interior proposed listing the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to disappearing sea ice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark case that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United Nations Security Council had its first meeting on the issue of climate change as an urgent matter of international peace and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These events make the facts about climate change very clear. I am proud to say for the first time in a long time, this year's Earth Day finally holds the promise of real action on climate change, thanks to the election of a Democratic Congress last November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already, under the leadership of our Speaker, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy Pelosi, the House of Representatives has laid out a bold agenda to combat global warming and move America towards energy independence. For the first time, the House has created a Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming to help develop policy recommendations on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a part of our 100-hour agenda, the House also passed <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Clean Energy Act of 2007, repealing the $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies to profit-soaked oil companies. Instead of forcing our constituents to pay oil companies twice, once at the pump and again with their taxes, we shifted these funds to support the development of clean alternative energy and improved energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also passed a budget last month that makes substantial investments in research and development of new cutting-edge renewable energy technologies which will also fund the rapid deployment of these technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we are also committed to leading by example, our leadership has called upon the chief administrative officer of this House to develop and implement a "Green the Capitol" initiative. This initiative will reduce our energy consumption and develop sustainable practices for the United States Capitol and congressional office buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These initiatives are just the first step. Later this year, the House will also consider an innovation agenda that emphasizes the importance of developing alternative energy technologies and ensures that America continues to be a world leader in the green economy of the 21st century; also, a targeted energy package focusing on promoting energy alternatives and addressing global warming that will take another significant step forward in securing our energy independence; and a major farm bill that  will promote American-made biofuels as well as other renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will also continue to develop legislation to regulate greenhouse gases and address some of the difficult challenges in stopping global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the House moves forward with this agenda, we must also recognize that there is a substantial amount of activity that is already going on locally in our communities to combat climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, in the Bay Area, in my district in California, we represent the hub of the environmental movement. Research is ongoing into alternative and renewable energy at the University of California, Berkeley, one of the premier public universities in our country. We hold the promise of a cleaner and brighter future for our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bay Area businesses in my district have also taken the lead in greening their activities to reduce waste, improving energy efficiency, and save water, minimizing the impact on our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Innovative programs funded in part through the city of Oakland are also training youth in my district about the importance of environmental stewardship and are providing them with new job opportunities and new career paths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community-based organizations in my district have also taken the lead in advocating for environmental justice and equity for all of our constituents. Together, our community is at the forefront of a robust environmental movement that is quite literally changing the world for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this Earth Day, let us celebrate all of this local ingenuity, as well as what we are doing in the House of Representatives from participating in local cleanups to just shopping at our local farmers' markets.</paragraph>
