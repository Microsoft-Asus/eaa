  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Reverend Zane Fishel, who is the House of Representatives' guest chaplain today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Fishel comes to us from Pilot Mountain and Mount Airy, North Carolina, where he shepherds the flock at Temple Baptist Church. Reverend Fishel has faithfully served in the ministry of Temple Baptist since 1997 and he became the full-time youth minister in 1999 after sensing a call to serve God in the local church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the passing of Temple Baptist's pastor in 2003, Reverend Fishel took up his current role as the church's pastor, where he is devoted to spreading the good news to his congregation and community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his leadership, the church body at Temple Baptist Church in  Mount Airy has thrived. He has worked tirelessly to increase the outreach and effectiveness of Temple Baptist in the local community. He has shown a remarkable commitment to educating leaders in the local church so that many within the church can use their God-given gifts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that Reverend Fishel joined us today to open the House of Representatives with such an inspiring prayer. He is a model of service to God, country and community; and he plays a vital spiritual role in Surry County, North Carolina. I am proud to welcome him to the people's house.</paragraph>
