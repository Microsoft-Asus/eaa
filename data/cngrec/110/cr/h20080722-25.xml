    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="hc" number="364">H. Con. Res. 364</bill>, a resolution that recognizes the significance of National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>H. Con. Resolution 364, which has cosponsorship of 59 of our colleagues, was introduced by Representative Barbara Lee of California on May 22, 2008. It was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the history of the United States, persons of Caribbean descent have made significant contributions in the shaping of America's culture and character. Caribbean-Americans have become one of our greatest leaders, entrepreneurs, and entertainers, including such individuals as Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Colin Powell, James Weldon Johnson, Shirley Chisholm, Marion Jones, Juan Carlos Finlay, Oscar de la Renta, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Representative Lee for introducing this resolution. It provides us with an important opportunity to recognize and celebrate the contributions of Caribbean-Americans to the history, progress, and heritage of the United States. It is essential that we in the House support our fellow Americans and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hc" number="364">H. Con. Res. 364</bill>, recognizing the significance of National Caribbean American Heritage Month.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this resolution recognizing the significance of National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2006 each June our Nation has celebrated the influence and contributions of Caribbean-Americans, and we pay tribute to the bonds of friendship that unite us to our third border to the east: the Caribbean nations. A captivating mosaic of racial, cultural, and religious backgrounds, Caribbean-Americans come from a heritage sharing many historical and economic ties to our great Nation. Enduring the yoke of colonialism, the trials of slavery, and ultimate freedom of independence, Caribbean  nations mirror our vision of regional and global peace and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since first arriving in America in 1619, generations of Caribbean immigrants have enriched our Nation, weaving their vibrant culture, music, and rich traditions into our national fabric. Their talent, faith, and values helped shape the history of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Founding Father Alexander Hamilton to baseball legends such as Roberto Clemente and musical talents such as Bob Marley and Toots and the Maytals, they have strengthened the United States heritage. Their music enriches our ears and unique flavors warm our pallets. Their art and traditions enrich our souls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution in honor of the contributions of the past, the enduring vibrance of the more than 5 million Americans that share a Caribbean heritage and the historical bonds that unite our nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>First, let me thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins) for yielding, for managing the floor this afternoon on this resolution, and also for your leadership and for your support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution, <bill type="hc" number="364">H. Con. Res. 364</bill>, recognizing June as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. This resolution acknowledges the important contributions which Caribbean-Americans have made to our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me begin by thanking Chairman Waxman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and Ranking Member Tom Davis for helping to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor today. I also want to thank Congressman Danny Davis for his tremendous leadership on the subcommittee and for his support of this bill. I would like to also recognize all of our colleagues, and there are so many of our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, who have worked on issues related  to the  Caribbean for many, many years. I would like to acknowledge the Institute for Caribbean Studies and all other Caribbean-American organizations that worked to make Caribbean-American Heritage Month a great success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a long-time supporter of the Caribbean and a frequent visitor to the region, I was very proud to see us celebrate this important commemorative month for the 3rd year this year. Since the resolution's initial passage by Congress in 2006, the President has issued a proclamation recognizing Caribbean-American Heritage Month in June, 2006, 2007, and 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People of Caribbean heritage reside in every part of our country. Since 1820, millions of people have emigrated from the Caribbean region to the United States. Throughout United States history, we have been fortunate to benefit from countless individuals of Caribbean descent who have contributed to American government, politics, business, arts, education, and culture, including one of my personal sheroes, the Honorable, our beloved, the late Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shirley Chisholm was a woman of Bajan and Guyanese descent who never forgot her roots in the Caribbean. She was the first African American woman elected to Congress and the first woman and first African American to run for President. My political involvement actually began as a volunteer during her historic presidential campaign in 1972. Through her mentorship, she strengthened my interest in addressing issues of importance to the African Diaspora both here in the United States and abroad, including  the Caribbean and in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to Shirley Chisholm, during Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we also recognize people like Alexander Hamilton, Hazel Scott, Sidney Poitier, Wyclef Jean, Eric Holder, Colin Powell, Harry Belafonte, Celia Cruz; and, of course, our colleagues, daughters of the Caribbean, Congresswoman Donna Christensen, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, and many others who helped shape this country and continue to work on each and every issue  related to the U.S.-Caribbean affairs. These colleagues of ours, they are making a remarkable mark on the leadership which they bring to every issue as it relates to not only our domestic policy but our foreign policy. So they should be recognized and honored each and every day as well as during June of every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Caribbean-American Heritage Month also provided an opportunity for us to strengthen our long-term partnership with CARICOM through greater dialogue and engagement. From disaster preparedness, education, and the campaign against HIV/AIDS and other health disparities, trade and aid and development, we share a number of mutual policy interests with our Caribbean neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, last month we were able to address these important issues relating to the Caribbean through the Institute for Caribbean Studies' Caribbean-American Legislative Forum held right here on Capitol Hill. And I have to take a moment to thank a member of my staff, Nicole King, a daughter of St. Lucia, for her very effective staff work on this resolution and many of our legislative efforts related to the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Caribbean People International Collective, Inc. held a roundtable discussion on health in the immigrant community. This event promoted the goals and ideals of National Caribbean-American HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, this year's global rise in food costs keenly affected the people of the Caribbean, particularly our friends in Haiti. The crisis highlighted the need for reengagement and opened the door for innovative policy solutions. Under the extraordinary leadership of the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Members of Congress visited Haiti to come back with recommendations to address the emerging food crisis in Haiti, and it is a crisis.  Last month CARICOM heads of state held their New York Conference on the Caribbean--</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>As I was saying, Madam Speaker, CARICOM heads of state held their New York Conference on the Caribbean under the theme "A 20/20 Vision," where they met with regional policymakers, the academic community, private sectors, and financial institutions, as well as members of the Caribbean Diaspora, to better integrate policy interests between the United States and the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="364">H. Con. Res. 364</bill> promotes the importance of recognizing that our policies in the Caribbean affect us here in the United States. Caribbean-American Heritage Month reminded us of the large and diverse constituencies of Caribbean-Americans in our Nation and provided an opportunity to send a message of goodwill to the Caribbean community both here and abroad. This month also provided an opportunity to celebrate and share in the rich history and culture of our Caribbean neighbors through showcases  of Caribbean art festivals, concerts, and film. As an example, in my own district in Oakland, the Caribbean-American Association of Northern California celebrated the rich cultural heritage of the Caribbean through a musical concert and family day picnic.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I just want to conclude by recognizing once again activities in my district, the Second Annual Caribbean-American Heritage Legacy Award honoring the contribution of Caribbean-Americans. And here, of course, in Washington, D.C., the Caribbean Carnival hosted their annual carnival parade that drew more than 300,000 participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So just as we commemorate the achievements of the many diverse communities in our Nation, the United States Government should encourage all people to celebrate the rich history and diversity of Caribbean-Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you again for yielding the time, for your leadership, and for supporting this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412221" topic="">
    <paragraph>First, I would like to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the lead sponsor on this legislation, for her ongoing commitment and diligence in championing such an important resolution. She has served as a true advocate for national recognition of Caribbean people and their descendants in the United States. I also want to thank Congressman Higgins for his leadership and his support and management of this resolution to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a second generation Caribbean American, American by birth, Caribbean by parentage, specifically Jamaican, I am proud to be a cosponsor of <bill type="hc" number="364">H. Con. Res. 364</bill>. National Caribbean Heritage Month is for the millions of Caribbean people and their American descendants, an affirmation and much deserved recognition of their role and contribution to the growth and development of our Nation, as well as the region within this hemisphere from which these Americans, like myself, have come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Caribbean American Heritage Month was created to herald the unique historic relationship between the people of the Caribbean region and the United States and the many great contributions they have made to our country. For centuries now, Caribbean Americans have fortified this great Nation. Alexander Hamilton, born 1755 in the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, was the first Caribbean American from New York to serve in this body, then known as the Continental Congress. He has held  numerous cabinet positions, including Secretary of State. Another influential New Yorker of Caribbean ancestry, Colin Powell, also held the position of Secretary of State in more recent times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it relates to my district, I must mention the late, great Caribbean American of Barbadian and Guyanese  ancestry, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who worked in the Congress from 1969 to 1983 and was the first black woman to run for President of our Nation. Ms. Chisholm paved the way for me to serve in this body, second in the line of succession in the same constituency that she once served.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As a Caribbean American woman and a Member of Congress, it's my hope that we can continue to improve our diplomatic and economic relationships and arrangements with many of our neighbors in the Caribbean region, such as Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and other Caribbean nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Caribbean communities, known as CARICOM, have worked with their citizen ambassadors in the American Caribbean diaspora to develop a diversified economy that is favorable to foreign direct investment from the United States and human resource and intellectual capital from the region. As such, the Caribbean nations have cooperated on tax enforcement matters, transparency and exchange for information with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These Caribbean nations are also strategic partners and assist the United States' counter transnational terrorism activities, crime and illegal narcotics importation. These contributions and importance of the Caribbean region to the United States is reflected in the millions of people who contribute to acknowledge the pride heritage of the region by way of the Caribbean Carnival styled parades and festivities that occur across this Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. And I want to commend my colleague, Representative Barbara Lee, for its introduction. I also want to commend the Caribbean community, not only in my city of Chicago, which has a large population--as a matter of fact, we just finished celebrating the Festival of the Arts, which is a large celebration recognized by many people throughout the Midwest as a place to be--but we've heard accolades extended to  individuals who have been great states persons, individuals who have been businesspeople and academicians. Every kind of person that you can think of has some heritage from the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think that we don't have to look far when we think of our own colleagues that we interact with every day. And so I commend them for being a part of the American population, but of the African-Caribbean diaspora. And I commend again Representative Barbara Lee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="364">H. Con. Res. 364</bill>, which recognizes the significance of National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I am proud to have joined my friend, Congresswoman Barbara Lee in sponsoring this resolution once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker the term "Heritage" is the amalgamation of things that make us who we are and where we are, as individuals, the people we are and, in this case, the nation we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During "Caribbean American Heritage Month," we celebrate the great contributions of Caribbean Americans to the framework of the United States of America. This celebration should mark an accolade to the common culture and liaison that create the unity between the United States and the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Caribbean American Heritage Month" marks our appreciation for the many ways in which Caribbean Americans have contributed to our great Nation. We may look as far back as the period of 1900 to 1920 which marked the initiation of mass labor migration from the Caribbean to the United States and the formation of the first large Caribbean communities in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us not forget World War I when the recruitment of labor from the Caribbean became imperative. These laborers atoned for the reduced number of the European immigrants to the United States. More than 100,000 Caribbean laborers were recruited for agricultural and tedious jobs as part of war labors. Some of them were men and women who fought for our country upon being granted citizenship. We should acknowledge the Caribbean American men and women who served our country and those who continue  to serve this nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at the history of the Caribbean Americans, we see the enormity of their contribution to our Nation. Likewise, we see the similarity in the senses that just like America; the countries of the Caribbean faced slavery and were colonized. We now have millions of people who have emigrated from the Caribbean to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should acknowledge the enrichment that they have contributed to the United States. The uniqueness in their culture has helped in diversifying and shaping America; thus, pulsating our States, cities and towns. The countries of the Caribbean have also played a role in the economic growth of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a daughter of the Caribbean myself, I also honor the contributions of Virgin Islanders such as D. Hamilton Jackson, a famous laborer; Alexander Hamilton, one of our Nation's Founding Fathers and raised on the island of St. Croix; and Frank Rudolph Crosswaith, who created the Trade Union Committee for Organizing Negro Workers, the Negro Labor Committee and became a founding member of the anti-Communist Union for Democratic Action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These and several other factors should be reflected during the Caribbean American Heritage Month. Let us honor, value and show gratitude to those who contribute in making us the nation that we are.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee for bringing recognition to a group often forgotten in this racial and ethnic melting pot known as America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation does more than recognize Caribbean-Americans or as many are called West Indians, it recognizes and celebrates diversity. Unfortunately, this country has not always celebrated its diverse roots. It has faltered at times in remembering that the differences can be celebrated as much as those things in which we share--like humanity, like faith in a higher power, like democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even now as I stand and address the House floor, I am reminded that we have yet to pass comprehensive immigration reform. We still watch the television and see commercials using words like illegal and alien, with people that are from our southern borders of Mexico or our coastal south like Haiti or Cuba. Sadly, these commercials prey on the fears of an America in an economic crisis. These commercials speak to fear of other cultures, other religions, and other ways of doing business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What they do not show is the thousands upon thousands of new immigrants who make their home here and work from sun up to sun down to build a better tomorrow for their families. What the commercials do not speak to is the thousands of immigrants who come from our northern borders or from Europe. More importantly, these commercials do not speak to the foundation of one land made up of many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution reminds us that although many in this country were born elsewhere or have parents who were born elsewhere they are very much Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congresswoman Lee, for reminding us to celebrate our diverse population by celebrating Caribbean-Americans. Each Caribbean country has shared her native children with these United States. From the classic actor and activist Sidney Poitier to the former Army general and Secretary of State Colin Powell, from the charismatic Celia Cruz to the hard-rocker Lenny Kravitz, and so many more--Caribbean-Americans honor both their past and their present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the Members on this very bill have parents or grandparents from the West Indies. Thank you for celebrating them and for celebrating what makes America beautiful--her diverse people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank all of those who strive to see an America made up of a diverse group of people. Many of them have given up not only their country of birth but their loved ones, to cross into an unknown land to build a dream. Let their love for America not be doubted because they also celebrate their native Jamaica or Bahamas or Dominican Republic or Trinidad--let it be a lesson that you can love your past, while you celebrate your future. I urge my colleagues to support a resolution  that is about the celebration of diversity.</paragraph>
