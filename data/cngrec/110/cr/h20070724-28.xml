    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, many American families will finally receive a long overdue pay raise when phase one of the Federal minimum wage increase takes effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been 10 long years since American workers have seen an increase in the Federal minimum wage, the longest gap in the history of the law. Over that decade, inflation has all but erased the effect of the last increase, leaving millions of families, including military families, struggling to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, Madam Speaker, 10 percent of military spouses earn between $5.15 and $7.25 an hour. These 50,000 military families are part of the nearly 13 million Americans who will benefit from the Federal minimum wage increase that takes effect today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, increasing the minimum wage is just one part of a broader American agenda to strengthen the economy and help working families. Democrats believe that all Americans, not just the privileged few, deserve to make a living wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that we passed this legislation, and especially glad that it will help so many of our military families.</paragraph>
