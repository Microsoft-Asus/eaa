  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Last night we heard a vision that the President of the United States was standing in the Chamber of the House of Representatives speaking to all of us. He talked about how best to proceed during times of clear economic crisis, job loss, health care, energy costs soaring, threats to our domestic safety nets, and a war in Iraq with no end in sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When news media people asked me what I thought about the speech, one of the things I said was I wished the President could have sat in on some of the meetings that I had as I traveled Ohio in the last year, my State. I had about 80 roundtable meetings of 15, 20, 25 people in a community where for an hour and a half I would ask them questions about their communities, about their problems. In every corner of the State, I heard from veterans and first responders, from farmers, from people running  small businesses, from teachers, from students, from community leaders, from mothers and fathers. I wish the President had been able to hear some of this because people clearly want to hear their Government is finally committed to change and to fighting for the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They want to hear that the economic policies of the last 7 years, policies that have failed them, are a thing of the past and we have a new direction. They want to hear about a plan to finally bring back good-paying jobs, lower our health care and energy coasts, secure our safety nets, and end the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Ohioans, the future is about change. Let's say you are driving down the road. You notice that the signs, mile markers, exit signs, billboards as huge as houses are telling you that you are going in the wrong direction: Signs saying wages stagnating, signs saying U.S. jobs being shipped overseas, a housing crisis deepening, health care costs soaring, increased dependance on foreign oil, product safety unsure, no end to the war in Iraq. The longer you stay on the road, the worse things get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you hit the gas pedal and head further down that road. If you drive down the road, the wrong road, long enough, does it become the right one? Of course not. You do not proudly log more miles on the wrong road. You change direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is one thing you can say about the administration and its supporters in Congress it is that they are consistent. They consistently answer to the wealthiest Americans and to the largest corporations and pay lipservice to the rest of the population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about last night. The President said 116 million people--if we extend the tax cuts, 116 million people will get tax cuts averaging $1,800 a person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the President really say--does that really say what the tax cuts mean? It is a very small number of people getting huge tax cuts, and tens and tens and tens of millions of Americans are getting almost nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does he say it that way? Does he tell the American people that is what it is? Of course not. He says the average American will average $1,800 from the tax cuts. Simply, that is very misleading. We have seen that on tax policy over and over and over in this administration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield to the Senator.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was going to inquire of the Senator from Ohio if he found, as I did last night, it very unusual to have the entire State of the Union Address talking about the economic difficulties in our country and the need for a stimulus plan and so on without ever mentioning the real root causes at all of what has put us in this position: For example, a $700 billion, going to an $800 billion-a-year trade deficit; a fiscal policy budget deficit that is going to require us to borrow</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, the fact is, everyone in the world, including American citizens, look at that and understand that is so far off the track there is no way that works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support a stimulus package. I think it is fine to do for psychological purposes. But I am wondering if the Senator from Ohio wonders, as I do, why the President does not even seem to recognize the underlying causes of the economic difficulty in our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the comments from the Senator from North Dakota, who understands probably better than anybody in this body what this trade deficit means, what this trade policy means. And what is amazing is the President does not look at the $800 billion trade deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to the Congress in 1992, it was $38 billion. Now it is over $800 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's father once said $1 billion in trade deficits translates into the loss of 13,000 jobs. Now it is $800 billion, and the President did not address that. But what he did say is: Let's do more of this. He said: We need a trade agreement with Columbia, we need a trade agreement with Panama, we need a trade agreement with South Korea. And it just makes me incredulous that the President cannot look at what has happened and say: Wait a second, let's do a timeout. Let's do no further trade  agreements. Let's go back, as the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, has suggested, and let's have benchmarks. Let's look at what NAFTA did to our country, look at what CAFTA has done to our country, look at what trade with China has done to the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President totally missed that. At the same time, the President said: Let's do more tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent at the expense of the middle class and drive up these budget deficits. So we have trade deficits of $800 billion, plus we have budget deficits of about $1 billion a day. And that is fundamentally the biggest problem with our economy, as you suggest.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>I agree with that analysis. I sat in that Chamber last evening. A joint session is always a wonderful privilege, to hear the President give the State of the Union Address. I was thinking, everyone is sitting here in dark suits and pretty well dressed up for a big occasion. Not one person in that Chamber is going to have their job lost because it was shipped overseas someplace in search of cheap labor. Nobody in this Chamber, nobody in the Senate has ever lost their job because somebody  decided to outsource it to China for 30 cents an hour labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of working people have to come home at the end of the day and say: Honey, I was given notice today. I lost my job because they found somebody halfway around the world who will do it for 20 cents an hour. They told me I can't compete with that. Our family can't live on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just talking about the trade piece of this, the President completely ignores that. There ought to be a summit meeting at this point, if you have $1.3 trillion of red ink in 1 year. They say the budget deficit is only $300 billion, $275 billion. It is not. Take a look at the budget policy and find out how much we are going to increase the debt in this year. The debt is going to increase by $600 billion on the budget side and $700 to $800 billion on the trade side. That is $1.3 trillion off the  track in one single year, 10 percent of our economic output. The fact is, that is unsustainable and is going to run this country's economy into a ditch. If we are going fix it, we have to diagnose it. This President hasn't come close to even acknowledging the difficulty</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the Senator from Ohio agree that these are the underlying causes of concern about this economy?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Absolutely. I remember back in the early 1990s, we were concerned about the twin deficits, the trade deficit and the budget deficit. We had a budget deficit then of about $300 billion a year and a trade deficit, as the Presiding Officer knows--who joined me in voting against NAFTA a decade ago--of under $100 billion. We considered that a serious problem. Today, President Bush doesn't recognize that this trade deficit means anything. To the contrary, he says, it seems to be working.  Let's do more of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I go back to what his father said, that a billion dollars in trade deficit translates into 13,000 lost jobs. You can see how it does. Because a billion dollars in trade deficit means we are buying a billion dollars, we are importing a billion dollars more than we are selling, and that means we are manufacturing less because we are not making it ourselves. If we manufacture less, it means thousands of Ohioans or North Dakotans or New Jerseyans are finding they are not working at $12 or</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>The fact is, it is not something I enjoy doing, to talk about the difficulties. I would like to talk about the opportunities for this country. We will not get to the opportunities until we decide we are going to start taking care of some things here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This President, in this past fiscal year, the one we are in right now, sent us a request for $196 billion of emergency money and said: I want it put on top of the debt. Don't pay for it. Add it to the debt. That is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week for Iraq and Afghanistan, to replenish the military accounts for that purpose. Now we are told he is going to send another $70 billion on top of that. That takes us to close to three-quarters of a trillion that will have been spent, none of it  paid for, all of it requested by this President as an emergency so it didn't have to be paid for. You look at that and you say to yourself: We have so much that needs doing, including not just on the budget side getting our act together but on the trade side, standing up for our country's interests, demanding fair trade, and, on the investment side, investing in infrastructure, all these things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night it was almost as if the President was oblivious to the fundamental causes of the economic difficulty. This is a great economic engine we have, but the fact is, it needs some work. It doesn't need somebody to polish it with a rag and hum a nice tune. It needs real work to get this engine going again. The American people are innovative, great workers. It is an inspired country in which we live. That is why we have progressed the way we have over 200 years. But the American people need  something to work with. We need to invest in working people. We need to have faith in working people. Instead what we have done is pulled the rug out from under working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have used so many examples in the Senate, and my friend from Ohio knows all of them because a good number of them come from the State of Ohio, Huffy bicycles and Etch A Sketch and so many examples, all those jobs now in China that used to be in Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my favorites is to talk about Fig Newton cookies. The National Biscuit Company, NABISCO, took Fig Newton cookies from New Jersey to Mexico. Why? They could find somebody who would shovel fig paste apparently at a much lower cost than it cost to pay somebody to shovel fig paste in New Jersey. If you want to buy some Mexican food, buy Fig Newton cookies, made in Mexico, still called the National Biscuit Company, except it isn't so national anymore. Now they are made in Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is one example of a hundred, a thousand, a million we could give and have. It is the question of whether this country is going to stand up for its workers and whether we are going to have the courage not just to stand up for workers in fair trade agreements but whether we are also going to put on track fiscal policy, trade policy, regulatory authority in a way that gives people confidence about the future of this economy and jobs and opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>When I hear Senator Dorgan talk about this, I think about 20 years from now, 15 years from now. We are going to look back on this time, and we will think: What were they thinking when they changed the laws to allow so many cheap imports from  China, made by workers in unsafe conditions, sending products back, toxic toys to our children's bedrooms and contaminated food into our kitchens  and pantries? We are going to look back 20 years from now and think: Why did we dismantle our industrial base, jeopardizing our national security, the security of our family farms in North Dakota and Ohio and small businesses and manufacturers in New Jersey and all over the country? We are going to look back and think: Why did we let corporations lobby this Congress so that they changed the rules so that it made sense for these companies, in terms of their bottom line, in terms of their profits,  to go to China instead of manufacturing in Galion or Toledo or Youngstown, OH?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine instead if we as a nation decided we were going to have a Marshall plan or go to the Moon kind of plan on alternative energy, that we changed our trade law and our tax law and we began through biomass, through production of wind turbines and solar panels. Imagine if we set out to remake our energy policy and our country's industrial base by changing trade law, by changing tax law. We clearly still do the best R&amp;D in the world on all kinds of scientific research and medical research. But  so often we do the R&amp;D here, which is good for the economy and good for creating jobs, but then most of the production is shipped offshore. So what good is that for our country, when we develop the research, we do the research and development and then send it offshore?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator mentioned the Ohio Art Company. That sort of tells the story. It is a company in northwest Ohio right in the corner where Indiana and Ohio intersect with Michigan. They make something that most of us knew as children called Etch A Sketch. About 7 or 8 years ago--I was in Bryan a couple months ago talking to an executive of Ohio Art Company. Seven or eight years ago a major U.S. retailer went to them and said: We want to sell your product in our stores for less money, for under $10.  The only option that Ohio Art Company had was to stop most of its production in Ohio and move its production overseas. Every job that was moved to China meant less money for the Bryan Police Department, less money for the Williams County government, less money for public schools, less money paid into Medicare,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Dorgan and I want more trade but a different set of rules. Instead of lifting workers up so Mexican workers would be buying American products and we would be buying Mexican products back and forth the way we should trade, and their living standards would go up, they would have good environmental and worker safety standards, their wages would rise. That is what happened with the 50 States in the United States. As companies moved around the United States to the South, eventually  their wages went up and we began to enrich all sections of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not doing that with China. We are not doing that with our trade policy. That is why I was so disappointed that last night the President said: We want a new trade agreement with Colombia. We want one with South Korea. We want one with Panama. Instead of going in the right direction, we are changing our trade policy and moving in a different direction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator and I are working on a piece of legislation we intend to introduce that would establish benchmarks for trade agreements. We had a $1.5 billion trade surplus with Mexico. We did a trade agreement. Guess what. We turned that surplus into a huge deficit, a giant deficit, $60 billion to $70 billion a year. So we turned a surplus into a deficit, shipped a lot of U.S. jobs to Mexico. What we need is a trade agreement with benchmarks and accountability. Is this  trade agreement meeting the objectives we developed for our country? After all, we are stewards of our country. We want our country to do well. Yes, we want to lift others. We want to it be a more prosperous world. But first we want this country to do well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wouldn't it be the height of irony, an unbelievable perversion, if we passed a "stimulus package," and we borrow the money from China to put money in the hands of American families who can take it to Wal-Mart and buy a Radio Flyer little red wagon made in China. We borrow the money from China, give to it an American consumer who goes to Wal-Mart to buy a Chinese wagon. I say Radio Flyer because that is one of those great American brands. Almost every child in this country has hooked a ride  on a Radio Flyer, either theirs or their neighbor's. Do you know how Radio Flyer got its name? It was an immigrant who came to Chicago, IL, and decided to start trying to make some wagons. He made a few of them. Everybody liked them. He was a guy who came to our country and was so pleased with being able to come to our country. He liked two things. He loved airplanes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting that when we talk about this, some will listen and say: The guy from Ohio, the fellow from North Dakota, they don't get it. They are a bunch of xenophobic isolationist stooges who can't see over the horizon. It is a global economy. Get over it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a global economy. But the rules have not kept pace with galloping globalization. The result is pushing down standards in the United States, moving jobs from the United States overseas, a hemorrhaging trade deficit that is dangerous for our country's interests, $2 billion a day every day that we import more than we export. The largest export from the United States by volume is wastepaper to Asia. Think of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is simple. I appreciate the work the Senator from Ohio and others have done on this issue. We have to put this country on track. I am for trade and plenty of it. But I demand and insist that we stand up for this country's interests and demand fair trade. We have to bring this trade deficit down. That is putting dramatic amounts of money in the hands of the Chinese and Japanese and others. Don't be surprised when you open the paper to find out what they have purchased next, one of our  major investment banking companies, you name it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We to have fix this. I know the Senator from Ohio came here with a statement and I interrupted him, but what I wanted to do was to say, I was very surprised last night to sit in the State of the Union Address and hear talk about a stimulus and hear talk about the economy and not even hear one whisper about the real vulnerabilities of this economy--a trade deficit out of control, reckless fiscal policy, combined with adding $1.3 trillion in debt, 10 percent of the GDP in 1 year, and then  regulators asleep and apparently applauded for being asleep, while we have unregulated hedge funds, leveraged transactions, $43 trillion of notional value, something most people can't understand, notional value, credit default swaps. Sounds like a foreign language. There is $43 trillion of notional value out there in credit default swaps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a totally unregulated hedge fund industry with derivatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of things we need to care about and we need to fix. The Senator from Ohio is absolutely right in talking about it on the floor of the Senate tonight. I deeply appreciate his willingness to let me interrupt him for a couple minutes because these are very important issues for our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. He told the story about the immigrant who settled in Chicago. That may have been a story from a different era, but we still in so many ways are a nation of tinkerers and inventors, entrepreneurs and scientists--a nation that still leads the world in brain power in terms of figuring out new products, new ways of doing things, new services. The problem is, there has been a disconnect between that and production and job growth and  job creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the President's speech last night, to me, was so disappointing,  that he has asked for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, tax cuts that, frankly--usually, these tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans are at the expense of the middle class. He has asked for more trade agreements while our trade deficit explodes year after year after year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Dorgan suggested, we know what we need to do as a nation. We know what we need to do with tax policy to serve the middle class. We know what we need to do with trade policy to serve the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though the President wants to stay the course, wants to continue the same direction, I think there is change afoot in this country. People want change. People want to strengthen again the middle class and strengthen our communities in New Jersey and Rhode Island--Senator Whitehouse is in the Chamber, too--and in my State of Ohio, from Lima to Zanesville and from Dayton to Warren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you, Mr. President, for your time and again exhort Americans to look down the road for a new trade policy, a new tax policy that helps to build the middle class.</paragraph>
