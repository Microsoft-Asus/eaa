    <paragraph>Under sections 211, 301(b), and 320(a), of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record a revision to the budget allocations and aggregates for certain House committees for fiscal years 2007, 2008, and the period of 2008 through 2012. This revision represents an adjustment to certain House committee budget allocations and aggregates for the purposes of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974, as amended, and in response to the bill <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill> made in order by the Committee on Rules (Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007). Corresponding tables are attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under section 211 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, this adjustment to the budget allocations and aggregates applies while the measure is under consideration. The adjustments will take effect upon enactment of the measure. For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, a revised allocation made under section 211 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> is to be considered as an allocation included in the resolution.</paragraph>
