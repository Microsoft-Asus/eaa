  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we pass lots of laws in the Congress of the United States, and from time to time there is a byproduct of the passage of some of those laws. It is called the law of unintended consequences. Such is the case with the Endangered Species Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Georgia, we are in a level 4, 100-year drought. As many as 7 million citizens in my State are looking at the possibility of there being no drinking water in less than 120 days. Our State has imposed restrictions of every kind. Landscapers are out of business, car washes are threatened, and there is no outdoor watering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home county of Cobb, in the last 14 days, has reduced, through conservation, water consumption by 20 percent.  I personally commend commission chairman Sam Owens and the entire North Georgia Water Planning District for everything they are doing. But in the absence of rain, there is nothing we can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why does this affect the Endangered Species Act? Very simply because a court case was filed a few years ago under the Endangered Species Act asking for the management of the Chattahoochee River basin to be controlled so as to protect sturgeon. The judge in that case finally ruled as much and developed the judge's own interim operating plan for the Chattahoochee River. That plan means the Corps of Engineers makes releases to keep the flow in the Chattahoochee River where the sturgeon exist at  a level sufficient to sustain the sturgeon. The problem is the level is insufficient to sustain human life in North Georgia if it continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, just a few minutes ago, on behalf of myself and Senator Chambliss, I introduced an amendment to the Endangered Species Act to deal with this law of unintended consequences. It very simply says the following: The head of the Army Corps of Engineers or the Governor of a State, within which a region lies where there is a drought that threatens the health, safety, and welfare of the people in that region, may suspend the course and effect of the Endangered Species Act until  that endangerment has passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a simple request. We are at a place in time in our country and in a region, my home region, the State I represent, where the health, safety, and welfare of my people are threatened. They are threatened by an act this Congress passed that had no intention to threaten them. If we have the power to do that, we also have the power to make the exception to see to it that their drinking water is safe and their livelihood is safe and at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a critical, critical emergency. It is time sensitive. I urge each Member of the Senate to follow this simple amendment and this simple proposal and think about what they might do if it was their State, if it was their people. It is time we gave the Army Corps the latitude and the Governors of the States the authority to protect our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stood in this Chamber 3 years ago and raised my right hand and agreed to defend the Constitution of the United States and protect the domestic tranquility from enemies foreign and domestic. Today I stand recognizing there is a domestic enemy, and that enemy is the Endangered Species Act which controls the Chattahoochee River and limits access to drinking water and safe water for the people of north Georgia. I urge Members of the Senate to join myself and Senator Chambliss in this critical  and important amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Isakson from Georgia, in support of this legislation. Georgia is in a critical time in the history of our State. Atlanta, GA, is a great place to live, a great place to work, a great place to visit, but we are in a crisis. The water supply system for metropolitan Atlanta depends on two basins, Lake Altoona and Lake Lanier. Lake Altoona and Lake Lanier are fed by nature, by rainfall that every year, thus far in the history of  those basins, has filled those basins since they were built decades ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, during the month of August, we received very little moisture. But at the time we were receiving very little moisture, we had more 100-degree day temperatures than we have ever had in the history of Atlanta. A combination of natural forces has put us in this situation of crisis, but there is also an unnatural source that has helped produce this crisis, and the legislation that Senator Isakson has proposed, along with my cosponsorship, seeks to address this critical problem  and seeks to help find a solution to this problem for the short term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgia's lakes are low and continue to decline as the Army Corps of Engineers releases water to protect a handful of sturgeons and mussels in the Appalachicola Bay in the State of Florida. Understandably, folks who have had mandatory water restrictions for months in our State, who are watching these lakes slowly decrease, are wondering where the common sense in Washington has gone. They are calling my office and asking: How can our Government care more about mussels and sturgeons than human  beings? Obviously, that is not the case. But water continues to be released, and estimates are that Lake Lanier, Atlanta's main source of water, will be empty--and I repeat, will be empty--by January 2008 if the Corps does not stop releasing so much water or if we do not get rainfall. That is less than 3 months away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that we are in a crisis. We need to do something to ensure we are not cutting off the drinking supply to 7 million people in the metropolitan Atlanta area. This legislation does something very simple and practical to address this crisis in the short term. It says, if the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Governor of a State, determines that a drought is in effect in a region in which there is a Federal river basin that is managed by the Corps of Engineers, and the drought  threatens the health, safety, and welfare of the human population in that region, the Secretary of the Army can temporarily suspend provisions of the Endangered Species Act until such time as the drought is over and the health, safety, and welfare of humans is no longer at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have larger issues to address in the long term. Updating the water control manuals by which the Corps of Engineers operates the river basins in Georgia and getting the Governors of our neighboring States together to apportion the water among the States for the long term are critical issues that have to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As resources get scarce, these things become more difficult to accomplish. Unfortunately, the people of Georgia cannot wait. They need immediate relief, and swift  passage of this legislation will certainly help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
