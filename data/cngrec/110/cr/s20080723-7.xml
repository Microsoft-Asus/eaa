    <paragraph>Mr. President, the House is going to vote, probably sometime shortly after lunchtime today, on the comprehensive housing legislation. I have spoken during the last month or so to Secretary Paulson several times. Each call he places to me--I don't call him, even though I feel comfortable in calling him--is because he is very concerned about what is going on with the American economy. He recognizes that there are deep problems, but one of the problems is housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People understand more every day that it is more than just the person losing their home that is a concern to us with foreclosures. There are 8,500 new foreclosure notices every day. It is more than just that person or that family in that home. It affects the neighborhood. It affects the government entity where the home is located  because their taxes are no longer coming in.

    <paragraph>I am happy to report to everyone that the Bush administration has reversed its veto threat on this legislation. That is really good news for the American people. But we still see, even in today's press, there are some Republican Senators threatening to delay and possibly try to derail this legislation. I have had conversations with Senator McConnell, and I don't think it can be derailed. They can slow it down a little bit. We are going to do everything we can--I am confident that is  the case--Senator McConnell and I, to get this done just as quickly as we can. I hope we can finish it today. That would be great, if it could go to the President today, because now that President Bush has joined our call to pass this crucial legislation into law, I would hope those few stragglers who</paragraph>
