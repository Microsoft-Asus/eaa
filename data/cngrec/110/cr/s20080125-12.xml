    <paragraph>Mr. President, just one further observation with regard to my friend's remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bond-Rockefeller bill is exactly the way we ought to be doing our business. It came out of the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2. It is supported on a bipartisan basis. It is supported by the President of the United States. We have a product that was carefully negotiated by Senator Bond and Senator Rockefeller, approved by the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2, and supported by the President of the United States. That is my definition of a bipartisan accomplishment. Now the question  is, Can we finish the job and get a signature?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not about frightening the American people. The American people should be frightened, and remember full well what happened on 9/11. They also remember with gratitude that it has not happened again for 6 years. The reason for it, obviously, is we have been on offense, going after the terrorists where they are, and we have improved our defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An integral part of protecting the homeland is the measure before us, carefully crafted on a bipartisan basis, supported by the President of the United States. If we want to finish the job and have a bipartisan accomplishment that all of us can be proud of, the way to do that is to pass this bill, send it to the House, urge them to take it up and pass it, and send it to the President, who awaits it to affix his signature.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is no question that Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond have worked hard on this legislation. Also, we have had good work from Senator Leahy and Senator Specter of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Rockefeller wants a piece of legislation to pass very badly. He does not support cloture in this effort that is going to take place on Monday because he believes the bill needs to be changed. Just because there is a bill that  comes out of committee doesn't mean we shouldn't deal with it here on the floor. Senator Rockefeller is not going to support cloture on this bill on Monday. It is a decision he made, and he has made it because we have not had the opportunity to do things to this piece of legislation that he believes should happen. It is a rare piece of legislation that comes out of one of these major committees that comes to the floor that doesn't require some improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is simply unfair to say that Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond's piece of legislation should go through as if it were written in script on top of some big mountain. It was written in a committee room with a lot of discussion and votes, and some of the amendments passed, some didn't. It came to the floor. We all are happy it came to the floor. But at this time, even Senator Rockefeller believes there should be changes in it, and he will not support cloture,  as he told me last night, because he feels it has been handled so poorly by the minority here on the floor.</paragraph>
