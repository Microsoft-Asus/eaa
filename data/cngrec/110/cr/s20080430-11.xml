    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is the 33rd anniversary of the fall of South Vietnam, where the North Vietnamese offensive that had begun in the aftermath of a vote in this Congress to cut off supplemental funding to the Government of South Vietnam. This was combined with a massive refurbishment of the North Vietnamese Army that allowed an invasion to kick off at a time when our South Vietnamese allies were attempting to reorganize their positions in order to adapt to the reality that they were  going to get markedly less funding from the United States in their effort to grow their incipient democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important for us to look back on that event and to give credit where credit is due, and also to talk a little bit about the future of relations between our country and the present Government in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often in today's school systems and in the discussions that examine the Vietnam war, we are overwhelmed by mythology. In many cases, we tend to assume this was a war between the United States and Vietnam. Nothing could be further from the truth. This was an attempt by the United States to assist a government in the south that had been formed with the idea that it would evolve into a properly functioning democracy, in the same way that we assisted South Korea when it was divided from North  Korea, in the same way that we very successfully assisted West Germany when the demarcation line at the end of World War II divided Germany between the Communist east and the free society in the west. We were not successful in that endeavor in Vietnam for a number of reasons. But it would be wrong to assume that this was an action by our country against the country of Vietnam. It was an attempt to actually assist that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of talk about the domino theory and the heightened and unjustified warnings about what was going on in the rest of the region with respect to different efforts that were backed by the Soviet Union and Communist China at that point. But these were actually valid concerns at the time. Indonesia had suffered an attempted coup that was sponsored by the Chinese. We had a hot war in South Korea when North Korea invaded. This was a region in a great deal of turmoil, when you look back  at the European powers that had colonies throughout Southeast Asia, which had largely pulled back after World War II because of the enormous costs of that war. It had shrunk back into their own national perimeters. The Japanese had colonized a good part of Southeast Asia, and after World War II they had withdrawn their forces. There was a good deal of turbulence, and there was a great deal of strategic justification for what we attempted to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is 58,000 Americans were killed in action or died of hostile causes during the Vietnam war. We should remember them with the validity that their effort deserves. Mr. President, 245,000 South Vietnamese soldiers fought alongside us and perished; 1.4 million Communist soldiers died in that endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The events following the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, have never really been given the proper attention in terms of how we evaluate the history of what we attempted to do. One million of the cream of South Vietnam's leaders were sent into reeducation camps, and 240,000 of them remained in those camps for 4 years or longer; 56,000 of them died in the reeducation camps. This was the cream of South Vietnam's leadership--almost as many as we lost in the entire war. Two million Vietnamese were  displaced, a million of them hitting the ocean, risking their  lives in order to try to reach a better life that would not be under the oppression of a government that had succeeded in conquering the south. Many of them came to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the families whose fathers and, in some cases, mothers had been in reeducation camps were able to relocate here and begin a different life. A Stalinist system took over in the north. When I started going back to Vietnam in 1991, that system was very much in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should look to the future. I believe there are two important things for us to keep in mind at this point in the evolution of our relations with Vietnam. First is that over a pretty rocky period of time, the Communist Government of Vietnam has made adjustments and positive contributions. This is not to say that we are in a perfectly beneficial relationship, but I have been pleased, since 1991, to participate in many of these endeavors to bring a more moderate society inside Vietnam and to assist  in bringing in American businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vietnam and Thailand, in my view, are two of the most important countries in terms of how the United States should be looking at East Asia and Southeast Asia with the emergence of China, the emergence of India, and the evolution of Muslim fundamentalism that spills over in Southeast Asia into countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the south Philippines. Vietnam and Thailand are very important to us, and the relationships evolving between Vietnam and the United States are healthy and in the  long term are going to be successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing we should remember is that there are many Vietnamese Americans in this country who suffered not only during the war, but after 1975. We tend to forget that with the reorganization of the society that occurred under Communist rule. I have spent a good bit of my life working to assist this refugee community in the United States. I also have been working to build a bridge between the overseas Vietnamese community and the ruling Government in Vietnam today. Through that bridge, we  are going to have a much healthier society here and also a much more productive society in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I wanted to do my small part in making sure we in this country remember not only a struggle that had a great deal of validity to it--even though it did not turn out the way many of us wanted it to--but also the positive aspects of our relations with Vietnam looking into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
