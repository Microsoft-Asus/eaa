  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Chamber for its indulgence in allowing us to bring before it today the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2008, which is a reauthorization and improvement upon the existing section 811 supportive housing statute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I go into very briefly the details and importance of this act, I would just like to thank those that have worked on this bill and this issue, including the chairman of the committee, Chairman Frank, the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Housing, Representative Waters, and especially the Republican cosponsor of this legislation, along with myself, Representative Biggert, who has been just a boundless champion for the issue of supportive housing, the issue of compassionate  care for those individuals with physical and mental disabilities, and also to Mrs. Capito, who has led this committee and this issue so ably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the 811 program today is the Nation's primary program for funding supportive housing. What is supportive housing? Supportive housing is housing for people with largely mental disability or physical disability, that provides some basic supports around those living arrangements so that those individuals can live independently. Job skills, medication adherence, social work, a small amount of support given to these individuals living with these disabilities can make sure that those individuals  can live on their own independently and live full and productive lives. It is a cost-effective and compassionate program that, unfortunately, has not worked as well as it should have in the past several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates, Mr. Speaker, that 1.3 million individuals, non-elderly disabled across this country, are low income, living in substandard housing; 1.3 million people, and our 811 program simply hasn't reached enough of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, less than 1,000 new units were built around this country with 811 dollars, and, as we heard before the subcommittee, it has taken sometimes 6 years for projects funded with 811 capital dollars to go from the development stage to the completion stage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's an unacceptably long amount of time for projects that sometimes only encompass four or six or eight units of housing. This bill sets a, I think, very aggressive but reasonable goal, a tripling over time the number of units constructed in this country with 811 dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How does it do this? Primarily it does this by taking the $87 million right now that are used as vouchers in the 811 program, and transferring those vouchers over to the larger section 8 program. What we have learned is that these vouchers that are supposed to be dedicated to people with disabilities have not been traced sufficiently, and in fact, probably are going to people without disabilities, in many cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The section 8 program will do, I think, a much better job, is much better equipped to track those vouchers going forward. We then take that money that has now been freed up through the transition of those vouchers to the section 8 program and use  much of it to fund a new demonstration program that will seek to leverage the capital dollars from coming from the 811 program with low-income tax credits, private dollars and State partnerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By doing that, we will be able to take existing, affordable housing projects that are in the planning stages and, with small amounts of rental subsidies, be able to reach out to those developers and essentially make them a deal that we will give them a small rental subsidy if, in exchange, they carve out a small number of units to be supportive housing. This has worked remarkably well in States that have endeavored this program already. North Carolina comes to mind most immediately where, over  the last 7 years, 1,200 units of supportive housing have been built, in part, with this strategy put in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of other important improvements to the 811 program in this act, allowing States and State housing agencies to do much of the bureaucratic paperwork involved in these applications, which we believe will greatly expedite the application process, a study which will look into how we can better use dollars in existing housing projects, 202 housing projects, and other affordable housing projects, to get tenants that are living in other affordable housing sites, some basic support  services that will help them live independently. It is a vast improvement over the current law, and we hope, as I said, it will potentially triple the number of units built across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important. These are some of the country's most vulnerable citizens, who are playing by the rules, doing everything we ask, but simply need a small apartment of help to be able to live independent, productive lives in their community. This is one of the most compassionate things that this Congress can do is to try to extend out that basic building block of society, good, affordable housing to individuals with mental disability, with mental illness and with physical disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One last note, this bill is entitled the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act, and it is titled after the late Frank Melville, the founder, along with his wife, Ellen, of the Melville Charitable Trust. This charitable trust that they have built up through their generosity, the Melville family's generosity, has funded housing advocacy and specifically supportive housing advocacy across this country for a number of years. We would not have the housing advocacy community that exists  today if it weren't for the generosity of the Melvilles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this world lost Frank Melville, who also happened to be a constituent of mine, recently, and this act, I think, is a very appropriate testament to the work that he has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank, again, Mrs. Biggert for her great work over the years on this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>ILLNESS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arlington, VA, September 16, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: On behalf of the 210,000 members and 1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), I am writing to offer our strong support for the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2008 (<bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill>). As the Nation's largest organization representing people with serious mental illness and their families, NAMI is especially grateful to Chairman Barney Frank and the bill's sponsors, Representatives Chris Murphy and Judy Biggert, for their leadership  in moving this legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Section 811 is a critical affordable housing resource for non-elderly people with severe disabilities. While the program has been effective in developing permanent supportive housing, improvements are needed. <bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill> will streamline and simplify the existing process by which 811 sponsors compete for new projects. It will also reform Section 811 and create an important demonstration program to allow for investment of new capital resources from programs such as the Low-Income Housing  Tax Credit and HOME in supportive housing developments. Finally <bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill> would resolve the current threat to the program from the Section 811 "mainstream" voucher program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAMI applauds their commitment to improving supportive housing options for people with severe disabilities. Thank you for bringing this legislation to the full House. NAMI urges all members to support passage of <bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MICHAEL J. FITZPATRICK,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to rise today as the cosponsor of this legislation, and I certainly urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my good friend, Congressman Murphy, who introduced the bill, the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2008, and thank him for his hard work to modernize the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD's section 811 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 4 years, this administration has proposed deep cuts to the section 811 program. In response, for the past 4 years we have sent letters to the Appropriations Committee leaders urging them to reject those cuts and fully fund the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Because section 811 is the only Federal program that funds housing and vouchers for people with disabilities who seek to live as independent members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to report that for the last 4 years, Congress has agreed to fully fund this important program. This year, we are going beyond the appropriations. We are seeking to modernize the program, which hasn't been updated for over 15 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill> is critical to the goal of increasing the number of affordable units for people with disabilities. By better aligning this section 811 program with other Federal, State and local funding resources, it allows nonprofit sponsors to more easily leverage additional financing, thereby maximizing Federal dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By requiring HUD to simplify its more than 400 pages of guidelines, it streamlines the program. In addition, it delegates grant authority to State and local housing authorities, which housing experts agree will make the program more efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill calls for a new demonstration project that is estimated to generate as many as 3,000 new units of housing for nonelderly people with disabilities. The bill we are considering today will make the program more user friendly and attractive to nonprofits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, I would like to once again thank my colleague from Connecticut, Congressman Murphy, for working on this bill. In addition, I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus, Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member Capito, as well as their staffs, for helping us with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, I cannot forget to thank one of my constituents from Tinley Park, Illinois, Tony Paulauski, the executive director of the Arc of Illinois, who testified before our committee about the need for these reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a similar note, I would also like to thank the wonderful people in Illinois that work for Trinity Services and Cornerstone Services, as well as all of those volunteers, parents and other members of the community who have reached out to express their support for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill that modernizes an important Federal housing program that hasn't been updated. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) for as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400249" topic="NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill>, the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2008. This is the only HUD permanent supportive housing program that is exclusively for people with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support this legislation, which will reform and strengthen section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. This bill will actually increase efficiency  and better serve eligible disabled persons and, importantly, I think, this bill will streamline the bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who have tried to assist disabled persons with their housing understand the hoops that one must go through. This bill, I think, through the great work of Congressman Murphy and others, has solved much of that. But there is much to be said about the improvements to the current rental assistance program and the system for disbursing capital advances, which actually create and maintain affordable units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this bill will require HUD to carry out an important competitive demonstration program to expand the supply of truly supportive housing. I am especially pleased that this bill also authorizes appropriations for that assistance under section 8 in fiscal year 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having grown up in public housing, I am probably more aware than most of the important role that public housing fills in terms of the needs of our disabled community. This is especially true for our disabled citizens, who have a greater need for housing and facilities that meet their particular disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support those most in need in our country by voting for this important bipartisan measure. I must say Mr. Murphy has been very gracious in recognizing everyone who has been involved here, but I must, in turn, I think, recognize his great involvement and great leadership here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all the families out there, like mine, who have disabled persons, and we recognize the challenges that they deal with every day on a regular basis, I just want to extend our thanks to Chris Murphy, the Congressman from Connecticut, for his great work on this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL">
    <paragraph>I would like to join in the chorus of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we have heard, the section 811 program provides housing assistance and supportive services for persons with disabilities. I have seen firsthand in my own district the good works that this program provides, and I am sure it is the same for members across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The timing of the passage of this legislation is especially significant, as the House just passed the Americans with Disabilities Act amendments earlier today. It is appropriate that we would now consider legislation to improve our housing programs for those with disabilities who choose to live independently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard a good review, I believe, of the program. We know that it allows persons with disabilities to live independently. I think that's important to emphasize the independent nature of the 811 program. It is also the only Federal program that is solely dedicated to very low-income folks with serious or long-term disabilities. Unfortunately, sometimes those are coupled together because you have a serious or long-term disability, which sometimes prevents you from working, and it puts you  into that low or very low-income bracket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked about some of the revisions, programatic issues and changes that have been made, terminating 811's Mainstream Tenant-Based Rental Assistance Program and transferring those vouchers to section 8, modernizing the Capital Advance Program, establishing a project rental assistance demonstration program and revising the definitions of "group home," "people with disabilities," "supportive housing for persons with disabilities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also in this bill, we repeal the authority of the Secretary to waive size limitations on group homes and individual living facilities. These improvements to the program will help provide a better life for individuals with disabilities and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ability to live independently with the assistance of supportive services is critical to improving the lives of the disabled and allowing them to be active participants in their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join in thanking Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus. I would like to particularly thank Mr. Murphy for his leadership on this issue and Mrs. Biggert for her leadership as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL">
    <paragraph>I thank Mrs. Capito and Mrs. Biggert for their leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just in closing, Mr. Speaker, although this bill will help scores of individuals with physical handicaps, I think, to myself, of how much help this is going to provide the millions of individuals across this country with mental illness that are struggling to live independently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years ago, when this country and States across this Nation made the decision, the right decision to close down the institutions that housed many of those individuals, we made a promise that we would find new housing, new opportunities for those individuals to live on their own in the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not lived up to that promise. In Connecticut, those of us that care about this issue often wear a button around the halls of the State legislature entitled "Keep the Promise." This legislation, I believe, is a step towards doing just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5772">H.R. 5772</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
