    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the finest and oldest logistics companies in the State of North Carolina. Holland Transfer Company in Statesville, North Carolina embodies the ethics of good business that separates great companies from the rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, Holland Transfer celebrates its 100th anniversary and its longstanding commitment to running a customer service-centered business. This company has transported goods and materials to North Carolina businesses since 1907 and is the oldest carrier in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 100 years since its founding, Holland has built a strong reputation as a company that its customers can depend on to provide high-quality service without having to worry about getting shortchanged. Not many companies reach such a 100-year benchmark. In fact, it is doubtful that when Holland Transfer Company began with a team of horses and a single wagon that its founder, S.R. Holland, envisioned a company that today is a major part of the Statesville community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Holland Transfer embodies Christian values as part of its company character. These values are an integral part of what has made Holland Transfer successful for 100 years. I wish this fine company and all its employees all the best and many more years of doing business the right way. It is businesses like Holland Transfer that make this country great.</paragraph>
