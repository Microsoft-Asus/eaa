  <narrative>BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14451]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is 324 days of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These two decorated Border Patrol agents, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11- and 12-year prison sentences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans began hearing oral arguments for the agents' appeal. During the hearing, one of the three judges on the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly, said, "It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this one got out of hand."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The judges in this appeal will need to examine why the judge allowed the smuggler to plead the fifth amendment despite his immunity agreement, and why the jury was not allowed to hear crucial evidence that the smuggler was a repeat offender. The judges will also need to look at why the prosecutor charged the agents under a statute that was intended for violent criminals carrying guns, not for law enforcement officers acting in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing can erase the suffering these agents have undergone and the months they have spent in prison in solitary confinement away from their families. However, a judgment in favor of Ramos and Compean in this appeal would be an important victory and the first act of justice these agents have seen since their arrest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the injustice of this case should not go unexamined. Last night, I hand-delivered a letter to JOHN CONYERS, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to request a hearing on this case. Chairman Conyers responded that he would carefully review my letter and my request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the eyes of the American people, the prosecution of these border agents was not justified. The comments by the appeals judge are justification enough for the House Judiciary Committee to review this case to determine exactly why this case got out of hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An unbiased review of this case by Attorney General Mukasey, a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee, and a Presidential pardon for these agents are all steps that can and should be taken to rectify this gross miscarriage of justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the family of these two border agents, Compean and Ramos, that we in Congress will not give up the fight for justice until their loved ones are at home.</paragraph>
