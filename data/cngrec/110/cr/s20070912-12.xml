  <narrative>9/11 REMEMBRANCES IN PENNSYLVANIA -- (Senate - September 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11496">S11496</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to do something that I had hoped to do yesterday but didn't have the opportunity in the midst of our hearings on Iraq and so much else going on. I don't want to miss the opportunity to commend so many people in Somerset County in Pennsylvania, who, on two occasions--Monday night and, of course, yesterday--were observing the 9/11 remembrances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of the Monday night event I attended at the Somerset Alliance Church in Somerset, PA, I wanted to commend them for so much. There are several groups--I will not mention names--such as the National Park Service, of course, that helped bring that event together, as well as doing so much other work at the crash site; the families of Flight 93, the Flight 93 Advisory Commission, the Flight 93 Memorial Task Force, and so many others too numerous to name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday night, the service I attended was a night of grief, a night of gratitude, and I think a night of renewal. There was grief in the obvious sense that we still grieve for those who perished heroically on September 11, 2001, at every site--in this case in Shanksville, Somerset County, PA. Certainly, it was a night to grieve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was also a night to express gratitude in two ways at least: One, gratitude for those who gave their lives heroically so that the plane crashed in Pennsylvania instead of coming here to destroy the Capitol or some other part of our Government, and where more lives might have been lost, as well as, I think, to express gratitude to those brave Americans on that plane, but also to express the gratitude of the people who came after that tragedy in Somerset County, where the families, in particular,  wanted to use this Monday night ceremony to thank the people of Somerset County. So many people have provided some measure of comfort over all these 6 years to the families who loved and lost. So I think it was also a night for gratitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it was a night to express our shared feeling of renewal, renewing not just our commitment to take care of those families and to do all we can to help them, but also our collective renewal to continue the fight for the ages--the fight against terrorism all across our country and across the world. So it was a night to renew our commitment to that basic shared promise that we make to each other that we will never stop fighting against terrorism, and we will be ever vigilant against this  threat to all of America and, indeed, to the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to pay tribute to those in Somerset County who came together this past Monday night for a ceremony entitled "The Spirit of Community: A Service of Remembrance for the Passengers and Crew of Flight 93." I thank, in particular, the families for paying tribute to those in the community of Somerset County who have helped them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
