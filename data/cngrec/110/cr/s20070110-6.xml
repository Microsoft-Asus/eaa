    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday, we made significant progress on the ethics and lobbying reform bill. This will go a long way toward helping to reduce cynicism about this body. We began debate on the bill. The Republican leader and I offered a strong substitute amendment that made numerous important improvements to the underlying bill. And then I offered an amendment to strengthen the bill even further. Then we have had a number of other Senators come to the floor and make statements, offer  amendments. And I think that is certainly appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do emphasize this morning this is not a campaign finance reform bill. My personal feeling is campaign finance reform needs a very close going over. We need to hold extensive hearings on this issue. There are a lot of very complicated issues dealing with campaign finance reform, some of which deal with not only the Rules Committee but the Finance Committee because there are tax implications. I respectfully submit to my colleagues--both in the majority and minority--this is not  the place to do rifle shots on campaign finance reform. I was a real cynic in the past about doing anything with, for example, 527s. I now think we have to take a look at a lot of these campaign finance issues, including 527s. But it has to be done in a thoughtful, probative way. I hope we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a campaign finance bill. Campaign finance is an important issue, and we are going to have a full consideration of campaign finance in this Congress. But this bill is not the place for those amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to Senators continuing to offer amendments today and hope we can make more progress in the coming days to wrap up this bill next week. We will wrap up the bill next week, even if it is a long week. If things slow down or there appears to be some stalling, I will have to see if cloture is the only alternative, which it might be. But for now let's keep moving forward. I have had people come to me and say they have some amendments to offer. I think that is very important. This is  an open process. People should be able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to be in a period of morning business for an hour, as soon as I and the Republican leader sit down. The majority will control the first half hour and the minority will control the last half hour. Once morning business closes, the Senate will resume the consideration of the ethics bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said, there are a number of amendments pending. And as I have indicated, there are other Members who are interested in offering amendments today. I hope we will be in a position later this morning to take action on some of these pending amendments. The managers have expressed their desire to work with Members in regard to these two amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two managers of this bill are two of our finest. Senator Feinstein in the past has managed bills as a member of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Bennett is someone who has a great knowledge of Senate procedures. He is, in my opinion, a Senator's Senator. He does such a good job in everything he is involved in. We have two very good, thoughtful managers of this bill. If anyone can move this forward, I know the two of them can.</paragraph>
