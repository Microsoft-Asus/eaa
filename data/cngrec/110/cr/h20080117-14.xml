    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a Sacred Heart University poll released this month found that less than 20 percent of those surveyed believed news media reporting. Almost nine out of 10 Americans believe that the news media attempt to influence public opinion, and about the same number  think the media attempt to influence public policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fewer than one in three Americans give the media positive rating for "keeping any personal bias out of stories, fairness, presenting and even balance of views, and presenting negative and positive views equally." By four-to-one margins, Americans see the New York Times and National Public Radio as having a liberal bias, and by a three-to-one margin, Americans see journalists and broadcasters as having a liberal bias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to encourage the media to adhere to the highest standards of their profession. Only then can we restore Americans' faith in news reporting.</paragraph>
