    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring the life of Phil Curls, a much-loved member of the Kansas City community. With his passing, Phil has left a legacy of public service that will always be cherished, but Kansas City will not be the same without him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his life, Phil was an integral member of the Kansas City community and was considered by many to be a local patriarch. Phil always cared deeply about others, whether it was his family, a political cause, or mentoring young leaders through Freedom, Inc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phil was a graduate of DeLaSalle High School and earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Rockhurst College. He served 11 years in the Missouri House and 16 years in the State Senate before retiring in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the distinct honor of serving with Phil in the Missouri General Assembly, where his tenure was marked by excellence and community involvement and where I learned important lessons about public leadership from him. Phil was always regarded highly by everyone he interacted with, including his contemporaries as well as older and younger politicians. Through his public service, Phil helped to shape the course that the city and State has taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phil was deeply involved in Freedom, Inc., making sure the community he loved had the political power necessary to bring about positive change. In addition to Freedom, Inc., Phil was involved in so many organizations and had so many achievements and awards that it would be very difficult to list them all. I can, however, state with total certainty that Phil left a permanent mark on Kansas City and will be fondly remembered and dearly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Phil's passing, we have lost a prolific public servant and a passionate individual. I will miss him as a close friend. Phil is survived by his wife of 43 years, Councilwoman Melba Curls; daughter Monica; sons Phil II, Michael, Quincy and Louis; four grandchildren; and a large extended family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring the life and legacy of Phil B. Curls, Sr.</paragraph>
