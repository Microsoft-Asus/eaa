  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to promote the congressional duty to be good stewards of the American taxpayers' money. The American people deserve government that is transparent and open when spending money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans enjoyed a tremendous victory for American families earlier this year when we passed a smart earmark reform policy for spending bills. But we need to ensure that earmarks put in all legislation receive the same amount of scrutiny. That is why I call on Members of this Chamber to join over 160 of our colleagues in signing a discharge petition to force a vote on a resolution that will enforce an open and honest earmark policy on all legislation that comes before this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in standing up for the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
