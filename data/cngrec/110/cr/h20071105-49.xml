    <paragraph>Last weekend, I spoke on a panel about civics and civility at Kansas State University. And during the question-and-answer time, a teacher stood up and asked me a question. She said, Do you know of any books that might be like a checklist that I could share, be a checklist on teaching my kids civics and civility? I thought for a minute, and I said, As a matter of fact, I do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am holding it right here in my hand, Mr. Speaker. It is the Bible. This particular copy was my mother's Bible. And it is the one that I was sworn in last January. So it has a great deal of meaning to me. The lessons in the Bible are truly a checklist for decent living. In Matthew 22, when the disciples asked what is the greatest commandment, it is to love our God with all of our heart and soul and mind, and the second is likened to it, to love thy neighbor as thyself. And then He says, on these  hang all the laws and the prophets. Love thy neighbor as thyself. Very clear. Judge not lest you be judged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible has all the wisdom that we need to bring our country together. And that's why I'm glad the House is pausing tonight to recognize the start of National Bible Week. Faith has an important role to play in the lives of all Americans. It is a role that may be more important today in these dangerous and complicated times than ever before. And it is a role that we, yes, we as public servants have to defend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month, the Architect of the Capitol refused to fulfill a citizen's request for a flag certificate that referred to devotion to God. Just last week, the National Cemetery Administration banned a flag folding ceremony used at veterans' funerals because of references to God. Let's be clear: neither mentioning God in a flag certificate nor speaking of God in a funeral ceremony poses any threat to the separation of church and State. Not only is speaking about religion permitted by the Constitution;  it is a right that is protected by the first amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, both of these bans have been reversed, and not a moment too soon. As we begin National Bible Week, I hope that all of my colleagues and citizens across America will pause to recognize the role that faith plays in all of our lives to reflect on the lessons of the Bible. It is our guidebook. It is our guidebook to civics and civility, as well. It is our how-to guide for public service. Everything we need is right here, folks. It is right here between these two covers.</paragraph>
