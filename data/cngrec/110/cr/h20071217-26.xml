  <narrative>Whereas on November 16, 1907, Oklahoma officially became the 46th State of the Union;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas prior to becoming a State, Oklahoma was designated as Indian Territory, providing a vibrant history and culture that continues to enrich the lives of its citizens;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the State of Oklahoma was shaped by those adventurous and daring individuals who embraced the spirit of this great Nation as they opened the frontier of the American West;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas generations of proud people from all backgrounds have called Oklahoma their home and have contributed to its spirited history;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these hearty and resilient people have defined what has come to be known as the spirit of Oklahoma through their strength, character, and persistent strides toward a bright future;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the continued strength, initiative, and pursuit of excellence displayed by the citizens of the State of Oklahoma have produced its vibrant economy and secured it as a place of opportunity and progress now and for future generations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the solid foundation of family and community embraced by the citizens of Oklahoma has been a constant guide and source of strength to those citizens throughout its history and will remain so long into its future;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the natural beauty and abundant resources of the State of Oklahoma support a quality of life for its citizens that is unsurpassed; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on November 16, 2007, the State of Oklahoma will begin a new century of statehood: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the Congress recognizes and celebrates the centennial of Oklahoma statehood and wishes its people another hundred years of continued growth, prosperity, and achievement.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="hc" number="254">H. Con. Res. 254</bill>, a resolution recognizing and celebrating the centennial anniversary of Oklahoma statehood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="254">H. Con. Res. 254</bill> was introduced by Representative Mary Fallin of Oklahoma on November 13, 2007, and reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 55 Members, has the support of the entire Oklahoma delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Friday, November 16, 2007, marked Oklahoma's centennial celebration. The Sooner State has played a significant role in the development and history of our Nation and will continue to be a cornerstone of the independent spirit that makes our country great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Oklahoma's past achievements, current accomplishments, and the State's goodwill as it continues into the future. I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="254">H. Con. Res. 254</bill>, which recognizes and celebrates the 100th anniversary of Oklahoma statehood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Oklahoma is a State that takes energy production so seriously that it has oil wells on the grounds of the Governor's mansion. It is a State people were so anxious to move into that they jumped the gun in claiming homesteads and entered sooner. That is where the nickname comes from, the Sooner State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at a time in which energy independence is talked about but not achieved, in which States like our own, California, are major energy producers but less than half of the oil that it consumes, Oklahoma continues to aggressively find the resources that lie beneath it and to make it available for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, throughout its heartache, Oklahoma has given us Gene Autry. I won't skip over Brad Pitt. It has given us music. It has given us both country and a number of other great venues. But, most of all, it gave us J.C. Watts, the longest winning streak in history in college football, and they are proud of it. And, last but not least, it gave us Will Rogers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we look at Oklahoma, a State that takes oil seriously, that in fact was rushed into because it was such a great place, I also join with my colleagues in supporting this resolution recognizing that, after 100 years, Oklahoma is still a meaningful and important part of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
