  <narrative>SOARING PRICES, SILENCE AND SECRECY -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2865]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President announced that he's open to ideas to lower soaring gasoline prices. That's good news because I noticed gasoline prices began to rise not long after Vice President Cheney held secret meetings with the energy companies. So the first thing the President ought to do is have the Vice President release the transcripts from those secret meetings. The American people still don't know what the Vice President's energy cabal cooked up. The gasoline  prices have skyrocketed ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's solution is to allow his oil pals to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That keeps us addicted to oil, risks environmental catastrophe but feeds the profits of oil companies. Two of the oil companies, BP and Shell, reported almost $19 billion in profits from the first quarter, and their surrogates in the White House can only meet soaring gas prices with silence and secrecy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President claimed he's looking for new ideas. How about an old reliable one: open government. Tell the people what happened in those secret meetings. Maybe then we will find out why I paid $3.75 for a gallon of gas last night. It was $1.90 when the President came in.</paragraph>
