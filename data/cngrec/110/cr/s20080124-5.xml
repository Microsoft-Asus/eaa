  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today, we are going to quickly resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="2248">S. 2248</bill>, the FISA legislation. Currently, the Judiciary Committee substitute amendment is pending. We hope to reach a time agreement with that amendment soon. I hope we can do it prior to the 12:30 event that we Democrats always have on Thursday. I hope we can do that. I hope there will be a number of rollcall votes today on FISA-related amendments, that we can complete action on this important legislation as quickly  as possible.</paragraph>
