    <paragraph>I rise today to honor Adrianne Karanusic, a registered nurse at Broward General Medical Center, for receiving the Florida Hospital Association's 2007 Hospital Hero of the Year Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A nurse of 18 years, Adrianne showed amazing compassion and dedication to a Croatian patient who spoke no English and fell critically ill from cancer while working on a cruise ship. Adrianne, who speaks Croatian, made herself available as an interpreter and would even call the patient's family in Croatia from her personal cell phone to keep them up to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Adrianne's support and overwhelming compassion for her patient did not end there. Concerned with his mounting bills, she contacted Croatian churches in New York and California, ultimately raising over $10,000 for his medical expenses. She even took a week off to accompany them back so she could explain his clinical ailments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adrianne's incredible kindness and dedication is the epitome of a "Hospital Hero," and I am proud to honor her today on the floor of the United States Congress.</paragraph>
