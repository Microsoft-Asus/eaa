    <paragraph>Madam President, I know everyone wants to leave, but I have to say this. As a younger man, I had a few fights in the ring. They were very minor compared to real fights in the ring with good fighters, but I had some. Today, I had the pleasure of visiting with a Las Vegas resident, Floyd Mayweather, who just beat Oscar De La Hoya in a split decision--a very big fight in Las Vegas. He is a Las Vegas resident, as I mentioned, and I wanted the record to reflect how gracious this man was  to everyone who came up to him in the Senate. He signed autographs, he allowed a lot of pictures to be taken. He was just so nice and such a humble man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the books are written about great fighters, he will have to be near the top of the list, if not at the top. He has been deemed to be the greatest pound-per-pound fighter in the history of America, comparable to Sugar Ray Robinson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is nice that someone who is so famous would remember his roots and have the humility that he does to treat me, someone whom he came to see, no better than he treated all the people that he visited. So Nevada is fortunate that he considers Las Vegas his home.</paragraph>
