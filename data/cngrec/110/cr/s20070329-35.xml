  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the University of Hawaii at Manoa's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, CTAHR, as they commemorate their upcoming centennial. I am pleased to join them in their celebration of a significant milestone that salutes their illustrious achievements in the past, and serves as an enduring foundation for many more in their future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CTAHR was established as a land-grant institution in 1907, and at the time, it was known as the College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts. This nascent institution of higher education was dedicated to research, academic instruction, and community outreach. The first students that enrolled during the college's inaugural academic year received instruction in agriculture, household economics, science, and engineering, all of which are still offered to students by the University of Hawaii. Faculty  members and students identified the necessity for a curriculum that focused on subtropical climates in order to assist Hawaii's farmers. Their initiative and perseverance subsequently led to the development of a tropical agriculture curriculum, a legacy that over the last century lent itself to CTAHR's name, and benefited people in Hawaii, the Pacific region, and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CTAHR's successes are numerous, and those in agriculture range from laying the basis of the macadamia nut industry world-wide, to cultivating Hawaii's robust anthurium cut-flower crop, and developing a seed corn crop export utilizing Hawaii's year-round growing season that was valued at $70 million during the 2005-2006 crop year. In addition, their accomplishments include researching remedies to the environmental problems caused by invasive species such as fruit flies, termites, and the papaya  ringspot virus. Originally, these pests were eliminated using toxic pesticides that inflicted damaged Hawaii's precious and beautiful environment. CTAHR's research and development led to nationally honored alternative nontoxic treatments used by farmers and residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This dedication to the health and well-being of Hawaii's residents extends beyond the laboratory and is demonstrated in their community outreach. In the 1920's CTAHR's Chair in the Home Economics Department was correct and prescient, when she advocated against the reliance on processed foods, and was essential in the nutritional assessment of readily available tropical and sub-tropical fruits and vegetables. World War II starkly highlighted Hawaii's precarious sustainability situation when ships  once used to shuttle goods between the islands were serving our country in a wartime capacity. CTAHR stepped in to increase food production, analyze potable water, and help residents adapt to shortages and blackout conditions. Their outreach continues today, and it is exemplified by the 1991 establishment of "The Center on the Family." This Center bolsters</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of these outstanding distinctions could have been reached if CTAHR did not promote and sustain their tradition of academic excellence. The element fundamental to all of their accolades since their beginning in 1907, and that continues to be at the heart of CTAHR's success is their commitment to meet the highest standards of their federally mandated charge to conduct academic instruction. I would like to thank Dean Andrew G. Hashimoto and his predecessors for their wisdom and leadership over  the last 100 years. It is with great hope, and my best wishes for CTAHR to carry on their established legacy of achievement in all their future endeavors.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I also wish to honor the centennial celebration of the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources. The College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, CTAHR, is the founding college of the University of Hawall system and its flagship campus, the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1907, the Hawaii Territorial Legislature established the College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts under the auspices of the Morrill Act as a land-grant college. The first year that classes were offered, in 1908, the college provided agriculture, household economics, science, and engineering classes, all of which remain part of CTAHR's academic programs to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From its humble beginnings in 1907 to today, CTAHR continues to provide an excellent education and career development opportunities for students. CTAHR has developed a solid foundation in research and educational programs that support tropical agricultural systems and in turn foster viable communities, a diversified economy, and a healthy environment. CTAHR's researchers, instructors, and extension personnel continue to research and develop new crops that will reduce our reliance on imported  foods, improve food security, and diversify Hawaii's agriculture to explore alternative markets. In addition, the college has played an integral role in further enhancing our understanding of environmental science and advancing agricultural and resource management approaches that conserve and protect Hawaii's natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CTAHR offers a diverse curriculum that continues to prepare an educated and experienced workforce to meet the State of Hawaii's environmental, agricultural, animal science, dietetic, engineering, and human resource industry needs. CTAHR empowers both students and the public to learn about and proactively engage in better managing the limited resources of our islands. Research conducted by its faculty and through its undergraduate, master, and doctoral programs contribute not only to our local  knowledge but in many cases represent field breakthroughs and establishment of cutting edge technologies. CTAHR will continue to not only enhance the physical landscape of our islands and improve the quality of life for all in Hawaii and across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I honor the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources for 100 years of service to the people of Hawaii, the Pacific region, and the Nation in its dedication to the development of sustainable agriculture and human resources programs to meet the needs of our changing communities. </paragraph>
