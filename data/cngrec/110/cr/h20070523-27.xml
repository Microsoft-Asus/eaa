  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 429 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I also ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 429.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Resolution 429 provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill>, the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site Boundary Revision Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources and makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule also allows for consideration of all three amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee on <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me begin by congratulating my good friend and freshman class colleague Mr. Shuler for working this thoughtful legislation through the legislative process. <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill> will further preserve the legacy and communicate the stories of internationally recognized author, Pulitzer Prize-winner, and great American historian, Carl Sandburg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in the pristine wilderness of North Carolina is the 248-acre Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site. Each year, over 150,000 people visit for the purpose of learning about Carl Sandburg's positive influences on writing, or to hike and just enjoy the splendor of this beautiful, pristine site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years it was determined by interested parties at all levels, local, State and Federal, including the National Park Service, that increasing  the size would be desirable to carry out the purposes of this historic site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill> addresses the need for more space by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to acquire up to 115 acres of land from willing sellers by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, for some unknown reason, some my colleagues have labeled this legislation an "egregious example of landgrabbing" by the Federal Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. The key point to this legislation is that the land would have to be acquired from "willing sellers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the 115 acres, 5 acres would be used to construct a new visitor center and parking lot, and the remaining 110 acres would be used to enhance the overall experience when visiting the site. Visitors will now have an opportunity to sit on the same ridge Carl Sandburg sat to pen some of his greatest works and explore the same beautiful mountainside Carl Sandburg would frequent with his family for picnics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill> has strong bipartisan support here in the House, and bicameral support from North Carolina's two Senators, who have introduced companion legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill> has the support of the administration, as well as the State of North Carolina and Henderson County, where the site is located.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of that said, with such broad support, one might ask why are we here debating a rule for consideration of this legislation? The reason is that during a subcommittee and later full committee markup, it was discovered that there are a few Members of this body who object to the legislation in its current form. Those Members made several attempts to alter the existing legislation by amendment during the committee process. In addition, those same Members submitted amendments to the Rules Committee  which we will consider later today, again seeking to alter this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While one might argue that our debate today is unnecessary, I contend it is yet another example of the majority's efforts to provide our colleagues with opportunities to offer their amendments, voice their views, and make their objections known here in the House Chamber. I look forward to a fruitful discussion of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 429 allows for consideration of <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill>, the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site Boundary Revision Act, which would increase our Federal inventory of land by up to 115 acres. Rarely does the Rules Committee consider rules for bills making changes to historic sites because they are typically brought to the floor under suspension of the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, coming from an area in central Washington that is 40 percent federally owned land mass, I believe we ought to be encouraging land exchanges where possible rather than more land purchases. The Federal land management agencies simply have too much land to manage effectively with their current level of funding. We all know there is a serious backlog of road, trail and facility maintenance on Federal lands. In many cases, Federal land agencies are struggling to manage invasive species,  plant pests, and unnaturally high fuel loads that lead to catastrophic wildfires. Yet, year after year, we are spending precious tax dollars to buy up more private property and take it off the local tax rolls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make land exchanges and the orderly restructuring of Federal land holdings easier. The Federal Government owns and must maintain many small, isolated parcels of land that have no special resource value. We should make it easier for the Federal agencies to dispose of these properties and retain the proceeds to acquire lands that are high in resource value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is a practical solution that allows us to protect special places without having to spend limited tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also add that there are many other issues, in my view more pressing matters, affecting public lands management that we could be considering today. For example, the extension of payments to forested counties for rural schools and roads. As many of my colleagues are aware, the Congress long ago promised rural communities that they would get a fair share of the revenue produced from Federal forestlands as compensation for the tax-exempt status of Federal forestlands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, unfortunately, special interest groups successfully used litigation under the Endangered Species Act to bring harvest to a standstill in many places like the Pacific Northwest. This left many counties struggling to pay for basic services while saddled with large areas of nontaxable Federal land. Although the House has passed legislation providing for a 1-year fix on this issue, we need a longer-term solution, and we need to get this legislation to the President's desk as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House will soon have an opportunity to consider these and other issues impacting Federal land management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond by saying that it's important to note on this bill that all this bill really does is to create an environment for people to donate the land or for funds to be donated to actually purchase the land, and we're not talking about a vast tract of land. We're talking about a very small amount of land, 115 acres, 22 acres of which have already been pledged, and basically are waiting for this legislation to be passed so that the conservatory could be created  so that the acreage can be donated to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would say in response to my good friend and colleague from Washington that this is not any type of huge land grab. This is really just a very small amount of acreage that is being set up and being donated just to enhance the whole, again, experience of the Carl Sandburg site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is a very good bill. It is a good rule, and I would urge all of my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just point out that this is an increase of 44 percent over the current land value, and I know we're talking about acres and we're not talking about square miles. But to paraphrase former Senator Edward Dirksen, in another sense, you know, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real dollars. Well, we're talking about Federal land ownership, and I'm very sensitive to that because I come from the western part of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, 40 percent of my district is owned by the Federal Government, and I have some counties in which 75 percent of the counties' land mass is owned by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I'm pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today and it goes back to the experience we had on the floor and in committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bishop had offered an amendment in the National Parks Subcommittee that would have improved this bill, in my opinion, because his amendment would have reduced the number of acres that are being added to this so-called park. This was not Carl Sandburg's original home. The acreage being added or sought to be added is not even available for view from the Sandburg home. It was not part of the original home. So it made sense that an amendment like this ought to have a vote and it did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it came time for a recorded vote, the subcommittee chairman promised to hold the vote open for 15 minutes. About 8 to 9 minutes later, though, for some time the vote on the amendment was passing, once there was one more vote "nay" than in the affirmative, between 8 and 9 minutes later, the chairman closed the vote, even though he said he would leave it open for 15 minutes. He closed it as I walked into the door and others alerted him, and actually he never said that  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H5646]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we went through a series of parliamentary inquiries to make sure that the chairman had every opportunity to do the right thing, and so that it was not quite as clear as it became, that there was only one reason that vote was held open, and that was to foreclose the opportunity to pass this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the House rules say that a record vote shall not be held open on the floor for the purpose of changing the outcome of a vote. Clearly, that's what happened here. Clearly, it would have changed the outcome of the vote, at least as I came in, to a tie with other people coming if the vote had been held open as long as the chairman said he was going to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the promises of bipartisanship in this Chamber, as we saw it yesterday, as we saw in this subcommittee hearing, are about as hollow as some of the other things around this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as far as the rule, it should have been open to this amendment. The amendment should have been part of the original bill, but through this procedural folly, it was not. And so I object to the rule. I rise in opposition to the rule, and I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to remember their promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know it's been clear back to November and all those campaign promises leading up to November, and that's a long time, even though the Attorney General is being condemned for forgetting things further back than that. Nonetheless, we won't get into questions of hypocrisy. I just ask you to remember your promises about bipartisanship and open government, because this rule forecloses the openness that we were promised we would have, especially when it pertains to a good amendment that deserves  consideration before this floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I must say I'm a bit confused because the gentleman from Texas is opposing the rule, the rule which is allowing the amendment that he is speaking of. So the Rules Committee has put the amendment in, the Bishop amendment, that he's talking about. It will entitle a full and fair debate on it this afternoon, and we are giving the gentleman everything that he has asked for. And he stands up here and talks about some type of hypocrisy, and frankly, I just don't understand  why he is mentioning that, why he is talking about that when, in fact, we are giving the rule that allows for debate on that particular amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are, in fact, giving the gentleman exactly what he is asking for, and he is opposing the rule. So I guess I just don't understand what his point is, but I would say that we are supporting the rule that, in fact, does allow for full and fair debate on this particular amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. There were three amendments made in order on this bill, and what I have a problem with is the process and how ridiculously partisan it was there, and there should have been more made in order here, but I do appreciate what has been made in order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just simply want to say that the gentleman from Texas, a member of the committee, was apparently told something by the subcommittee chairman and that wasn't carried out, and I think that's the point that he made. I am pleased that the committee has made these three amendments in order. They were debated, and I think the full House deserves that consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the rule could have been, obviously, better if it were an open rule on a bill here that certainly is not that controversial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill> will further preserve the legacy and communicate the stories of internationally recognized author, Pulitzer Prize winner and great American historian, Carl Sandburg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I congratulate my good friend and freshman class colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler) for his efforts to bring this thoughtful legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting "yes" on the previous question and on the rule so that future generations can also enjoy the beauty and splendor of the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the resolution.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on adoption of the resolution will be followed by 5-minute votes on motions to suspend the rules and pass <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> and <bill type="h" number="2429">H.R. 2429</bill>.</chair>
