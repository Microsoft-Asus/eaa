    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to congratulate the Hinsdale Central Red Devils on winning the Illinois State Boys Tennis Tournament held at Hersey High School in Arlington Heights. This year's State finals mark the second consecutive State championship for Central's boys tennis team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Team member Augie Bloom placed third in singles and the doubles team of Dan Ballantine and Ian Tesmond placed fifth in the State. Additionally, teammates Krishna Ravella, Paul Cooper and Josh Sink all contributed to brining home the prize. Their outstanding performance on the court won 37 points, a one-point margin of victory. Guiding the team to victory were coach Jay Kramer and assistant coaches John Naisbitt and Bro Ballantine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our community is very proud of these champions, who worked so hard for this victory. Their dedication and fighting spirit is a testament to their school and the State of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I congratulate the Hinsdale Central Red Devils on their state title, and wish them the best of luck in future seasons.</paragraph>
