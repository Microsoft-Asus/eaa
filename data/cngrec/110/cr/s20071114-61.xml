  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I was pleased to introduce a Senate resolution recognizing November 14 as World Diabetes Day. I am also pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Pete Domenici and Frank Lautenberg. Established in 1991 by the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation, this day has been recognized annually as World Diabetes Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through World Diabetes Day, advocates worldwide can coordinate diabetes awareness activities and create a sense of urgency about this devastating disease. In almost every nation, diabetes is on the rise. In the United States, diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death by disease. Globally, diabetes is fourth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diabetes currently affects 246 million people worldwide and is projected to affect 380 million by 2025. Last year, the United Nations passed landmark Resolution 61/225 recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, over 3.7 million people die due to diabetes. An even greater number die from cardiovascular disease exacerbated by diabetes-related lipid disorders. Every 10 seconds, two people develop diabetes and one person dies from diabetes-related causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in Michigan--from 5.3 percent to 7.9 percent over the past 10 years. There are 1.3 million Michiganians who have diabetes or are prediabetic. Michigan has the seventh highest rate of diabetes in the Nation, and diabetes costs our State's economy $6 billion a year in health costs and lost productivity. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in Michigan and the fourth leading cause of death among African-American females in Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the World Diabetes Day campaign will focus on the message that no child should die of diabetes." I take this goal very seriously. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I am committed to ensuring our children have healthy options in their school meals. And I am working with Senator DOMENICI on reauthorizing the Special Diabetes Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can no longer ignore the growing incidence of diabetes. Instead, let us draw worldwide attention to prevention, access, and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am pleased to have letters of support from diabetes advocacy organizations. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>INTERNATIONAL DIABETES FEDERATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Brussels, Belgium, November 11, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR U.S. SENATOR STABENOW AND U.S. SENATOR DOMENICI: The International Diabetes Federation (IDF), an over 50-year old worldwide alliance of over 200 diabetes associations in more than 160 countries, is pleased to endorse <bill type="hc" number="211">H. Con. Res. 211</bill>, your resolution supporting the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day.</narrative>
  <narrative>Established by the World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation in 1991, World Diabetes Day has been commemorated annually on November 14th. World Diabetes Day has succeeded in elevating and coordinating diabetes advocacy globally. Further, it is especially meaningful for the international diabetes advocacy community that on December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a landmark Resolution recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating and costly disease.</narrative>
  <narrative>Cities and nations all over the world are holding events to celebrate World Diabetes  Day. For example, in Egypt, the well-known Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Library of Alexandria) will light up in blue on November 14th. And, La Federaci&#xF3;n Mexicana de Diabetes (Mexican Diabetes Federation) has planned a series of events throughout Mexico to mark this year's World Diabetes Day, including a diabetes awareness week in Jalisco, walks in Mexico City and  Guanajuato, and activities for children and adolescents in Chihuahua.</narrative>
  <narrative>Senators Stabenow and Domenici, we share your particular enthusiasm that the 2007 Campaign's theme focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents, who face unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes. The campaign aims, among other objectives, to firmly establish the message that "no child should die of diabetes".</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your leadership on this important global health awareness campaign, Senators Stabenow and Domenici.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>November 14, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATORS: On behalf of the 20.8 million children and adults living with diabetes in the Unites States, the American Diabetes Association is pleased to endorse your resolution supporting the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day. This important day has succeeded in elevating and coordinating diabetes education and advocacy around the world and we applaud your leadership in bringing congressional attention to it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Established by the World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation in 1991, World Diabetes Day has been commemorated annually on November 14th. On December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a landmark Resolution recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating and costly disease, and designating World Diabetes Day as a United Nations Day to be observed every year starting this year.</narrative>
  <narrative>As you know, Diabetes is a lifelong chronic disease that has become a health problem of epidemic proportions around the globe. More than 240 million people worldwide are living with diabetes. This number is expected to exceed 350 million in less than 20 years if action is not taken. Diabetes is the fifth highest cause of disease-related death, killing more than 2.9 million people from diabetesrelated complications annually, greater than 600 people each day in our own country. In fact, every  10 seconds a person dies of diabetes-related causes--including heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease and amputations.</narrative>
  <narrative>Children are not spared from this global epidemic, with its debilitating and life-threatening complications. The theme of this year's World Diabetes Day campaign is `Diabetes in Children and Adolescents.' Type 1 diabetes is growing by 3% per year in children and adolescents, and at an alarming 5% per year among pre-school children. Type 2 diabetes was once seen as a disease of adults. Today, this type of diabetes is growing at alarming rates in children and adolescents. In the United States,  it is estimated that type 2 diabetes represents between 8 and 45% of new-onset diabetes cases in children depending on geographic location. Early diagnosis and early education are crucial to reducing complications and saving lives.</narrative>
  <narrative>Senator Stabenow and Senator Domenici, we share your enthusiasm that the 2007 Campaign's theme focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents, who face unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes. Passage of this resolution will send a powerful message about the seriousness of this disease and help to alleviate the human, economic and social burden of diabetes.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you, again, for your leadership on this important global health awareness campaign. In this, and in other diabetes issues, the American Diabetes Association stands ready to support your efforts.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the global diabetes epidemic has devastating effects on families, societies, and national economies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is the 4th leading cause of death by disease in the world, and is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart attack, and stroke;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in almost every country the incidence of diabetes is increasing, growing from an estimated 30,000,000 people worldwide in 1985 to an estimated 245,000,000 people in 2007, and to 380,000,000 by 2025, as reported by the International Diabetes Federation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes can strike children at any age, and when diagnosed in young people the risk of developing life-threatening complications at an early age increases and life expectancy is shortened by, on average, 10 to 20 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas new figures from the International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes Atlas suggest that more than 70,000 children develop type 1 diabetes each year and 440,000 children worldwide under the age of 14 now live with type 1 diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas recent data indicate that 1 out of every 3 children born in the United States will develop diabetes during their lifetime, including 1 out of every 2 children from ethnic minority groups;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in low- and middle-income countries, many children with diabetes die because they are diagnosed late or misdiagnosed or because insulin is unaffordable, unavailable, or in short supply;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the incidence of type 2 diabetes, which was previously rare in children, is rising at alarming rates, with more than 200 children a day developing this form of diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas obesity is a major contributor to type 2 diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas according to the International Obesity Task Force of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, 155,000,000 school-age children worldwide are overweight, representing at least 1 out of every 10 school-age children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas at least 30,000,000 of those overweight children are classified as obese, accounting for at least 2 percent of the world's children between the ages of 5 and 17 years of age;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas research has shown conclusively that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or significantly delayed through healthy weight maintenance and regular physical activity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas adopting a lifestyle high in physical activity and adopting a low-sugar, low-fat diet can successfully prevent the onset of obesity and diabetes among school-age children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is costly, with the world estimated to spend at least $232,000,000,000 in 2007 and over $302,500,000,000 by 2025 to treat and prevent diabetes and its complications;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas world treatment costs for diabetes are growing more quickly than the world population;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes threatens to subvert global economic advancement by both straining government budgets worldwide (with the cost of diabetes-related disability payments, pensions, social and medical service costs, and lost revenue) and burdening private health insurers and employers with spiraling health care costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas by 2025 the largest increases in diabetes prevalence will take place in developing countries, whose economies are less able to support increased expenditures to provide for those with the disease and engage in effective prevention efforts; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the economic impact of diabetes threatens to undermine the achievement of the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals for developing countries: Now, therefore, be it</chair>
