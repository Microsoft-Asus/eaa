    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to our guest chaplain, the Reverend Elton Van Welton of Leesburg, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Van Welton is the senior pastor of Crossroads Baptist Church. In the two short years he has been at Crossroads, the church membership has grown dramatically, and its rate of financial giving to world missions to the poor and to the hungry has increased by over 500 percent. He has also worked to establish many local ministries, such as Saving Addicts for Eternity, which partners with local Narcotics Anonymous groups to provide spiritual guidance to those struggling with addiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Van Welton first joined the ministry in 1999 after receiving a master's in divinity from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Before his career as a pastor, Reverend Van Welton received his juris doctorate from Regent University and was a practicing attorney in the Commonwealth of Virginia before he received his call to the ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Rev. Van Welton for his dedication to spreading the word of the gospel and for his faithful service to our community in northern Virginia. It is a blessing to have him here today to serve as our guest chaplain.</paragraph>
