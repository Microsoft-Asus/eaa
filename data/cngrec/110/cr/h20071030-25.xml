    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to discuss poverty and homelessness in the San Gabriel Valley in the 32nd Congressional District. At least 43 percent of adults living below the Federal poverty line in L.A. County have worked either full-time or part-time. They have to balance rent or mortgage payments, child care, food, gas prices, and health care. The increasing costs can lead to homelessness if you can't make these payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Los Angeles County, over 152,000 people are homeless over the course of a year; and in the city of Azusa, at least 1,500 children were homeless last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that Democrats have taken steps to reduce poverty and homelessness. In 2007, our farm bill raised the minimum benefit in the food stamp program for the first time in 30 years. For the first time in more than 10 years, we have raised the minimum wage and expanded American homeownership, and also would help to provide and ensure that low-income and middle-income families have affordable mortgage loans.</paragraph>
