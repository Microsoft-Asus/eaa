  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, earlier today, I spoke with the Attorney General of the United States. He is going to be testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow morning. We anticipate it will be for much of the day. He wished to inform me, as he did Senator Specter, of some changes in the so-called FISA Program. I have been very critical of the administration's actions through the National Security Agency--their wiretapping of Americans, wiretapping of people throughout  the country, and apparently doing so without obtaining any warrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly enough, the information about this spying on Americans came not from our administration reporting it either through the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee or the appropriate committees involved; it came out because, like so many other things we find out about, we read about it first in the newspaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apparently, the administration has decided not to continue this warrantless spying program on Americans, but instead to seek approval for all wiretaps from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this based on the letter sent to us. This is public; this is not a classified matter. The law has required for years that they do it this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I welcome the President's decision not to reauthorize the NSA's warrantless spying program because, as I have pointed out for some time, and as other Senators on both sides of the aisle have pointed out, the program was, at very best, of doubtful legality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since this program was first revealed, I have urged this administration to inform Congress of what the Government is doing and to comply with the checks and balances Congress wrote into law in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we must engage in all surveillance necessary to prevent acts of terrorism, but we can and we should do it in ways that protect the basic rights of all Americans, including the right to privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue has never been whether to monitor suspected terrorists--everybody agrees with that; all Americans do. The question is whether we can do it legally and with proper checks and balances to prevent abuses. Providing efficient but meaningful court review is a major step toward addressing those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to urge the President to fully inform Congress and the American people about the contours of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order authorizing the surveillance program and of the program itself. Only with meaningful oversight can we assure the balance necessary to achieve security with liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from the Attorney General, dated January 17, addressed to me and Senator Specter, which indicates copies to numerous other people, be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I was a prosecutor for 8 years. I enjoyed being a prosecutor. But I also was well aware that we acted within checks and balances. Courts had their role, prosecutors had their role, defense attorneys had their role. It only worked when everybody did what they were supposed to, including the executive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also a prosecutor and on the board of the National District Attorneys Association at the time of COINTELPRO, a program of spying on Americans who disagreed with the war in Vietnam, and even, we found out later, spying on Martin Luther King because he was speaking so radically as to suggest that we might actually want equality between people, no matter what their color might be, in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Government was spying on people who objected to war. Our Government was spying on people who wanted integration in America. I don't want us to go back to that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I shudder to think what might have happened if J. Edgar Hoover had had all the electronic capabilities we have today. The only way we stop this--it makes no difference if we have a Democratic or Republican administration--the only way we stop it is with the checks and balances we have built in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FISA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court came about because of illegal spying on Americans who were not committing any unlawful act, but were simply questioning what their Government was doing. Many of us  worry that has happened now. We have seen, for example, that the Department of Defense has had surveillance, has even recorded movies, of Quakers protesting war. Quakers always protest wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes, under the same agreement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>They always do this. We heard in the press that there has been surveillance of Vermonters who protested the war. I can save them money. Turn on C-SPAN. I do it all the time on the Senate floor, if they want to find a Vermonter who may protest the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question here is a greater one. What right does our Government--our Government, which is there to serve all of us--have to spy on individual Americans exercising their rights? Of course, go after terrorists, but to go after terrorists, you can do it within the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished occupant of the chair, the Presiding Officer, is also a former prosecutor. She knows how we have to go to court and follow the law for search warrants or anything else. In this area of foreign intelligence, we have made it very easy and very quick for the government to go before special courts, FISA courts. Let's do that, because when this administration or any administration says they are above the law, they don't have to follow the law, they can step outside the law, they  don't have to follow checks and balances, then I say all Americans, no matter what your political leaning might be, all Americans ought to ask why are they doing this, why are they doing this. Because it doesn't in the long run protect us, not if we let them take away our liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Utah is recognized.</chair>
