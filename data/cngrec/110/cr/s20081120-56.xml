  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DR. CHARLES E. LEA -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10734">S10734</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the life of a truly outstanding Missourian. On October 7, 2008, this nation lost a son, a soldier, and a community servant when Dr. Charles E. Lea of Lexington, MO, passed away. While we mourn his passing, we are extraordinarily grateful for all that he gave to his community, his State, and his country during his lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that Dr. Lea is a wonderful example and reminder of the brave men and women who have served our country in the past and continue to serve it today in this time of great need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1957, Dr. Lea graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, and after putting himself through medical school at the University of Missouri, volunteered for service in Vietnam. Widely regarded and recognized as a humble servant, Dr. Lea was awarded the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, the Soldier's Medal, four Air Medals, the Army Commendation Medal, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, the Combat Medical Badge, and the Parachutist Badge for his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While awards and commendations obviously show a great deal about a person, I am a believer that the strength of a person's character is revealed in his or her daily actions. Those who knew Dr. Lea best shared an anecdote with me regarding his time in Vietnam. Dr. Lea was featured in newspapers and on television here at home for his efforts during the war to save a village elephant that had been shot. Seemingly insignificant at the time, those efforts placed the United States, and our servicemen  and women, in high regard in the eyes of the Vietnamese village. This small effort, not part of his duty or orders, but undertaken by a man trying to make a difference, had an extensive impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his military service, Dr. Lea became a general practice family physician and served countless families in Oklahoma and Missouri throughout his medical career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I reflect on Dr. Lea's life today, I am reminded not only of the value of his personal service and sacrifice, but of the committed service and selfless sacrifice of all the men and women who have served this country in uniform. America owes a large debt to all of the remarkable men and women who have served this great nation. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Lea and his family, and in remembrance of his life and his service, my utmost gratitude goes to all those who have served.</paragraph>
