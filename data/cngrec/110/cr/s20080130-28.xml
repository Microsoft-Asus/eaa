  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TRENT LOTT -- (Senate - January 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="488">S488</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, across America, those citizens who have on occasion chosen--or been required--to listen to congressional debate have often heard the Senate described as an "Institution." It is a term which has been overused and perhaps misused more than once, but I believe it is quite appropriately applied in observing that with Senator Trent Lott's departure, we have lost a reservoir of institutional knowledge, knowledge which has been of enormous value to Members of every political  stripe for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The breadth of Trent Lott's experience--on both sides of the aisle, in both Chambers of Congress, as back bencher, and as a member of leadership--has given him an insight into and understanding of the legislative process unique among his peers. We have heard many colleagues describe the effect of that experience when combined with the persuasive personality of the Mississippi gulf coast: No one counted votes better, and perhaps more important, no one enjoyed it more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within our caucus, in committee rooms, and on the floor, Trent could rely time and again on the great friendships and professional respect developed through years of hard work. Even more valuable perhaps, he understood the unusual psychology, decisionmaking, and ego unique to Members of Congress. We all perceive the important role these factors play in our work; few have been able to master them to their use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Trent, however, counting votes was only the means to a more important end--being an effective Senator. He has long been a strong voice for the State of Mississippi, but he has also developed the habit of finding his way to the center of the legislative storm at the crucial moment when a final deal is struck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On matters of policy, I have worked both alongside and against Trent--even coming out ahead once or twice. Those rare events have revealed him to accept loss gracefully, negotiate in good faith, and accept compromise without conceding principle. These are traits essential to integrity and stability in governance, but also traits that strengthened his hand for the next battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, the experience, the ability, the "institutional knowledge" we lose is very real. I count Senator Lott as more than a valued colleague; he is also a valued friend. As a Senator, in my first term, I have always been able to count on Trent for sound and thoughtful advice, which always reflected his sincere concern for the personal well-being, career, and family of all with whom he served. I always took confidence from the fact that he unabashedly placed family at the top of his priorities,  and understood that our public service should not take place at our families' expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, although I am the youngest Member of the U.S. Senate, and still serving in my first term, I am grateful to Senator Lott for his commitment to keeping the Senate strong. The Framers of our Constitution saw the Senate as the legislative body that would maintain an even keel, engage in meaningful debate, and forge legislation through the art of compromise  that addresses the challenges of our day. Through successes and failings, Trent has always  been true to this purpose. Most important to him, he has also been true to his constituents, and to his family. I trust that these priorities will continue to guide him, and know they will bring him success for many years to come.</paragraph>
