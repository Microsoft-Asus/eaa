  <narrative>HONORING THE PEACE CORPS -- (Senate - February 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1115">S1115</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor National Peace Corps Week and the 47th anniversary of the Peace Corps. I add my voice to celebrate the hard working men and women who volunteer for Peace Corps service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an Arkansan and a believer in Senator J. William Fulbright's legacy, I consider this program to be one of the most important mechanisms we have to encourage international cooperation, peace, and security. I believe we are morally obliged to help those in need around the world and work to reduce poverty in order to fight global epidemics, to enhance education, and to reduce hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am continually heartened by the good works of Arkansans in the State, Nation, and abroad. Our State has a storied history of service, and I am pleased that there are 36 Arkansans currently serving as Peace Corps volunteers in Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. I am proud to say that Arkansas is also home to one of the pioneering families of the Peace Corps, Carolyn and the late Bob Moffett. Inspired by President Kennedy's challenge to the American people, Bob entered into service  as a volunteer in the summer of 1962. Carolyn was with Bob every step of the way and devoted her life to taking care of her family and the other volunteers; hosting holidays, weddings, and even funerals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Bob and Carolyn are just one story in the 47 years of Peace Corps history. Working in the fields of education, health and HIV/AIDS, the environment, youth, agriculture, information technology, and business development, 190,000 brave men and women, serving in 139 countries, have dedicated over 2 years of their lives to make significant achievements, enriching the lives of others and serving their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these uncertain times, Peace Corps volunteers remain committed to the goals of international peace, friendship, and understanding by sharing their unparalleled experience to those back home. I pray that the good work of these and other Peace Corps volunteers will raise awareness and that others will be called to follow their good example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the record, I would like to submit the names of the 36 Arkansans currently serving in the Peace Corps. They are John Armstrong, Amanda Barker, Anthony Barnum, Melanie Berman, Susan Boswell Pierce, Robert Bryant, Allyson Carr, Adam Carson, Garrard Conley, Erin Gibbs, Jared Gillis, Laurel Gladish, Allison Green, Rebecca Hedges, Cameron Highsmith, Brian Hilburn, Joseph Hill, James Hollins, Jenny Hurst, Julia Jones, Adelia Kittrell, Nicholas Klinger, Theodis Lever, Tara Loftis, Stanley Luker,  Jennifer Lusk, Daniel McGinley, Joshua Mosley, Danielle Rinke, Mary Rinnert, Rebecca Robinson, Deborah Romes, Christin Spradley, Kristen Straw, Jackson Taylor, Nikolette Williams. I thank them all for their devoted service to their country and steadfast dedication to improving the lives of the disadvantaged.</paragraph>
