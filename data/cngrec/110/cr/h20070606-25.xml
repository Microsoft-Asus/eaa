  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stem cell research has the capability to cure our most common and pervasive diseases and conditions. From Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease, cancer to juvenile diabetes, the potential of stem cell research presents one of humanity's greatest leaps toward the ultimate goal of preserving, prolonging and improving life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Florida State Senate for 10 years, leading efforts to utilize and fund embryonic stem cell research was not just a priority of mine, it was a mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A large part of my passion and drive toward funding stem cell research is driven by people like Adam Susser, a young boy from the town I reside in, Boca Raton. Adam was asphyxiated at birth and, as a result, is cortically blind with quadriplegic cerebral palsy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is driven by Matthew Romer, a young boy in south Florida who died from a fatal genetic disease, despite both parents being told they did not carry the gene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Adam and Matthew suffer from illnesses that stem cell research could find cures for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I encourage my friends in Congress to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The passage of this Act is vitally important to the millions of Americans who suffer today from incurable disease and to the millions of Americans who will suffer from incurable diseases in the future.</paragraph>
