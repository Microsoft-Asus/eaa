    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 13 to 15, the residents of Dunseith will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dunseith is a historic community located in north central North Dakota, only 14 miles away from the Canadian border. Founded by Giles Gilbert in 1882, Dunseith was settled by European immigrants and members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. In its early years, people were drawn to Dunseith because of the amount of land in the area made available under the Homestead Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a short distance from Dunseith is the International Peace Garden. Founded in 1932, this 2,339-acre garden along the northern border symbolizes the peace, cooperation, and friendship between the United States and Canada. It is a treasure of more than 150,000 flowers, fountains, a sunken garden, and other notable structures that promote the garden's message of peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dunseith really is, as the residents say, an area undiscovered by the rest of the country. With the beautiful Turtle Mountains just nearby, residents like to spend time hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, and participating in various other outdoor activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Dunseith has much to celebrate. Its quasquicentennial celebration is occurring at the same time as the International Peace Garden's 75th anniversary, and it is bound to be a weekend worth taking in. With 450 registered participants already, the guests will enjoy an all-school reunion, parade, art show, all faith service, demolition derby, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Dunseith, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Dunseith and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Dunseith that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dunseith has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
