    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a young man beloved by his family, friends and his community. I rise to remember Specialist Tyler Ross Seideman of the United States Army who was taken from us 2 weeks ago today in Multaka, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tyler and 13 of his Army brothers passed away when the Black Hawk he was in went down due to mechanical problems. Tyler, from the small town of Lincoln, Arkansas, was a sniper in the 2nd Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment based out of Hawaii. His closest friends described him with adjectives such as "brave," a "great soldier" and a "perfect gentleman."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity to attend Tyler's funeral this past Saturday. The outpouring of love and support from the people of Lincoln is something I will remember for the rest of my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My prayers and those of my family are with Tyler's parents, Bill and Lee Ann, and sisters Kiera and Kristen. I thank them for raising a man such as Tyler, and I thank Tyler for his service to a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
