    <paragraph>Mr. President, their Web site is called frozenchosen.org. No kidding. Today I honor Congregation Beth Shalom of Anchorage, AK, an affiliate of the Union for Reform Judaism, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. It is a pillar of Alaska's small but vibrant Jewish community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congregation Beth Shalom is one of five synagogues in the State of Alaska. Only two of those five synagogues enjoy the services of a full-time rabbi. Congregation Beth Shalom is one of these two synagogues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to acknowledge and welcome Rabbi Michael Oblath, the present Rabbi, who joined Congregation Beth Shalom in September 2007. He is the fifth Rabbi to serve the congregation since its founding on September 5, 1958. It is also appropriate to recognize the four other individuals who have served as spiritual leaders to Congregation Beth Shalom since its founding, beginning with Rabbi Lester Polonsky, Rabbi Harry Rosenfeld, Rabbi Johanna Hershenson, and Rabbi Fred Wenger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congregation Beth Sholom was first organized on September 5, 1958. It was on that day that 20 people gathered in Burt and Bobbie Goldberg's home to welcome the Shabbat and organize a synagogue. At the time, the only Jewish services in Anchorage were being conducted by chaplains on Elmendorf Air Force Base, and organizers wanted to establish a Jewish identity for their children which were anchored to the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Congregation Beth Shalom occupies a beautiful synagogue building on East Northern Lights Boulevard, which opened 20 years ago to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the congregation's founding. The synagogue houses the Joy Greisen Jewish Education Center, which features a preschool open to the entire community, without regard to religious affiliation, an afterschool arts program and a summer camp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congregation Beth Shalom has achieved Green Star recognition for its environmental and energy conservation efforts. Its Tikkun Olam program is engaged in numerous good works which help make Anchorage one of the best places in our Nation to live and raise a family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize Congregation Beth Shalom on 50 years of service to our southcentral Alaska community. We have great expectations for your next 50 years.</paragraph>
