  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Americans are now looking at $4 a gallon for gasoline. Is it going up to $5 a gallon?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is having a severe impact on family budgets. It's kind of a regressive tax on the poor and working people of this country, hitting those hardest who are least able to pay. And low-wage workers who commute are finding an increasingly difficult time being able to survive. It's having a devastating impact on our manufacturing economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for a new energy policy. It's time for a massive investment by Detroit in fuel efficiency and retooling and hybrids. It's time to end our reliance on oil. It's time to invest in alternative energy, like wind and solar. It's time to stop wars for resources. It's time to stop aggression in the Middle East. It's time to cooperate internationally to protect the environment. It's time to end NAFTA to make environmental quality principles part of our energy policy. It's time to regain control  over America's economy and America's future.</paragraph>
