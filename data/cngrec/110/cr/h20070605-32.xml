    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>) calling on the Government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur, Sudan.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six days ago, the President imposed a new series of sanctions on the Sudanese government and its murderous leaders. The administration may have sent a stronger message a month ago, but did not. But new American sanctions, however belatedly imposed, are in place. Now the rest of the civilized world must respond. Strong sanctions represent a crucial bridge in efforts to force the regime in Khartoum to give  up its reprehensible program of genocide in Darfur.  But it is now readily apparent that we can only cross that bridge with the help of China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time and again, we have witnessed national interests taking precedence over the destruction of people's lives, their society and their culture. China, purely for economic interests, in our opinion, has stood firmly in the way of a robust international response to the Darfur genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been 3 years since this Congress declared that the unfolding atrocities in Darfur constitute genocide. Yet, since it began, China has acted as a shield for Sudan against international criticism and tough sanctions at the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of unimpeachable evidence of genocide and other atrocities, China has continued as Sudan's largest trading partner and the main foreign investor in its oil sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's sales of arms and military equipment to Khartoum is even more disturbing. But China has taken it one step further by actually blocking efforts to send international forces into Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several countries have been resistant. But among the states unwilling to support a robust civilian protection operation to stop the genocide, China assumes a unique culpability because of its influence, its permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, and its role in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, China forced the Security Council to water down an oil sanctions resolution and threatened it would veto any future resolutions sanctioning Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China shielded Khartoum against international sanctions while the Sudanese military drove tens of thousands out of their communities and oil regions just to speed exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, China explicitly argued to the Security Council against a peacekeeping deployment to Darfur, arguing that it could not support the resolution because Sudan's government was not yet ready to accept U.N. peacekeepers on its soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did China oppose the deployment on behalf of Sudan, its Ambassador lobbied hard for the Russians to take the same position. Only under relentless international pressure, with the actress Mia Farrow and others raising the specter that the upcoming Beijing Olympics will become the "Genocide Olympics," has China finally begun to take a few small, constructive steps in the right direction on Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are going to save lives in Darfur, it is imperative that we keep the pressure on China to force Sudan to end the atrocities, resume peace talks and bring resolution to the horror known as Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This very important resolution calls on China to condemn explicitly the atrocities in Darfur, to cease military arms sales, to suspend economic cooperation with Sudan and use its influence to urge President Bashir to comply with full and immediate deployment of the African Union peacekeeping force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also calls on all parties to the conflict to adhere to the ceasefire agreement and allow unfettered access by humanitarian workers to those in need. It's a clear signal to China and Sudan that their relationship cannot and will not withstand the glare of international scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless it wants to permanently scar its reputation, China must act as a responsible world power and use its influence to stop this now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I therefore urge passage and commend the author, my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for her tireless leadership on the Darfur issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also thank our majority leader, Steny Hoyer, for his consistent and effective efforts to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of House Resolution 422, which calls on the government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank my colleague from California, Ms. Barbara Lee, for introducing this important measure, and for all of the cosponsors who she has gathered and their strong and steadfast support of efforts to halt the humanitarian disaster which continues to unfold daily in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor of traveling to the camps of the internally displaced persons in Darfur with Ms. Lee, and I thank her for her courageous leadership in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July 2004, as my good friend from Tennessee stated, the House boldly declared that genocide was occurring in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Nearly 3 years later, the bombing, rape and murder continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes by marauding militias and a callous government bent on total destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while I'm encouraged by the leadership of our United States Government and attempts to end this carnage, I cannot help but feel a profound sense of frustration. Where is the rest of the international community?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Government has provided vital support for the African Union, the United Nations peacekeeping forces. We've led diplomatic efforts to find a political solution to the crisis. We've donated over $2.6 billion in humanitarian assistance for Darfur and Chad since 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just last week the President announced that he would impose tough additional sanctions against key individuals and businesses linked to human rights abuses in the region. Included among those businesses were five major petrochemical companies owned or controlled by the Sudanese regime, and an air transport company transferring arms to fighters in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush also announced that he had directed the U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. to seek passage of a Security Council resolution which would sanction the regime in Khartoum, expand and extend the arms embargo and impose a no-fly zone over Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These measures have been characterized as unhelpful by some, including the Sudanese regime's representatives here in Washington, as well as by Chinese officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's no wonder, Mr. Speaker. As the resolution before us indicates, China purchases up to 70 percent of Sudan's oil. It has $3 billion invested in the energy sector in Sudan, and it has exported at least $24 million in arms and ammunition and another $59 million in aircraft equipment to Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This continues, despite the Sudanese regime's insistence that it can use these funds and equipment for military operations in Darfur; that is, to continue the carnage against Sudanese civilians there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the Chinese leadership appears unwilling to sacrifice its economic interests in Sudan for the sake of humanity. This is unacceptable, and it is also no surprise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beijing must take immediate steps to prevent further death, misery and destruction by compelling the regime in Khartoum to end these atrocities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This means suspending economic cooperation with and stopping all military equipment sales to Sudan until the Sudanese regime stops its assaults on civilians in Darfur, allows the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers, disarms militias, and brings all rebel groups and high-level diplomats together to negotiate a political solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through this resolution we are challenging China as well as other countries who have influence in Sudan to stand with the United States at the United Nations and press for immediate deployment of a robust peacekeeping mission in Darfur as authorized by Security Council Resolution No. 1706. We call on them to support and enforce a rigorous, multilateral sanctions regime against those individuals and businesses which are complicit in genocide. If China and other nations with influence in Sudan  choose to look the other way, then we should reevaluate our relationship with those governments. It should be made clear that governments allied with Khartoum are complicit in a war on civilians and the immeasurable human suffering occurring in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support Ms. Lee's timely resolution, and I take heart in the moral strength that has been demonstrated by this administration, this body, and the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Darfur have known too much suffering with the leaders of the world showing too much procrastination and China showing far too much negligence. The time for action is now. It is long overdue, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from California for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the author of the resolution, Ms. Barbara Lee of California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, for his leadership and support to end the genocide in Darfur, and also let me just thank our chairman, Congressman Lantos; our ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of the Foreign Affairs Committee; and Chairman Payne and the ranking member of the Africa subcommittee, Mr. Smith, for their leadership on the issue of Darfur and for working together to make sure that all of our efforts  here continue to be bipartisan. We have over 128 cosponsors of this resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, thank you to Congressman Jerry Moran of Kansas and also Congressman Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and to all of our staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a mission that we are all on. Many of us have visited on several occasions, and each time we visit Darfur we come back recommitted and rededicated to do what we can each and every day to end this horrific genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirteen years ago, the world stood by as nearly 1 million people, 1 million people, were slaughtered in the genocide in Rwanda. The best our country could do then, unfortunately, was to apologize for our failure to act, and that was after the fact. Many of us swore that another Rwanda would never happen again on our watch. But today, Mr. Speaker, it is happening again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 3 years ago, under the bold leadership of our good friend, Chairman Donald Payne, on July 22, 2004, Congress formally declared that genocide was taking place in Darfur. Estimates indicate that nearly 450,000 people have been killed, and 2.5 million innocent civilians have been displaced to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I witnessed this ongoing tragedy for the first time in 2005 when I visited the refugee camps in Chad and Darfur with two great humanitarian leaders, Don Cheadle and Paul Rusesabagina, this delegation led, again bipartisan, by Chairman Ed Royce. In February, 2006, under the leadership of our great Speaker, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, I had the opportunity once again to visit the refugee camps in another region of Darfur. This again was a bipartisan delegation. And just this past  April, along with my colleague Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, we visited another region in Darfur as part of this visit organized by our majority leader, Steny Hoyer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has said, what we saw in Darfur, of course, is continuing to deteriorate. More and more people are dying, and even humanitarian aid workers are at risk. The day before our delegation arrived, five soldiers from Senegal were killed in Darfur, African Union soldiers there to protect innocent civilians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, for many Darfurians the situation remains grim. Last week, many of us expressed our support for the President's announcement of additional sanctions on businesses controlled by the government of Sudan and on individuals in the Sudanese government. Today, we take another step forward by calling on the Chinese to use their unique influence with Sudan to end the genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no way to sugarcoat this. China is the principal trading partner of a genocidal regime that has thumbed its nose at the international community. China reportedly purchases as much as 70 percent of Sudan's oil and has cancelled over $100 million in debt and has provided $20 million in funding to build a palace for General Bashir. China unquestionably has the unique ability to influence Khartoum in a positive manner, but they cannot do so by simply following a policy of appeasement.  They must put real pressure on General Bashir to comply with all U.N. resolutions and fully, unconditionally accept the U.N.-AU peacekeeping mission. And they must urge Sudan to pursue a renewed peace process with all parties, and they must insist that humanitarian organizations have unfettered access to the 2.5 million people who have been displaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, they should deny Bashir the tools to continue perpetrating the genocide by cutting off, and I mean cutting off, all military arms sales and suspending economic opportunities and cooperation with the government of Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economic costs to China for taking these steps today is minimal compared to the benefit they would achieve if they would provide to the people of Darfur an end to the genocide and the international acclaim that China could win by helping to end the genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge our Chinese friends not to view this resolution as a condemnation but to view it as an opportunity to take action to end an urgent moral and humanitarian crisis. So we are urging the Chinese government to act, and our own steps must increase to stop this horrific and unbelievable tragedy occurring on our watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the Members here who are speaking in support of this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sudan is responsible for the genocide in Darfur. "Genocide" is a fancy term, Mr. Speaker, that means organized murder by a government. The violence has displaced over 2 million people, and it has claimed at least 500,000 lives. President Bush has announced tougher sanctions on businesses and individuals dealing with the government of Sudan, but the perpetrators of evil are also propped up by China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventy percent of Sudan's oil goes to China, and loads of Chinese arms regularly find their way to these demons of the desert. No wonder China is road-blocking change in Sudan. It is all about money and who gets it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the Chinese have appointed envoys, they haven't done anything to pressure the Sudanese to stop murdering their own people. I think it is safe to say, Mr. Speaker, that as long as China continues to prop up the evil in Sudan, the Chinese government is complicit in this atrocity; and I don't think it is too much to ask Congress, in the name of basic human rights, to demand that China use its influence in Sudan to help stop the genocide. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this resolution  offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Chinese have an opportunity to show the world that they care about innocent people and take this blemish off of their historical record. It is in their best interest, not to mention the best interest of the victims of Darfur, that they pressure Sudan to stop the killing of their own people.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would now like to yield 2 minutes to Ms. Shelley Berkley of Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone in this body knows about the atrocities being committed in Darfur. Congress has already labeled them a genocide, and the administration followed suit shortly thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, we passed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, which seeks to give teeth to our declarations and clamp down on the Sudanese government. And yet, despite all of this activity, the horrors continue. The Sudanese regime still has not gotten the message that the United States is serious about stopping the bloodshed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many countries continue to view the situation as "business as usual." China is the largest foreign investor in Sudan and continues to provide the Sudanese blood-soaked government with interest free loans. They are even engaging in arms sales, despite the clear evidence of massacre, rape, destruction, displacement and genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if we are serious about stopping the bloodshed in Sudan, we cannot allow business to continue as usual. The Chinese government and governments throughout the world need to start getting the message: If you continue to invest in murderous, blood-thirsty regimes, if you continue to invest in Sudan, there will be consequences, there will be very serious consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support for this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 4 minutes to a leader in worldwide human rights efforts, Mr. Smith of New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend and colleague for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ms. Lee for introducing <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>, which calls on the government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to stop the atrocities being committed in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure builds on numerous steps that this Congress and the United States Government, through the White House and the executive branch, have taken over the past several years to call a halt to the relentless killings, rapes and displacement of the innocent men, women and children in that region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that Sudan's soil has been soaked in the blood of innocent people. Sudan has not suffered just one, but two genocides. Everybody will recall that in southern Sudan, some two million people were slaughtered by the Bashir government; another 4 million people were displaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Bush came into office, he announced that Senator Danforth would become our special envoy, and very vigorous and robust efforts were made to try to stop the killing in southern Sudan. We succeeded. But after a short period of time new hostilities broke out in the Darfur region in 2003, in February, and the blood-letting was beginning again. Darfur is now the second genocide that has occurred in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should note for the record that no other nation on Earth has done as much as the United States to stop the genocide. Most of the food and the medicines at the refugee camps that my colleagues and I have all visited, looked in the eyes of so many people who have suffered so much, has come from the U.S. taxpayer. I think that should give us some sense of meaning that we have played a significant role in alleviating at least some of this suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, President Bush announced the expansion and tightening of economic sanctions against the Sudanese government. These sanctions include the barring of 30 more companies owned and controlled by the government of Sudan from the U.S. financial system, and it is a crime for Americans to knowingly engage in businesses with these companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is apparent, Mr. Speaker, that more can and must be done by other members of the international community to address these crimes against humanity. A primary culprit is the complicity in this genocide by the People's Republic of China. Instead of joining the international community in calling an end to the genocide, China has served as enabler-in-chief to the atrocities that continue to take place in Darfur. Not only has the Chinese government provided Bashir with funds and weapons, about over</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now we see China's thwarting or attempting to thwart a U.S.-led effort at the U.N. Security Council for a resolution that would impose extended international arms embargo and new sanctions against the Sudanese government. According to Reuters last week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said, "New sanctions against Sudan would only complicate the issue. China appeals to all parties to maintain restraint and patience."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge this spokeswoman and all Chinese officials to go to Darfur and again look into the eyes of those who have suffered, look in the eyes of at least some of the 2 million people who have been displaced from their homes, look into the eyes of some of the families, the survivors of the 450,000 that have been killed and say, "let's look for patience and restraint."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has covered itself in shame. It has enabled two genocides, southern Sudan and now in Darfur. Still, because so many victims are going to be suffering today and tomorrow and the next day, we appeal to the Chinese government, Mr. Speaker, to join us as peacemakers in that troubled region.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee, and I rise in support of this very important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the sponsor of this resolution, the gentlewoman from California, not only for authoring it, but for working with me several weeks ago on an amendment that passed by a bipartisan margin in the House of Representatives to send a message to the leaders of Sudan that we will not tolerate genocide and in fact we will explore the upgrade of the Abeche airbase, which is located 100 miles from the border in Chad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very important resolution. I rise in support of this resolution today because too few people rose in support of those from my faith who were victimized by a holocaust in the 1930s and 1940s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to this body, Mr. Speaker, I made a vow that I would stand up and oppose and fight against and speak out against any genocide, and speak out against any power that was wittingly or unwittingly empowering or assisting in a genocide, which is what brings me to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was recently in China just 2 months ago engaging the Chinese government on a broad range of energy security issues. China has one of the world's fastest growing economies, arguably the world's fastest growing economy. By the year 2030, it will have more cars on its roads than we have on our roads. It is expanding its defense budget. China can be an important partner with the United States in leading the world, but with that role in leading the world comes a responsibility not to empower, not  to assist any kind of genocide. It is time for the leadership of China to stand up with our democracy and say no to the genocide that is occurring in Darfur, and China has a critical opportunity to do that. They purchase 70 percent of Sudan's oil. They invested over $10 million in the Sudanese energy sector over the last two decades. They are the main supplier of arms to Sudan with $83 million exported there in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we want to work with China. We want to engage China. We want to work with China to lead the world in a constructive way on stability and peace and economic development and environmental stewardship, but China needs to show the world that it is willing to engage those who are perpetrating a genocide, to draw the line and say it will not be tolerated. That is precisely what this resolution does. I am very pleased and proud to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from California again for her leadership, and I will continue, with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis, to stand up and speak out when genocide is committed, or against those who assist in the commission of a genocide.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Goodlatte of Virginia, with whom I had the honor of traveling to Darfur on Ms. Lee and Mr. Hoyer's trip to that area recently.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman, and I thank her for her leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this year I had the opportunity to travel with Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, Majority Leader Hoyer and other members of a bipartisan congressional delegation to the war-torn nation of Sudan and see firsthand one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation dedicated to freedom and the rights of the individual, the United States has a responsibility to speak out when those rights are violated. While in Darfur, we saw directly the atrocities in this besieged nation. We toured the Alsalam Internally Displaced Persons Camp, where 47,000 people seeking food, water and safety live in crowded, deplorable and often still unsafe conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is one of nearly 100 such camps which collectively have more than 2 million people. They live in small, makeshift twig huts, many only the size of a pup tent. On numerous occasions, the IDP camps themselves have been attacked. And this is just one of  many examples of the deplorable situation in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that the ongoing crisis in Darfur has led to a major humanitarian disaster. We along with the rest of the world must band together to bring change to this horrible situation. Next year the world will join together to celebrate the Olympic Games. The Olympic spirit brings together nations and people from all over the world in a spirit of peace. The People's Republic of China as the Olympic host country has a profound responsibility to ensure that spirit of peace will be celebrated  throughout the games. However, I am deeply worried that this spirit will be deeply compromised due to China's implicit acquiescence to the atrocities being committed in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The People's Republic of China has a deep relationship with Sudan and has substantial economic investment there. China's connection to Sudan, a country that supports the genocide of its own people, is troubling and seriously undermines the spirit of the Olympic Games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that China is in a position to help improve the situation in Darfur. As an economic partner to Sudan, China must use all means possible to help bring an end to this genocide. As they seek to host the world, they must show the true extent of their leadership and call for an end to this genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 422 rightfully calls on the People's Republic of China to end military and economic assistance to Sudan until Sudan ceases attacking civilians and promotes the humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts going on in Darfur in its own country. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and call on China to fully support the Olympic spirit by calling on Sudan to end the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have never seen anything like what I saw in Darfur, the situation is not completely hopeless. The humanitarian assistance the United States is providing is helping millions of people in desperate circumstances. But we must continue to do more and we must urge the international community to join with us to bring an end to the genocide. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in a bipartisan spirit to bring an end to this international crisis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now am proud to yield the floor to Mr. George Miller from California for 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank all of my colleagues who have spoken on this resolution and certainly to Barbara Lee, my colleague from California, who has been such a not only supporter and the author of this resolution but all of our efforts to change the situation in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor to accompany Congresswoman Lee and our Speaker to Darfur a year ago February and saw the incredible devastation and the brutality and the genocide that is taking place there and vowed to do whatever I can to see if we can change it. I have been wearing this green band to save Darfur for over a year and a half. But this band will not save the people of Darfur, all of my constituents, thousands of my constituents who have marched throughout the Bay area, who have come across  the country to march to save Darfur will not save Darfur. What will save Darfur is the nations of the world owing up to their responsibility to reject this genocide, to stop this genocide, to stop this holocaust against these people and get the government of Sudan to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course today we are here to call upon the nation of China to owe up to its responsibilities, given its huge influence, its economic influence, its military influence, its resource influence in Sudan, to use that influence to get the government of Sudan to start to sit down and to negotiate with all of the parties to end the arms trade that is taking place, to stop the economic engagement until such time as these people in Darfur are once again made safe, until these people in Darfur are once  again allowed to return to their villages, to their families and start to put their lives back together and to end the genocide. That's what is necessary to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague Mr. Goodlatte referred to the Olympics. It's hard to believe that the world is going to look upon the host of the Olympics and see there at the same time a nation that is underwriting a genocide. That is absolutely on a daily basis by its inaction and then by its positive actions underwriting and allowing the genocide to go forward. It's not that China can stop this alone, but in concert with the rest of the nations of the world that have called out for an end to this genocide,  to take actions against the economic activity and the military activity in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Lee has pushed the effort of divestiture that has been followed up in many States and cities and universities and other entities. This has got to continue to stop the genocide that now so many of my colleagues have witnessed firsthand on those terrible, terrible visits to Darfur where we see the worst of humanity and the violence against these individuals and their families and their children. It has got to stop. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this bipartisan  resolution to the floor to help us try and end the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>

Also, I would like to thank and recognize and salute the faith community, because this has been a movement to save Darfur by young people in the faith community. I would just like to mention a few of the organizations that have been unbelievable and unrelenting in their commitment. The Save Darfur Coalition,  and my colleague from California referred to our arm bands, Not on Our Watch, Save Darfur. The Sudan Divestment Task Force. The American Jewish World Service.

    <paragraph>I just want to once again thank Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Chairman Lantos, Mr. Tanner from Tennessee and especially once again Congressman Don Payne for beating the drum, oftentime being a lone voice in the wilderness, but making sure that the rest of the world knew that it is incumbent upon the United States Government to lead to end this genocide and to say again to our country, to the world, not on our watch will this take place. And today we are  taking one more step closer to bringing the world together to ask China to join with us, as Congressman George Miller said, to stop underwriting this genocide that is taking place and to come together now with people and countries of good conscience who stand together to say to General Bashir and the Sudanese government to stop this carnage, to allow the people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A month ago we called upon the League of Arab Nations to do the same thing. And so it's time that the world stand together and say, no more. It's time that we stand together and say to the people of Darfur that hope is coming and that 450,000 people should not have been tolerated, but we don't want to see another single death occur as a result. China has got to help us do this. And so today we are asking the Chinese government in the spirit of cooperation to help stop this genocide that is taking  place.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a little over a year ago, Chairman LANTOS and I protested in front of the Sudanese Embassy about the  continuing genocide in Darfur. I'm privileged to say that I've shared jail time with the distinguished gentleman from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Congresswoman LEE for her leadership on this issue, and I'm honored to be an original cosponsor of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, others have already described the terrible humanitarian crisis affecting the civilian population of Darfur. Crimes against humanity are committed on a daily basis. President Bush and the Congress have determined the systematic killings and deprivations in Darfur constitute acts of genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These serious matters demand a sustained, multilateral response by the United States and the international community. Together, we must pressure the Government of Sudan to stop the killing, stop the arming and support of proxy militias, and negotiate and implement a just and lasting peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Key to the success of such a strategy is the active support of Sudan's major economic and political partners: China, Russia, Malaysia, Egypt and India.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China is Sudan's largest economic partner and its largest provider of military arms and equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China can play a significant, perhaps even decisive, role in ending the genocide in Darfur and convincing Khartoum to negotiate a lasting peace accord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But will it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has taken some steps in the right direction. It supported the deployment of a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force, and recently appointed a special envoy to Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But rather than condemn the violence against defenseless civilians, China's envoy cited poverty as the reason for Darfur's suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did poverty displace over two-and-a-half million people into camps, Mr. Speaker?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did poverty force another half a million to flee the country and live in refugee camps?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited some of these camps in eastern Chad, Mr. Speaker. I saw first-hand how the conflict in Darfur is destabilizing Sudan's neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did poverty burn Darfur's villages to the ground, poison water wells, rape women, murder men, and leave children to die of hunger and thirst?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, Mr. Speaker. The regime sitting in Khartoum has orchestrated and condoned these actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution asks China to acknowledge this violence and use its influence to stop the death and destruction taking place in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To stop selling military arms and equipment to Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To exercise its considerable economic leverage by suspending its economic ties until Khartoum stops the killing, complies fully with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and enters good faith negotiations to end the fighting in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next year, China will host the 2008 Summer Olympics. It has chosen as its theme for the Games a motto filled with hope: "One World, One Dream."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But life in Darfur is no dream, Mr. Speaker. It's an unspeakable nightmare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has the ability to change that reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is, as always, Mr. Speaker, a matter of political will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is China's so-called dream for the world nothing more than a paper banner carried around by a cute and cuddly mascot?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or does China genuinely want to play a responsible role in world and human events and help stop the genocide in Darfur?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are watching, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world is watching, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>, which calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur, Sudan. I traveled to Darfur in February 2006. I will never forget what I saw, nor will I relent in my work to end the ongoing genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China, if it chose to, could play a critical role in ending the genocide in Darfur. The President's Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew S. Natsios, has said that "China's substantial economic investment in Sudan gives it considerable potential leverage, and we have made clear to Beijing that the international community will expect China to be part of the solution." China has a close relationship with the Government of Sudan, economically and militarily. It purchases 70 percent of Sudan's oil. China  has agreed to cancel nearly $100 million if Sudan's debt to the country, and it has invested over $10 million in the Sudanese energy sector over the last two decades. China, already the main supplier of arms to Sudan with $83 million exported there in 2005, recently agreed to cooperate more closely militarily "in every sphere."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this resolution we are asking China to acknowledge and condemn the violence taking place in Darfur, Sudan. Additionally, we are calling on China to cease all military arms and equipments sales to Sudan. Finally, we are strongly encouraging China to suspend economic ties to Sudan until the Government of Sudan stops attacking civilians, complies with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and enters into peace negotiations with rebel groups. China has the ability to end the genocide and horror.  I hope it chooses to act immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>, calling on the People's Republic of China to use their influence and economic leverage with the Government of Sudan to stop the genocide and violence in Darfur. I am proud to join a large number of my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, in cosponsoring this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we stand in serious risk of allowing the ongoing slaughter in Darfur to become one of the blackest marks on humankind's history. This is absolutely unacceptable. It has been nearly 3 years since we in Congress declared that "the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide," a sentiment that has been repeated only recently by President Bush, who went on to say "we have a moral obligation to stop it." Congress has been outspoken in expressing a bipartisan consensus of disgust  at the atrocious human rights abuses committed in the western region of Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Genocide in Darfur continues to play out on our watch. Current estimates put the death toll at 450,000 people, with an additional two million driven from their homes and livelihoods into wandering uncertainty or refugee camps. More than 3.5 million people within Darfur are currently entirely reliant on the international community for the crucial aid that might enable them to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some valuable foundations have been laid. The 22,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 is absolutely necessary to boost the brave but struggling African Union forces already in the region. These U.N. soldiers must be deployed immediately in Sudan, and given unimpeded access to the Darfur region. We must continue to press this issue until U.N. boots are actually on the ground in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To do this, we must step up pressure on China. As the principle export destination of Sudanese oil, China is complicit in the genocide perpetrated by the Sudanese government. However, the immense economic and diplomatic weight wielded by the Chinese government could be used to great effect in ending the killing in Darfur, if applied to that end. It remains my hope that China may be persuaded to provide the type of constructive leadership in Sudan befitting a great power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To this end, this resolution strongly urges China to acknowledge and condemn the atrocities in Darfur, to cease all military arms and related sales, to suspend economic cooperation with the Government of Sudan, and to work to positively influence the Government of Sudan to achieve a number of specific objectives, including the full compliance with Security Council Resolutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As China prepares to host the 2008 Summer Olympics, I believe we should expect China to work to live up to its own Olympic slogan: "One World. One Dream." The time for admirable speeches and impassioned rhetoric, valuable though these are, has passed. The people of Darfur need definitive action and decisive leadership, and they need it now. Now is the moment to seize upon bipartisan common ground, and to work together to respond actively, to fulfill our humanitarian promises, and to finally  help bring an end to this shameful chapter in human history. This bill is an important, definitive, and imaginative step toward this goal, and I commend my colleague for introducing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Darfur continues to burn on our watch. Since the genocide began, we have commemorated both the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide with candles and powerful speeches of regret. We have expressed a bipartisan consensus against the genocide, and yet it continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though we in Congress are currently faced with a number of important and pressing issues vying for our attention, Darfur must be made a priority, and it must remain so until the genocide has ended. I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution aims at encouraging the People's Republic of China to use its influence as one of Sudan's chief purchasers of oil to place pressure on the Sudanese government to improve the conditions for the people in the Darfur region and allow humanitarian organizations to enter the region and assist the people of Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying basis for the conflict in the Darfur region is difficult to define. Some scholars describe it as a conflict between Arab and African cultures, although this is a simplistic  view. Whatever the foundation of the conflict, the Nile Valley region (the area around the Darfur region in Sudan), has had cultural conflicts dating as far back as the fourteenth century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan places the Sudanese military and the Janjaweed militia against rebel groups, including the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. The Sudanese government, while denying its support for the Janjaweed militia, has nonetheless provided funding and weapons to the Janjaweed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of this military conflict, humanitarian aid groups have been unable to reach most parts of the Darfur region. Further, journalists have been prevented from entering the region by the Sudanese government, thus ensuring that many of the atrocities occurring in Darfur go unreported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.N. officials have estimated that over 400,000 Darfur residents have died since the conflict began, many due to starvation. Further estimates put the number of residents displaced from their homes at over 2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that the United States look to any means available to quell the atrocious acts occurring in Darfur. As a leading arms dealer to the country of Sudan, The People's Republic of China is uniquely situated to encourage the Sudanese government to accept the decisions of the United Nations with regard to helping the inhabitants of the Darfur region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As China readies itself for the spotlight on the world stage at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it is important that China, along with the rest of the world, step up its influence on the Sudanese government and ensure that the atrocities and human rights violations taking place in the Darfur region are put to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in support of ending the genocide and violence in Darfur, Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, the international community has paid inadequate attention and devoted insufficient resources to stopping the crisis in Darfur. Although the problems of Sudan lay a long way from our homes, we have learned from the Holocaust in Europe, as well as ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda, that an assault on humanity anywhere is an assault on humanity everywhere. We cannot continue to ignore this genocide without diminishing our own humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am committed to bringing security and relief to the people of Darfur. I have led efforts to encourage state, local, and university divestment of funds from companies that conduct business operations in Sudan. And now I join my colleagues in urging China to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given its economic interests throughout the region, China has a unique ability to positively influence the Government of Sudan to abandon its genocidal policies and to accept the United Nations' peacekeeping mission. To be accepted as a responsible player at the world's diplomatic table, China must end all military and economic assistance to the government of Sudan until Sudan stops overt and covert support for attacks on civilians and engages in meaningful peace negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All members of the international community share a moral obligation to end to the human suffering in Darfur. The situation is dire, but I am confident that we can all do our part to help stop this genocide and bring peace and stability to millions of innocent men, woman, and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Calling on the People's Republic of China to use its influence to help stop the genocide in Sudan is the right thing to do. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>, which calls on China to use its leverage with the government of Sudan to end the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan already is believed to have caused the deaths of almost half a million people. More than 200,000 people have been killed by Sudanese Government forces and armed militias since 2003, and another 200,000 people have died as a result of the deliberate destruction of homes, crops and water supplies and the resulting conditions of famine and disease. Over one-third of the population of Darfur has been displaced, and the United Nations estimated that  almost 250,000 people have been displaced in the past 6 months alone, due primarily to government-sponsored militia attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China, unlike most nations in the international community, has cultivated a close relationship with the Government of Sudan. China maintains close military ties with Sudan and purchased almost $2 billion worth of Sudanese oil last year. China also has cancelled $100 million in Sudanese debt and provided an additional $20 million to finance the construction of a presidential palace in the capital city. As a result, China is in a unique position to put pressure on the Government of Sudan to stop  the violence in Darfur. So far, it has failed or refused to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution urges China to acknowledge and condemn the atrocities in Darfur, cease all weapons sales to Sudan, and suspend economic cooperation with Sudan. The resolution also urges China to use its leverage to influence the Government of Sudan to: comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions providing for disarmament of militias in Darfur and deployment of a full-scale peacekeeping force; participate in peace negotiations to secure a legitimate peace agreement between all parties;  and improve working conditions for humanitarian organizations operating in Sudan and ensure they have access to the 2.5 million people displaced by this genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I urge China to join with the international community and take a stand against genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill>, which calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to stop the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The violence in Darfur grows more gruesome by the day. I led the first congressional delegation to Darfur in 2004 with Senator Sam Brownback, and I have personally witnessed the nightmare there with my own eyes. Every day that passes, more men are killed, more women are raped, and more children die of malnutrition. This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people in Darfur have lost their homes, their livelihoods, their loved ones. They have seen unspeakable horrors, carried out by the genocidal National Islamic Front in Khartoum and their cruel compatriots, the Janjaweed militia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. and the international community have made strong efforts to halt the violence in Darfur, and have provided significant levels of humanitarian support to the victims of this genocide. However, these efforts have largely failed to stop the NIF's desire to complete their campaign in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chinese Government's destructive role in the region is partly to blame for the continuing violence in Darfur. A recent Amnesty International report showed that China is making the conflict worse by providing weapons to the Sudanese Government to carry out the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Hu visited Khartoum in February, instead of using his influence to persuade Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to stop the violence in Darfur, he promised to build Bashir a brand new palace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Hu appointed a new special envoy to Darfur, the envoy came back from the region claiming that the "final solution" for Darfur lies with removing "mistrust" between the Sudanese Government and the United States. He said the violence in Darfur is limited to sporadic conflicts along the border with Chad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has used its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to repeatedly obstruct efforts by the U.S. and the U.K. to introduce peacekeepers to curtail the slaughter. Beijing is uniquely positioned to put a stop to the slaughter, yet they have so far been unabashed in their refusal to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China, which is a major business partner of Sudan, should be using its influence with the Sudanese Government to bring an end to the violence in Darfur. China's role in extracting oil from Sudan and maintaining close business relations with this genocidal regime are clearly more important to the Chinese Government than saving human lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution calls on the Chinese Government to use its influence to stop the violence in Darfur. It urges China to push the Sudanese Government to accept a hybrid peacekeeping force, to disarm the Janjaweed militia, and to join the international community in imposing economic sanctions on Sudan if the government continues to support attacks on civilians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this resolution. A critical part of our efforts on Darfur is pressing the Chinese Government to stop supporting the genocide there. China must begin playing a constructive role in the region.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="422">H. Res. 422</bill> to call on the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to halt the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As hundreds of thousands have died at the hands of government-backed militias in Darfur, China, and Sudan have cultivated a mutually beneficial relationship that provides crucial energy resources to China in return for thwarting international efforts to sanction the Khartoum government and deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China and Sudan have extensive economic, political, and military ties. China is Sudan's largest foreign investor and purchases two-thirds of Sudanese oil exports. China has sold arms to the Sudanese military and in February cancelled $80 million in Sudanese debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it can do much more, China has taken some steps to alleviate the suffering in Darfur. Last November, China helped negotiate the agreement at Addis Abba which called for the deployment of a joint United Nations/African Union peacekeeping force. In May, China appointed a Special Envoy to Sudan and pledged $5.1 million in humanitarian aid to Darfur. Yet these positive steps are far outweighed by China's continuing support for the genocidal regime in Khartoum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless China acts to pressure the Khartoum government into accepting a U.N. peacekeeping force, China risks having the 2008 Beijing Olympics forever known as the genocide Olympics. China must condemn the violence taking place in Darfur, halt all military arms sales to Sudan, and suspend economic ties to Sudan until the Government of Sudan stops attacking civilians, complies with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and enters into peace negotiations with rebel groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As China rises as a power in the 21st century, it must realize that with its increased power comes a greater responsibility to take action to stop genocide.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The world must be united in its call for an end to genocide. As China seeks to enter onto the world stage as a global economic and diplomatic power, the government must assume the responsibility, as well as the benefits that accompany this distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China must use its close economic and military ties and advise the Sudanese government that genocide is very bad for business. Congress and the world are watching.
