  <narrative>SENATORS DOMENICI AND KENNEDY AND APPROPRIATIONS BILLS -- (Senate - October 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12832">S12832</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me commend the majority leader for his comments about our colleague, Senator Domenici's long and extraordinarily distinguished career. We are indeed fortunate he will be here for another 15 months and we look forward to serving with him. I will have, obviously, a lot more to say about his remarkable tenure in the Senate later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also good to have a health update on our colleague Senator Kennedy, and to learn his operation went well and he is doing well and will be back with us soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me underscore the observations the majority leader made. It is our goal to pass as many of the appropriations bills as possible. There will be significant cooperation on this side of the aisle toward that end. That is, after all, the basic work of Government, and we need to try to complete it as rapidly as possible.</paragraph>
