    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride in congratulating Chillicothe, Ohio, our great State's first capital, in being named Ohio's Best Hometown in the November issue of Ohio Magazine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A small town rich in history and nestled within the beautiful foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in southern Ohio, Chillicothe represents the very embodiment of everything that's right about middle America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, the city has gone through an impressive transformation. It has completed a large expansion of its high school. Adena Hospital is consistently ranked as one of the top rural hospitals in the country. And the OU-Chillicothe campus has grown by over 25 percent in the last 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More and more people are discovering what we have known for a long time, that southeastern Ohio and southern Ohio and towns like Chillicothe offer a great place to live and a great place to raise a family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate Mayor Joe Sulzer and the rest of my friends in Chillicothe on this great honor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
