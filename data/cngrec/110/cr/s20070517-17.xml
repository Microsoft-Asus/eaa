    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say we have had some really good work this week in the Senate. When I came here on Monday and indicated we would have to work into the weekend, that wasn't just for fluff. I really thought we would have to do that because we had so much to do. We were heavily involved in WRDA, a bill that was so important to be done, but a lot of hiccups come in complex legislation like that. We were able to finish that in a few days. I was concerned about the budget and the time  limits that are statutory in that regard. We completed that. I was concerned about the supplemental, getting something to the House, which was a tremendously difficult job. We were able to get that done. Finally, there has been an agreement in principle on immigration, which we will take up, I hope, Monday evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any one of these things gives no bragging rights to Democrats or Republicans, but it gives bragging rights to Democrats and Republicans because none of this could have been done but for the recognition that you have to work together to get things done. There is no better example of that--and I said it briefly on the floor yesterday--than Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe. They are really two political opposites in most everything. But they are also experienced legislators, both  having served in the House and in the Senate. Senator Boxer is chairman of the committee now, and Senator Inhofe was chairman of the committee. Senator Inhofe knew how important WRDA is. He worked together with Senator Boxer, and vice versa, and they got that done. That is tremendously good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the budget, I boast about the managers all the time because I think they work well together--Senators CONRAD and GREGG. What they were able to piece together with this budget was very difficult. It wasn't mechanical, but it was difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the supplemental, I give a little credit to me, a little credit to Senator McConnell, and the rest of the credit to the Senate because we were able to get that done and get a bill to conference with the House. We have had a number of meetings with the President's chief of staff--Senator McConnell and I, Speaker Pelosi, and other representatives of the President. We hope to be able to complete that very important conference report by next week at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, on the immigration issue, at this stage, I have kept this to myself, but Senator McConnell was one of those who urged me to stick to my timeline, stick to the 2 weeks. He said, "If we are going to get anything done, you have to set a time limit." We did that. I don't know if the immigration legislation will bear fruit and we will be able to pass it. At least we have something to talk about as a legislative vehicle on the floor that is bipartisan in nature. You may not agree  on the respective parts, but that can be debated. We are going to start Monday night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I mention that this evening is all Senators and all staffs  are watching. The players on that--Senators Specter, Leahy, Kennedy, Kyl, and others--have recognized they are going to have to work into the night. If we are going to finish this bill next week, we are going to have to work nights, and that doesn't mean 6:30 at night. We have one Senate event that we are locked into Tuesday evening, but that doesn't  mean the managers cannot work while we do that. It is an event at the Botanical Gardens for Senators. So we are going to work long, hard hours to complete that most important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, this was a very good week for the Senate and for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a lot more weeks like this, and we hope to do that in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I can add briefly, I commend the majority leader for this week. I think we did have a good week. I am particularly pleased that we seem to be on a glidepath to completion of the important troop funding bill. There is a bipartisan agreement we need to have a signed bill providing funding for the troops before Memorial Day, and the distinguished majority leader and myself, and the President's representative, Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, have been working  toward that end and will continue to do that tomorrow in an additional meeting with the Speaker and Leader Boehner from the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, am pleased a bipartisan agreement on immigration appears to be coming together. On the day I was elected Republican leader, I said I hope this Congress will do two important things that will make a difference for our country. I thought the divided Government was uniquely situated to tackle both of these issues. One of them was Social Security. I am not as optimistic on that issue as I would like to be. And the other issue is immigration. There is reason for optimism today that the Senate,  on a bipartisan basis, will come together and pass a landmark piece of legislation. We will find out next week, but I think the compromise announced today certainly gives room for optimism that might occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did support the majority leader's decision to turn to that issue before Memorial Day. I thought it gave us the best chance of passing legislation, and with those kinds of deadlines, it gave us the best chance of coming together. Hopefully, that process of coming together was achieved earlier today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
