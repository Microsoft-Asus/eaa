  <narrative>RESULTS OF NOT DEVELOPING AMERICAN ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4881]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400005" topic="">
    <paragraph>As America is becoming painfully aware, there has been a result of us not developing American energy. We have reports of police cars sitting idle because of the cost of gasoline; various assembly lines and automobile manufacturers closed down because of the fact that there's no demand for the type of vehicles that are being produced. We have a situation where parents have a hard time just putting enough gasoline in the tank to get the kids to school. And we have the AAA saying that  the increase in motorists without gas has increased 15 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Speaker Pelosi took office, gasoline prices have skyrocketed 71 percent. Now, I am an engineer. The good news is there's a solution to this. It's called American energy. We need to stop looking at the American energy as something that is an environmental hazard and rather look at it as an asset that we can develop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats, year after year after year, 85 percent of the time, are voting against increasing supplies of American energy. We have to develop our own energy.</paragraph>
