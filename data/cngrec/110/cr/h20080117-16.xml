  <narrative>WORKING IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER TO STAVE OFF IMPENDING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H299]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, one year into a liberal Democratic majority in Congress, the economy is struggling. The big government policies of the new majority are taking their toll. High gasoline prices, the subprime market crisis in housing and news that inflation is at a 17-year high all demand a bipartisan stimulus package in the next 30 days. Congress must act, and must act swiftly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there will be choices to make. Democrats want an extension of unemployment insurance benefits and tax rebates. Republicans will accept rebates, but they also want incentives for businesses, while avoiding tax increases to offset the package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit that Congress must focus stimulus on the kind of economic stimulus that will create jobs and growth for small business and family farmers. The real antidote to the impending recession is more money in the hands of the wage earner and the wage payer. This is and always has been the pathway to prosperity in the American economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to work in a bipartisan manner to stave off this impending economic downturn in the best interests of all of the American people.</paragraph>
