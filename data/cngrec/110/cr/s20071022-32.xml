  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, we have said we would finish the bill by 12:30 tomorrow. That may be difficult to do. I am disappointed, but I know everybody is working in good faith. I accept the distinguished Republican leader at his word that the bill will be completed sometime tomorrow afternoon. We are making progress. We have a number of things going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican leader knows what I am going to do as soon as we finish the Labor-HHS bill--appoint conferees, and it will go to conference, and we will bring that back as quickly as we can. He knows what I am moving to after that bill is finished.</paragraph>
