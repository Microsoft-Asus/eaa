    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this morning I come to the floor of this House to honor Army Sergeant Chris Davis. Sergeant Davis died Saturday defending liberty in Iraq. Serving in the United States Army was a life-long dream for Sergeant Davis. His 8 years in the Army included four tours of duty in Iraq. His devotion to America's security earned him numerous medals for his achievement, service and defense of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Lubbock, Texas, Chris was a brave soldier, a devoted husband and a loving father. This morning, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family: His parents, Ray and Hermina, his three sisters, his wife, Debbie, the children, Kasey, Blade, Jacob, Taylor and Dillon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate this Fourth of July week, may we remember the sacrifices of many that have gone before us and particularly this young brave soldier, Sergeant Davis from Lubbock, Texas.</paragraph>
