  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, with my enthusiastic support, the House passed the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, <bill type="h" number="6331">H.R. 6331</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Cochise County, which is a rural part of my southern Arizona district, access to primary health care is a real challenge, but it is a challenge that particularly impacts our seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation protects payments for community physicians, for critical hospitals and for ambulances in rural areas. In southern Arizona, these doctors and hospitals provide vital services to our seniors throughout a very rural part of America, including areas like Naco, Sierra Vista, Douglas, and Bisbee, Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to thank members of my senior advisory council and my health care advisory council. They have worked diligently to highlight the need for improving access to health care for our seniors, especially in underserved and remote areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday was a good day in the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take swift action this week to also pass this legislation and to send it to the President.</paragraph>
