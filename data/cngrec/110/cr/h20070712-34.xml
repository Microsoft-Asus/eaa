    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007. As you know, I introduced <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> on March 29, 2007. I want to thank each of my colleagues, both on the Committee on Financial Services and in the House, who have joined with me to see that this important legislation passes the House. I especially want to thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK for his leadership, Ranking Member JUDY BIGGERT, and CHRISTOPHER SHAYS for their original cosponsorship  and support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been less than 2 months since the Committee on Financial Services considered major reforms to the section 8 program. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, which passed the Committee on Financial Services by a vote of 52-9, is truly the culmination of work that began in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many Members of Congress who have expressed major concerns to me about the future stability of the section 8 voucher program, given the recent changes in the funding formula and its impact on tenants. This bill addresses many of those problems and will return much needed stability to the section 8 program and the 2 million low-income families who rely upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, public housing agencies, national housing interest groups and advocates, and other housing experts about the importance of reforming the section 8 program. While there is consensus that the section 8 program needed to be reformed, HUD disagrees on how to reform the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National housing organizations like the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities which represent those directly affected by the change in the funding formula agree that basing the funding for a program as important as the voucher program on data that is 3 years old is just simply bad policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress changed how we paid public housing authorities for vouchers under lease. Instead of paying the actual cost of the voucher, the decision was made to pay for what the  voucher cost during a 3-month period in the previous year. This had disastrous consequences for PHAs. Many saw a cut in their funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While section 8 recipients had to bear the brunt of this policy change as waiting lists closed, many low-income families who had been waiting for affordable housing for years suddenly found housing denied to them. Because of cost concerns, some families were denied their right to move to areas that may have been a bit more expensive but had better job and educational opportunities. Some families saw an increase in rent as many PHAs scrambled to cut costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As families struggled under this formula, so did some of our Nation's largest PHAs. The snapshot funding system had consistently and has consistently underpaid some PHAs to the benefit of others. Because of the funding instability, these PHAs had no reason to house more families. As a result, housing authorities are sitting on $1.4 billion in unspent voucher funds. This nonuse of our voucher dollars is unacceptable because we have lost 150,000 vouchers as a direct result of the funding formula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, this formula must be changed for the good of public housing agencies and the families they serve. HUD is just wrong in this issue. I flatly reject their just-released statement of policy on the bill. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> updates the voucher formula by basing funding for vouchers on the previous year's leasing and cost data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The use of more accurate data will ensure that we stop overpaying and underpaying PHAs for vouchers, but instead come as close as we can to paying the actual cost of the voucher. This will enable HUD to better control costs than the section 8 voucher program. This funding approach was recently embraced by both Houses of Congress in <bill type="hj" number="20">H.J. Res. 20</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vouchers are a scarce resource, but are even scarcer since the funding formula changed in 2004. Only one out of four families who are eligible for housing assistance, including vouchers, actually receive it. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> provides PHAs with several resources for increasing the number of families they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill provides for the recapture and redistribution of most unspent voucher funds for housing agencies that have chosen not to use these dollars to PHAs that are capable and willing to spend them. This reallocation system will provide PHAs with an incentive to house more families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill provides tools for PHAs to pay for increased costs or emergencies without having to cut assistance to families or to request new funding from the HUD or the Congress. The bill allows PHAs to retain up to a 1-month reserve in the formula's first year. For those PHAs that need additional funds, the bill allows them to borrow up to 2 percent of their budget authority, to be repaid within the first 3 months of the following year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill provides an authorization of appropriation for 20,000 new incremental vouchers per year for 5 years. Congress has not authorized new vouchers since 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this period, we all know that the need for voucher assistance has grown, not declined. We are not meeting the need for housing vouchers for very low-income persons in this country, working families, the disabled and elderly. Additional vouchers are needed to make sure that the voucher program continues to keep up with the ever-expanding need for affordable housing in this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the bill provides incentives for PHAs to increase families served by tying administrative funding to the number of families housed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, the bill restores housing choice, an important feature of the voucher program which has been lost because of cost concerns. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> would eliminate the complex billing process between PHAs using portable vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a bill that will restore stability and predictability to the Nation's largest</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal housing program by fixing the broken funding formula. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> provides for the needs of the families, public housing agencies and landlords who participate in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding formula, however, is not the only aspect of the section 8 program in need of reform. Today, housing agencies and program recipients must deal with the complicated set of rules for the determination of rent, recertification of income and inspection of housing units. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> simplifies those requirements, while maintaining current affordable standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> also includes tools to encourage voucher families to move to economic self-sufficiency. Families should not have to pay more in rent because they want to work to provide for their families. By disregarding a portion of earned income, <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> would protect families from any resultant increases in rent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families also shouldn't be penalized for pursuing educational opportunities. Currently, many families in the voucher and public housing programs can find themselves excluded from work and economic opportunities because of a lack of credit history or low credit scores. The bill would allow the Department to work with the Nation's credit bureaus to allow for the reporting of the rental payment history of voucher and public housing recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill will increase homeownership opportunities for voucher families by allowing them to use a section 8 voucher to make a down payment on their first home. Importantly, the bill provides for a change to the funding structure for family self-sufficiency coordinated to ensure that families have the tools to take advantage of these opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without going into all of what is taken care of and what is reformed, I have tried to share the major reforms that we have created for our families who will be receiving assistance through the section 8 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like first to thank all of my colleagues and their staffs from both sides of the aisle for working to craft a bipartisan section 8 reform bill that we are considering today. In particular I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters for their hard work, committee Ranking Member Bachus for his support, and the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Shays, who joined me as an original cosponsor of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan bill that passed out of our committee by a vote of 52-9. It is similar to the section 8 reform bill that then Chairman Oxley moved through the Financial Services Committee during the last Congress. It was a bipartisan bill then too, passing out of the committee by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The section 8, or Housing Choice Voucher Program, is the major Federal program helping the elderly, the disabled and the very low-income families find affordable housing in the private market. Today's housing vouchers are the primary tool of assistance provided under section 8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues served in this body when housing vouchers were first proposed and implemented under a Republican administration, that of President Reagan. The Section 8 Voucher Program was designed to move people away from large concentrated housing projects, like our Cabrini-Green or Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. It allows individuals to make decisions about where they want to live, instead of forcing them to live in large public housing projects filled with crime, poverty and despair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the colleagues on my side of the aisle, I should admit, quite frankly, that this bill is better than I expected it to be. We have been able to get several key issues addressed in this bill that were not addressed in last year's Republican legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Waters, who coauthored with me a manager's amendment that the committee accepted during our markup that includes a number of provisions to increase the flexibility of project-based section 8 vouchers. It amended section 8 of the law regarding the use of vouchers to purchase manufactured homes, voucher reserves, portability, performance assessment, disabled vouchers and rent levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am pleased that included in this bill is language that is identical to the Family Self-Sufficiency Act, or FSS, a bill that I introduced as a stand-alone measure. This  bill enhances HUD's FSS program by providing housing authorities with consistent coordinator funding. Housing authorities can then help more individuals move from public assistance to being self-sufficient homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most important for Members on my side of the aisle is that this bill includes a significant expansion of Moving to Work, or the MTW program. Members on both sides of the aisle have public housing authorities in their district that seek to become Moving to Work housing authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, DuPage Housing Authority would like this status. However, to date, Congress has only authorized 32 housing authorities to be MTWs. During the committee markup, we increased the authorization to a total of 80, which is a remarkable achievement. In addition, the Moving to Work provisions in this bill require HUD to craft standards that will govern eligibility requirements from being considered and/or designated as a Moving to Work authority. This bill includes important tenant protections  that make the MTW Program better than it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am also pleased that we included a provision that will measure the success of the program. Congress created the Moving to Work program in 1996, but it does not require HUD to establish standards and evaluate agencies' performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now granted, the administration does not support this bill, nor did it support the Oxley bill last year or in the previous Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Well, because in their view, it does not reform the program enough. They believe it moves the program from one that is currently budget based to a unit-based system that Mr. Knollenberg spoke about earlier. But I think that point is subject to interpretation. And politics is the art of the possible; and absent this bill, no reform is possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does not include everything that I wanted either. The section 8 funding formula my colleagues will recall was changed in the CR earlier this year. I have on several occasions offered amendments in committee to address this formula change, and we did include in the manager's amendment a provision that will provide PHAs a cushion in the transition year so they are not penalized for CR formula change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there is more work to be done. There are 1,200 PHAs. Half of those across the country do not suffer from unjustified and significant funding cuts as a result of the new section 8 funding formula included in the CR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank has agreed to engage in a colloquy with me about this, and I look forward to doing that in a few moments. I hope we will continue to work together as we continue to address the continued shortcomings of this formula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill and one deserving of our support, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield Chairman Frank such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman, not so much for yielding but for the really extraordinary work she has done on this, the gentlewoman from California, and I want to say how much I admire the two tracks she has worked on. On the one track, she has been one of the leaders on our side in the House on the issue of Iraq and ending our involvement in the war in Iraq where I am a strong follower of her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simultaneously, she has engaged in some very careful and thoughtful legislative work, and I think that is the mark of a complete legislator, to be able to do the ideologically based advocacy but also work in a bipartisan way, continuing work which began when she was the ranking member and in a seamless way to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke during the rule where I expressed my strong support for the legislation. I have rarely seen legislation so broadly supported by the landlords, by the local housing authorities that administer it and by the beneficiaries. There is a three-way operation here, and all of them consider this bill to be an improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentlewoman from Illinois said, it does not improve everything as much as everybody would like; nothing ever does. But she is correct, this is an improvement. I would ask my friend from California to yield to her so we can talk about it, but she has already done some of the things that she talked about. For instance, in the manager's amendment, we will increase the reserves available to housing authorities to avoid any damage that would come in the transition on the new funding formula.  I know the gentlewoman has some other concerns, and I hope if the gentlewoman from California will yield to her, I can respond to them.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman, and I would like to engage in a colloquy with Chairman Frank at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank, as you may recall, the section 8 funding formula was changed through provisions in the continuing resolution. I did not support these changes because they did cut about 1,500 public housing authority slots in three counties in my congressional district. And as Chairman Frank can verify, I have on several occasions offered amendments to change this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the manager's amendment includes a provision which addresses this problem. While I am pleased that we can take productive steps towards addressing the shortcomings, I believe we can do more as we move on, and it is my understanding that members of the Appropriations Committee have included a similar provision in the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Appropriations bill. Would the chairman consider supporting this?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>The gentlewoman has stated this correctly. I know this is going to be in the appropriations bill. We expect it. I haven't seen the appropriations bill yet. I have great confidence in the subcommittee chairman, but I certainly agree with her in principle. And unless there is some very unusual wording which we could change, yes, I would be subject to saying, yes, that is exactly what we intend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again regarding the rebenchmarking, both the current formula and the one in this bill would base a PHA's annual funding level on a "snapshot" of the PHA's use of funds from the previous 12 months. However, I continue to be concerned that his annual benchmarking is unworkable when coupled with the congressional budget cycle. For this reason, I hope we can continue to work together as we move forward to address the continued shortcomings of this formula. PHAs have always stated and continue to  argue that their main concern is to have predictability and certainty in funding so they can plan both voucher utilization and staffing. I know they would appreciate more predictability. If the snapshot and the rebenchmarking were done every other year, would the chairman continue to explore with me the benefits of a biennial versus annual rebenchmarking?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>The answer is, again, yes. This is a very important subject which the gentlewoman from Illinois has identified. I promise we will work together. If we decide this needs to be a legislative change, I can promise the gentlelady that the committee will entertain the appropriate legislation and do that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I would like to ask the chairman to consider other measures to assist PHAs in the transition period and in the subsequent years. For example, I would like the chairman to consider a so-called hold-harmless provision attached to the new section 8 formula. The provision would provide PHAs with an assurance that they would not lose more than a certain percentage of funds in any given year due to the utilization rates in the previous years. The reasons for this are many, but at the heart  of the matter is the simple fact that the so-called excess in funds that many PHAs were caught with when the new formula was dropped into the CR were not in fact excess at all but the result of deliberate choices, court-ordered requirements or special set-aside categories of  vouchers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>The answer here is definitely yes. I think a hold-harmless provision is appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the change, as the gentlewoman knows, in our mind was to prevent a kind of downward ratcheting in the overall usage. But consistent with that, we don't want to penalize particular authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already done some work, for instance, with the Dade County authority to take into account the fact that their shortfall came because of a hurricane, so they were not penalized by that. But the hold-harmless provision is a perfectly reasonable one, and I agree with the gentlewoman. I promise to work with the gentlewoman to do whatever we need to do legislatively to accomplish it.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something we have been working on for years, and I am pleased we have it to this point today. I commend Chairman Frank. Barney, you have been great to work with on these issues. When we express concerns, he is always willing to look at policy rather than politics. We have arrived at a bill we can all look at and say, there are things we might change, but overall, we all agree it is a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Ranking Member Bachus for all of his help and assistance. Chairman Waters, it has been fun working with you on this issue, as well as Ranking Member Biggert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working together in a bipartisan manner, we have produced a bill that will help the section 8 program better serve families and communities across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Congress has grappled with the skyrocketing cost of the section 8 program, which is growing so rapidly that HUD's other programs are suffering as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not feasible for the Federal Government to continue increasing funds for a program without enacting meaningful reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress, I introduced legislation to improve the delivery of housing assistance to families in need by providing flexibility to local public housing authorities, PHAs, and holding them accountable for results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of my legislation was to ensure that PHAs would serve as many families as possible within their budget. While the bill before us today does not go as far as my proposal in injecting flexibility to PHAs in their administration of the entire section 8 program, <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> does make a number of improvements to the section 8 program to reform the simplified regulations for local housing agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Chairman Frank's willingness to work with me to allow for PHA innovation on a scale he is more comfortable with. While the bill before us does not apply flexibility to the entire program, I am pleased it at least allows a permanency and expansion of the Moving To Work program, renamed in this bill as the Housing Innovation Program, HIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Moving to Work Program has allowed a small group of PHAs to create locally based housing programs outside of HUD's one-size-fits-all regulations. The program has enabled PHAs to create jobs for residents, add affordable housing stock and help families build savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, over 24 of the more than 3,000 PHAs nationwide are participating in the Moving to Work program. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> provides access to more agencies nationwide seeking MTW status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the new HIP program, we will be able to take away "best practices" to apply to the entire section 8 program in the future. I am confident that the innovation that will be produced through the flexibility provided in the HIP will demonstrate ways to truly reform section 8 so we can serve more families efficiently and help move them to self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment, which will be debated later this evening, includes language I crafted to provide PHAs with the flexibility to establish rent structures as they see best to address the needs of their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language gives PHAs the flexibility to select from a menu of tenant rent policies, including flat rent, rents based on income ranges, rents based on percentage of income, or other innovative rent policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HUD and many PHAs agree that the current Federal approach to tenant rent contribution is a regressive system that penalizes residents by charging higher rents for those who gain employment and income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If a section 8 recipient's salary increases, so does their rent. This creates a disincentive for work. Our goal should be to provide a helping hand to those who need it but also ensure that they are on a path to self-sufficiency. Rather than providing incentives for work, the current section 8 program provides incentives for people to lie about their income or to reject opportunities to increase their income since they would be forced to pay more rent. I don't think this is a message we should  be sending in this program. We should be instilling responsibility and desire to achieve in our housing assistance policy, not encouraging dishonesty and creating disincentives for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased the chairman has worked with me on language to allow PHAs the option of setting rents in innovative ways to help families achieve self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is that we face a situation of growing waiting lists for section 8 vouchers without the resources to serve everyone. The answer is not to merely throw more money into an existing regressive system in a department where there are other pressing needs that need to be met. We need to move current section 8 recipients to self-sufficiency by allowing PHAs to be innovative with the money they do have, to be efficient and help as many people in need move through the program as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill does not go as far as I think we need it to go in terms of allowing flexibility, I believe it is a step in the right direction and will make needed improvements to the section 8 program. I look forward to the debate on the amendments tonight as I believe we can continue to improve the legislation as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There seems to be a misunderstanding on the part of HUD. Mr. Frank, this bill includes a revision and expansion of the Moving to Work Program, MTW, renamed the Housing Innovation Program, HIP. Under the program authority of HIP, the Secretary may designate up to 60 public housing agencies to fully participate in the program, and an additional 20 public housing agencies may participate in the program under what is called the HIP-Lite provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current MTW program, authorization has been granted for 32 public housing authorities to participate in the program. However, HUD narrowly defined the legislative authority under which they could solicit new applications. HUD decided that once PHAs leave the program, no new agencies can be selected to fill their vacancy. The result is, out of 32 authorized, only 24 agencies are currently in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to confirm that the intent of this bill is to allow HUD to solicit new applications in order to maintain the program at its fully authorized level and to give PHAs the opportunity to fill any vacancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to confirm that you agree that the secretary of HUD should promptly solicit new applications from PHAs interested in participating in the HIP program whenever the number of agencies is less than the total authorized level, and that would be 60 under this bill; is that correct, sir?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California is absolutely correct. The alternative interpretation would make no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, HUD should have and does have the authority to select replacements. What we set was a maximum number of participating agencies, and if an agency withdraws, then a new agency should be replaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I may, I should note that the chairman of the subcommittee, who is such a devoted supporter of fairness, has raised some questions about the Moving to Work program, or whatever the new name is, and I have spoken with her. And I think what would be appropriate, and I think we would all agree, when we return from the summer recess to have a hearing on how the Moving to Work program is, in fact, operating, and I think that would be an appropriate thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But certainly under this law and under the agreements we reached, we set a number of housing authorities that are eligible to participate, and there shouldn't be any question, if an authority drops out, then HUD has the obligation, not just the permission, but the obligation to replace it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So HUD understands, if it does drop to 50, it should be moved up promptly to 60, and I look forward to the hearing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'd like to thank the chairwoman, my friend from California, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairwoman and I came to this Congress on the very same day in 1990, and I'm extremely proud of the work she's done on this bill and gratified to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially want to thank her for including language that I think will help underdogs, and the chairwoman has been a friend of the underdog for a very long time, and in her work in Sacramento she achieved her visions where tenants who were being mistreated by landlords, where the property was not being properly kept up and was not habitable, would be given the option of withholding rent in order to force repairs on the property. She's taken that provision and extended that principle in this  bill in a way for which I salute her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill contains provisions that say in situations where a public housing authority chooses, when notified of serious code violations by a tenant, it may take actions to withhold part of the section 8 voucher payment that would otherwise go to the landlord. And the purpose of this would be to empower the public housing authority under certain circumstances to deduct that amount of money and pay for the repairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does this mean? It means a powerless person who doesn't have a political action committee or a lobbyist or a lot of political power but who needs their sink fixed or a broken window repaired or a heater repaired for the first time is going to have sufficient leverage to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this will have three very important effects. First, it will be fair and right for these tenants. Second, it will be fair for landlords. If the tenant is the cause of the problem or if a landlord is acting responsibly, this poses no burden on a landlord. And third, it will help responsible local officials prevent blight and degradation of certain neighborhoods so that each person can live in an environment that's proper and good for their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the chairwoman for her characteristic advocacy on behalf of the underdog, for taking this idea, and I would urge support of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price), a member of the committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend from Illinois for yielding, and I want to thank also the Chair of the committee and Chair of the subcommittee for the work that they have done on this, and the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to express a few sincere and serious concerns with section 9 of the bill. This is the section that allows the public housing authorities, or the PHAs, to report the rental payments of its tenants to credit reporting agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reporting alternative data, like rental payments, to the credit reporting agencies may indeed be a very good thing. The hope obviously is that increased alternative data will help improve the credit reports for consumers and, in the long run, provide them with better and less expensive access to credit. In this increasingly credit-drive society, that's truly an important thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I've got four specific concerns with the way that the language in section 9 of this bill is written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First is the format that this data will take. The language of the underlying bill requires the PHAs and credit reporting agencies to establish a system and format for reporting the new data. This is obviously new territory for PHAs, and they haven't done it before and aren't financial institutions and have no history of providing reporting data in the proper format.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second concern is that this section may be incorrectly read to constitute a new requirement on the credit reporting agencies, and I would submit that this would be a drastic and significant change to our current system. Currently, credit reporting agencies must consider the timeliness of the data supplied to them. They must verify that it is accurate data, ensure that there hasn't been any case of identity fraud so that false data is not included in an unsuspecting consumer's credit file. Rental  payment, clearly that information is different than other forms of commerce, and it may need to be treated differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A third concern is that the section, as it reads, would apply to "families receiving tenant-based housing choice vouchers." Credit files historically are unique to individuals. Credit reporting agencies have no way to adjust their credit files for an entire family. So I wonder again sincerely what the real consequences of this ambiguity and potentially harmful aspect are to spreading potential financial responsibility to some without regard to accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My fourth concern may be the most important, and that is, that the underlying legislation requires that the PHA, or the public housing agency, gain the permission of the family in writing before submitting the data to credit reporting agencies. This provision potentially would turn our credit reporting system on its head. It's a 100-year-old system based on the voluntary reporting of data to credit reporting agencies. If consumers are able to turn on or off when the data is reported, then it,  in its essence, undermines completely the accuracy of the credit reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both those who furnish the data to the credit reporting agencies and those who use that data to offer credit to consumers rely on the accuracy of these reports so that they can appropriately and responsibly price the cost of credit to a specific consumer. If someone can decide not to submit certain data to a credit reporting agency, then the accuracy of that data will be greatly compromised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely believe that a few minor changes to the underlying legislation would indeed perfect the language in a way that would allow for new alternative data to help consumers and also to have that new data submitted in a way that does not undermine a credit reporting system that truly has become the envy of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's my hope that we can work on these concerns as this legislation moves forward, and once again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for her time and thank the Chair of the committee and subcommittee for their work on this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'm honored to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>. I commend Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this worthy legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill will increase efficiency in our section 8 housing voucher  program and expand rental assistance opportunities, authorizing 20,000 new section 8 vouchers in each of the next 5 years, with a total of 100,000 new vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 8 rental assistance is a critical and widely used program, with approximately 2 million vouchers being distributed by more than 2,500 local public housing authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to draw attention to one specific provision of this legislation which will have widespread benefits, if we did nothing else today, and I think is the most meaningful thing we're doing today, by the way, if I may express my opinion, will have widespread benefits for housing authorities throughout this Nation, including those in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, a new formula was instituted to fund public housing authorities that administer the section 8 program. The formula was based on a snapshot of PHA activity for May, June, and July of 2004. As a result, whatever a housing authority's needs were during that short period, they have been stuck with that number ever since. It is simply irrational to fund a program today based on what its needs were 3 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some housing authorities were continually overfunded, some were underfunded. This provision left some housing authorities scrambling for funds and others with extra funding they couldn't access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering today fixes this inefficient and outdated formula, requiring HUD to use data from the most recent 12 months to determine section 8 voucher funding. It's going to help a lot of people, a lot of people. Now funding will be guaranteed for all vouchers in use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even this administration has admitted that this flawed formula should be revised. I applaud the Financial Services Committee for including a fix in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to bring to the chairman's attention a situation with HUD financing that kind of makes no sense to me, and a specific situation which I'm aware of involves the Villa Nueva Apartments, which are in San Ysidro in the San Diego area of California, where the owner of this multi-family, affordable housing project wants to sell it. The buyer wants to keep it as an affordable housing project. He's committed to keep the rents unchanged, but yet since it is HUD financed, under current, I  guess, rulings or something that HUD is making, that 100 percent of the proceeds of this project would actually not be available to the seller. I don't know why someone who owns something would want to sell it if they couldn't have any of the proceeds. So, as a result, the seller may not sell this project. They may hold on to it for a couple of years, and then the restrictions will expire and then they could sell it for something else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it seems to me that HUD's procedures on this are actually standing in the way of affordable housing companies acquiring and continuing affordable housing multi-unit projects.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman from California making this very important point because it gives us a chance to highlight an important issue that this committee will be acting on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should just note that later today we will be considering an amendment on behalf of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) in similar circumstances, and we will be directing HUD to allow these to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman just learned of this, I know, and brought it to our attention, and I would begin by saying to him, if necessary, I would be supportive of doing the same in his case. I hope it won't be necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's the situation that may people may not understand. Forty years ago and more, or about 40 years ago, we began, not us, with the exception of Mr. Dingell, began a program of affordable housing where the Federal Government lent people money at either no interest or very low interest in return for it being affordable, but for some reason they put what they called an expiration date of 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we stand to lose a lot of housing that is good housing currently affordable. We are looking for ways to let that be transferred to others who would keep that it way. I think HUD is being overly technical in some of these interpretations. It would clearly be in everybody's interest, for no budgetary cost we can preserve these units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, if the units are lost, what then happens is, under certain laws, the current tenants are entitled to enhanced vouchers. So we would then be paying more in enhanced vouchers to a new landlord. That doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to make this commitment to the gentleman. I hope after today's bill, which I hope it passes and the amendments for Mr. Markey and Ms. Pryce are passed, that we can then sit with HUD on a bipartisan basis and try and find a way for them to do this administratively. If they tell us that they need a small fix, if there's some legislative problem, we could do that on suspension immediately. Even the Senate would do that one quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say this. I hope that we will, today, get HUD's attention so that we can sit with them and work this out. I would rather have it done in policy. If necessary, we'll do a little fix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would also say before the end of this year, and this is high on the agenda of the gentlewoman from California and myself, because this situation occurs all over the country in everybody's district or in most districts, if necessary, we will pass a bill that will give HUD all the authority necessary to prevent this loss of affordable housing for no good reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I admire the gentleman for bringing it to our attention. I think, frankly, if we pass this bill and pass the Markey-Pryce amendment, we'll probably get a better response out of HUD, and if necessary, we will legislate it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague for yielding. I rise also to support the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my good friend from California, Chairman MAXINE WATERS, for sponsoring this vital legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank our chair, Chairman Frank, for his leadership and guidance in this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in 2004, when the administration decided to change the funding formula for section 8 vouchers, drastic cuts were made to the number of vouchers available. These cuts hurt needy families throughout the Nation and throughout my district. We are talking about seniors, low-income families, disabled, the poor, the disadvantaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district alone, section 8 housing vouchers, public housing units, provide affordable housing for more than 32,000 people. Can you imagine, 32,000 people right now, children and others, that would not have a home, not have a place to rent, that would be homeless if it hadn't been for section 8? This bill reverses the cut and adds an additional 20,000 vouchers so that families are not forced to choose between paying for food, their medication or rent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about people that can't afford housing, even right now, with the inflation and the cost that is going on right now. We have got to make sure that they have a home, they have stability, and they have a roof over their head, especially for our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate my colleague on the other side, GARY MILLER, supporting this legislation as well. We worked on some of the amendments. I appreciate that very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also contains key provisions that strengthen section 8 programs, including protection for individuals with limited English proficiency and the expansion to Moving To Work programs. I  urge my colleagues to support this most vulnerable program that helps us, and especially as it pertains to helping the poor, the disadvantaged.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am so very, very pleased and honored to have the opportunity to work with BARNEY FRANK. Not only is he a committed public policy maker, he is smart, and he is creative. And he is helping us to understand how to use this wonderful opportunity that has been afforded to us to do good for the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so pleased about this particular bill, because I am so keenly aware of the housing crisis that we have in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we stand here this evening, there are people who are sleeping under bridges; living with them are families, children. Some of them are veterans. I come from a time and place where people did not have decent housing. I know, too, that not only has this occurred for many years in this country, where people have been living in substandard housing, even today we have people without running water. We have people without proper health facilities of any kind in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have families that are crowded into one and two rooms. We have people whose roofs were leaking this evening. But because of this government and our ability to help government understand what it can do to help the least fortunate, we are able to pass this kind of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, again, Mrs. Biggert, for the cooperation that I have enjoyed working with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again, I want to emphasize, this is a process that began when the Republicans were in power, when Mr. Ney was the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlewoman from California was the ranking minority member and has continued in her chairmanship. The gentlewoman from Illinois is the ranking member. This is an example of how you can make something better and deliver better, with one exception, there is no additional money in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that we will succeed in authorizing 20,000 new vouchers. That's an issue we will debate, although it is subject to appropriation, as to whether or not it gets done. I think our appropriator friends would like to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But most of what this does is to improve the delivery. We talk about it a lot. It isn't always done. And in that context, we often thank the staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a case where the staff of the Financial Services Committee and subcommittee on both sides, we already did a great deal of work; this is a more technical bill than many that have come forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a less than ideological breakthrough. We hope to have some of those. We have had in the past. It's more a systemic examination of a very large program with improvements of a technical and specific sort in many aspects of it. It took a good deal of hard work, and it took a good deal of mutual cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, there were some differences, and we will debate those differences, but it should be made clear that those differences come within a context of a broad agreement on making the program better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of talk about waste and fraud and abuse. Waste and fraud and abuse are more generally decried around here than diminished. This is a bill that will make it much less likely that money will be wasted, much less likely that there will be an abuse of the public purse. As I said, let me say in closing, it is to the credit of the gentlewoman from California, the gentlewoman from Illinois, and the people who have worked with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every stakeholder is a supporter of this bill, the landlords, the tenants, the advocacy groups, the housing authorities that administer it. It is rare that you get this degree of agreement. It's a process that began with civil conversation. I am pleased to see, at least on this night, it's going to end with a civil conversation, and the product will be significant improvements in one of the most important social programs in the Federal Government.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Let me thank the distinguished gentlelady from Illinois for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a historic occasion, a historic time. I want to express my appreciation to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Frank, and the chairwoman of the subcommittee, Congresswoman Waters, and the ranking members, for what I hope will ultimately be an enormous step forward for the homeless and the underserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge my colleague and friend, Congressman Al Green, who has worked so hard to ensure that cities who have the background of Houston, Texas, are also accounted for. Those are cities that have for years had thousands of individuals on the waiting list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the number 25,000 in Houston has literally become a number of the decade, because there has been a waiting list of 25,000 for as long as I can remember, having served on the Houston City Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased to acknowledge that we are going to reorder the formula so that cities can borrow against moneys that are already in their account, so that the cities that have an excessive number of individuals on the waiting list can still be able to utilize those dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to pay special attention to the resources that will be utilized for the disabled and special resources that are going to be utilized for innovative programs dealing with, for example, the housing innovation program, which has previously been Moving to Work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the issues that I hope that we will look forward to is giving incentives to cities to help them reduce the waiting list. Now, you can change the formula, and I had an amendment that would provide at least a pilot study to construct, if you will, an incentive to make sure that cities took advantage of this new structure and worked hard to reduce the waiting list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is one thing to have the laws in place. It is another thing to have housing authorities sit by and just watch, rather than working very hard to bring down their list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very grateful that we now have an understanding that there is less and less affordable housing being built in America. These individuals that use section 8 vouchers are working people, people who are paying their taxes, who cannot find housing in high-priced markets. This section 8 voucher program will allow these individuals to purchase homes. They are creative, unique and forward thinking, because they are individuals who have put their stake down in these particular areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also hoping, as I close, and I am hoping that we will continue to work on this issue, is to ensure individuals will not be put out because of combat pay for soldiers who are coming back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the "Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007." I support this bipartisan measure for three important reasons. First, <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> reforms Section 8 vouchers to make their allocation more efficient and targets them based on need. Second, the legislation also increases access for rural families, and expands the number of families receiving housing vouchers. Third, the bill permits families to use housing vouchers as a down payment on a first-time  home purchase, and includes other provisions to encourage family self-sufficiency including incentives for families to obtain employment, increase earned income, pursue higher education, and save for retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to express my special thanks to the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. FRANK, for his leadership and commitment to affordable housing for low and moderate income families. Let me also thank the gentlewoman from California, Ms. WATERS, the Chair  of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity for her yeoman work in bringing this important and much needed legislation to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, a strong America requires strong families and communities. Affordable housing is critical to maintaining strong families and communities. Section 8 housing vouchers provide vital rental assistance for low-income families, seniors, and the disabled to help them afford housing. The Section 8 housing voucher program contributes to the strengthening of our nation. Let me discuss briefly for our colleagues some of the more beneficial provisions in the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation eliminates inefficiencies that have resulted in $1.4 billion in unused funds and provides incentives for agencies to use funds to assist more families. Thus, the voucher Funding Formula is made more efficient and will lead to an increase in the number of families receiving vouchers. And that is good because the number of housing vouchers issued has declined more than 150,000 since 2004. The bill authorizes 20,000 incremental vouchers in each of the next five years, for a total  of 100,000 new vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I also support this legislation because it protects tenant rights, promotes home ownership, and encourages economic self-sufficiency for low income voucher and public housing families. The legislation also protects housing agencies adversely affected by formula changes, by allowing them to use voucher reserves in the transition to maintain the number of families being assisted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homeownership is promoted because, for the first time, families will be permitted to use housing vouchers as a down-payment on a first-time home purchase, and to use vouchers for purchase of a manufactured home on leased land. Economic self-sufficiency for low income voucher and public housing families is encouraged because <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> includes several incentives for families to obtain employment, increase earned income, pursue higher education, and save for retirement. The bill also increases  voucher opportunities for lower-income working families in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill contains several tenant protections, including provisions to preserve voucher families' ability to move to other areas, to address excessive voucher rent burdens, to provide for more accurate fair market rent calculations, and to protect voucher holders in units that are in need of repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for millions of our fellow citizens, finding safe and affordable housing is still a constant and often futile struggle. Today, about 1.4 million households nationwide participate in the voucher program; but not all qualified applicants are guaranteed housing. The demand for housing assistance consistently exceeds the limited resources available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and local government agencies. Long waiting lists have, unfortunately, become very  common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my hometown of Houston, the largest city in Texas, and the fourth largest in the United States, there is a multi-year backlog of applications for individuals seeking government assistance. It is not unusual for individuals and families to be placed on the waiting list for more than three years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it imperative that something be done to reduce this backlog. That is why I offered an amendment to the bill that would establish a pilot program to aid in the reduction of Section 8 waiting list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I also offered an amendment providing that funds received by a section 8 family from a family member serving in the Armed Forces in a hostile combat theater be excluded from the computation of income for eligibility purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The military is one of Americans most precious resources and one whose efforts ought to never be taken for granted. Daily, these men and women in uniform risk their lives to ensure the national security and safety of our country. One way to express our gratitude to them is to offer relief to their family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eligibility for housing vouchers is typically based on the family size and the total annual gross income, which ought to not exceed 50 percent of the median income for the area in which they choose to live. HUD's Housing Voucher (HCV) handbook lists both special pay (except pay received by a service member who is exposed to hostile fire) and the Base Housing Allowance (BAH) as income for purposes of determining a family's income eligibility. Excluding monies received by section 8 tenants from  family members serving in combat zones when evaluating income eligibility for Section 8 housing would provide a little piece of mind to the families of these soldiers serving overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final amendment I offered sought to provide economic opportunities to Section 8 tenants by requiring the Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development carry out programs whereby public housing agencies develop curriculums and policies designed to increase employment and contracting opportunities for recipients of tenant-based rental assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937. These economic opportunities can be in the form of maintenance, inspection, and management of rental  properties for which rental assistance is provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families living with Section 8 vouchers can achieve self-sufficiency through active participation in education and employment. Self-sufficiency eliminates the need to be dependent on public assistance and increase one's self esteem and sense of accomplishment. My amendment was intended to help section 8 become more economically independent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But taken as a whole, Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> is a very good bill and represents a significant step forward in the direction of an enlightened policy of affordable housing. Accordingly, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the "Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007." I urge my colleagues to join in voting for this much need legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we have been working on housing issues for several years. I think we do have a very good job in this House coming to an agreement. Moving to the Senate, for some reason, things just don't happen as they should on that side of the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have got tremendous housing shortages in this country that we have to deal with. We have to work on HOPE VI program to be more innovative to allow the private sector to get involved. We need to be able to take and move people through the system for public housing section 8 vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the area we are really hurting in in this country is the move-up marketplace for people coming out of section 8, coming out of public housing and to be able to move into a house that's affordable. We all have problems in many of our districts where our children go away to college; we know people who, when their kids come back, they can't afford to live in the communities in which they were raised. We know many people who may be a school teacher, a police officer, a fireman, who drive 2 hours  back and forth to work because they can't afford to live within the community in which they work. That should be a focus of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We not only have to deal with the HOPE VI program, we have to deal with the public housing program, the section 8. We have to look at streamlining the system where builders and developers in this country can bring affordable housing on line and make it available for people who are moving out of government assistance into homes of their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Moving To Work program, I think, is going to work very well. It allows people to retain some earnings, to build up the savings to be able to afford to move into a home for the first time. We have a lot of nonprofits in this country that provide down-payment assistance, programs who help people that can afford a payment but don't have the cash on hand within which to be able to put down and pay the closing costs to move into a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have got to look at the overall industry and say, how can we be innovative? How can we be creative? And how can we help people to help themselves? Now, I am a conservative. I don't believe in government programs going on forever. But I think people come to a point in their life where they need a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to look at ways to help them go on their open to become self-sufficient. That's what I hope we do in Congress, not only look at reforming the government programs we have here today to make them more innovative, make them work for people. In L.A. County, there is a 10-year wait for people to go on vouchers or public housing. That has to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People wait for 10 years who are just as needy or more needy sometimes than people who are receiving assistance. But we have no way of moving those people out of government programs into their own homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's what we need to look at, streamlining, removing the red tape, fast tracking, have some nexus between the cost that's assessed against the project and the actual cost of that project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend BARNEY FRANK. Over the years, he and I have worked on more legislation on housing I think than any two Members from the Republican and Democrat side together that try to create programs that work for people. Tonight's bill might not be everything they want. I know it's not  everything that MAXINE WATERS and BARNEY FRANK wants, but it was an agreement between the two of us in a bipartisan fashion, Republicans and  Democrats, to come and fashion a bill that would work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this bill has some innovation. It makes some changes, and I think it moves us in a better direction. Are we where we should be completely? No, but we are moving in a good direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to cooperation from both sides.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this moment to thank someone who is not here in the Congress with us at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we first started this legislation in the previous Congress, it was with Mr. Bob Ney who served as chair of the subcommittee; I was the ranking member; and we put this bill out on the floor where it passed this House, and he deserves credit for all the work that was done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank some of the other members who we have not heard from this evening in general debate and hopefully we will hear from a little later on. Mr. Green from Texas who insisted that we expand the vouchers to make them available to the needy families who certainly have been standing in line waiting on section 8 vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Mr. DAVID SCOTT for being one of the most adamant and fierce defenders of the work that we have done and who has taken on the work of trying to educate some of our Members from the other side of the aisle, not only about the need, but how not to penalize the victims and people who are looking for housing opportunities who would not be able to get them but for section 8 and the work that we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to close by thanking the chairman who is so committed to helping those who need us most. He is certainly the kind of leader that we can depend on to make sure that everything possible is done, to utilize the time that we have been given in this committee to work for people who oftentimes have been dropped off of America's agenda. Again, he provides strong leadership. He is generous with sharing opportunities with everybody that serves on that committee. And it is because  of that kind of leadership and, again, the cooperation from my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, Mrs. Biggert, Mr. Miller, Mr. Shays, and others that we come to this floor tonight with a good strong bill that is going to help so very many people in this country, and it is the kind of public policy that makes us all feel very good about being elected officials.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, to reform the housing choice voucher program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. I commend the Honorable MAXINE WATERS for her leadership on this issue of pressing socioeconomic concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1937, we had a Nation still suffering from the Great Depression. In fact, in 1937, the economy fell into a recession which caused high unemployment and left many wondering how they would put a roof over their family's heads at night. In response to this problem, the United States Housing Act was enacted, which helped hard-working American families to stay off of the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also helped to push the United States policy of spending on infrastructure to help the economy, as promoted by the principles of Keynesian economics. In today's economy we are seeing a new problem emerge--the growing income gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a January 27, 2007, CNN report entitled, "Mind the gap: Income Inequality, State by State," Americans whose annual income places them in the top 5 percent of the income bracket "saw their incomes rise as much as 132 percent between 1980 and 2003. The bottom 20 percent of families, meanwhile, saw their incomes rise by no more than 24 percent." With such inequality today's housing crisis becomes obvious--the "haves" are purchasing more real-estate and thus driving housing costs  to levels far above the budget of "have-nots."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as the Federal Government took the lead and helped struggling American families in 1937, we must step in and make sure their efforts are applicable to today's specific housing crisis by amending Section 8 of the United States Housing Act 1937 to address the problems of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district of the Virgin Islands I see multimillion dollar estates constructed in areas of previously low to moderate income. Often times this works to drive up property values and drive out those who can no longer afford to live in the area. It has driven up housing costs and even rental prices. This bill will help address this issue by adding 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers, and by expanding their use for home purchase as well as rent. It will allow a public housing agency to authorize a  family in crisis to occupy housing immediately so they are not left on the streets while a slow moving bureaucratic agency "evaluates" them. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> also includes provisions to address existing inadequacies in the programs that have created long waiting lists and a program that has more applicants than available housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, Congress will take a much needed step towards improving a much needed program. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and help make a good program stronger and better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007. This bill will expand Section 8 Vouchers to improve system efficiency, encourage self-sufficiency, and increase the number of families who can participate. There are currently 20,370 vouchers in use in New York's 17th district which I proudly represent, and 2 million families using vouchers nationwide. These Section 8 Vouchers allow low-income families to choose the housing option that best  fits their needs, and encourages permanent economic stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, there is funding for 150,000 vouchers that are not in use under the current Section 8 Voucher formula. By reforming Section 8 Vouchers, we put funding and vouchers in the hands of people who need them the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in New York we highly value Section 8 Vouchers housing. The vouchers provide much-needed assistance to families and individuals wishing to become more economically self-sufficient, but who lack the means to do so on their own. Simplifying and expanding Section 8 Vouchers will help alleviate a monumental housing crisis in the state of New York and throughout the country. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> relieves pressure on struggling communities and families and will bring economic security and self-sufficiency  within their reach. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> reforms Section 8 Vouchers in a comprehensive and logical way, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today's passage of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the Section 8 Voucher Act (SERVA) will improve greatly the housing voucher system--which is already successful and has been described by the Administration as one of the federal government's most effective programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Safe and affordable housing is one of my priorities and should be a national priority. Section 8 vouchers are a great tool for getting families into decent homes. Studies have shown that Section 8 vouchers reduce homelessness, overcrowding, and frequent moves from apartment to apartment. Affordable housing is critical to strong families and communities, and vouchers have allowed families to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods with better schools and less exposure to crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> will only increase the success of Section 8 vouchers, which currently provides housing assistance to more than 2 million families, by making the program more efficient and more effective. From 2004 to 2006, voucher funds were allocated using a series of  ineffectual formulas that gave some agencies less funding than they needed to cover the costs of their vouchers--forcing them to cut back for needy families--while other agencies were given  more funds than they could use. This resulted in $1.4 billion of unused funds and, more importantly, 150,000 more low-income families without vouchers. SERVA would base funding on the actual cost of each agency's vouchers in the previous year. This will allow housing agencies, apartment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to establishing such a stable, efficient and equitable voucher funding policy, SERVA will additionally remove barriers to voucher "portability", as well as streamline the rules for determining tenants' rent payment. It will authorize 100,000 new vouchers over five years' time, and include provisions to encourage economic self-sufficiency. It will also allow families to use housing vouchers as a down payment on a first-time home purchase, gives a limited number of Public Housing  Agencies some flexibility to experiment with development and rent policies, and makes it easier for housing agencies to attach vouchers to housing units. These reforms will provide vital rental assistance for seniors and the disabled as well as low-income families, as well as provide a welcome opportunity for low-income families to achieve the American Dream of home ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By reforming an already highly successful program, we can improve the quality of life for many American families, elderly, and disabled citizen all over the country by offering them more and better choices of communities to live in.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to commend my good friend Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS, chairwoman of the Housing Subcommittee, for introducing this bill, navigating it through the House Committee on Financial Services and bringing this important and necessary piece of legislation to the floor today for consideration by the full House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the utmost respect for Chairwoman WATERS--for all that she has done and is doing to improve the housing conditions for Americans, especially the moderate- to low-income, minorities, the disabled and the elderly. She has helped me considerably in my efforts to improve housing conditions in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while some form of Section 8 rental assistance has been in place since the mid-1970s, the modern program was shaped largely by the 1998 public housing reform act. Nearly 10 years later, the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program came under new scrutiny, with Public Housing Authority industry leaders, low-income housing advocates, and some Members of Congress calling for reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairwoman WATERS heeded that call and has brought to the floor today a bill that will help not only the poorest of the poor with housing vouchers but also provide the public housing authorities in my district and across the nation with the tools they need to better serve our constituents. The bill includes significant improvements to the voucher program, which provides rental assistance to about 1.8 million families, the majority of whom are extremely poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Applaud the provision in the bill that permits public housing authorities to let families use housing vouchers as a down payment on a first-time home purchase, and the section authorizing 20,000 sorely needed incremental vouchers in each of the next 5 years, for a total of 100,000 new vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons and more, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the "Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I regret that I will be unable to vote "yes" tonight for passage of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>. I was scheduled to be in Detroit in order to receive the NAACP's most prestigious award, the "Spingarn award." I applaud the vision, courage and compassion of Representative MAXINE WATERS for introducing the "Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>." I strongly support the legislation, because it expands Section 8 vouchers for working families in America who are in  desperate need of affordable housing by creating 20,000 incremental Section 8 vouchers in each of the next 5 years for a total of 100,000 new vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a nation where affordable housing is scarce, and family homeless shelters continue to be built across the nation, passage of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> is a vitally important step in having the Federal Government take the lead in expanding affordable housing for deserving families and children in America. There are approximately 16,000 individuals and families who are currently on the Detroit Public Housing Waiting List. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> will help reduce the affordable housing crisis in Detroit, by increasing the  availability of housing units through the expansion of Section 8 housing. It clearly does not make sense, nor is it fair, to have apartments available for rent in Detroit, but not enough citizens to move into them, only because there have not been a sufficient supply of Section 8 vouchers in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> also changes rent calculation, recertification, and inspection rules for the voucher, public housing, and project based Section 8 programs, to reduce costs and compliance burdens for public housing agencies, landlords, and families. These changes are made while maintaining rules that target scarce resources to those families most in need and while maintaining rent calculation rules that ensure rents are affordable. This will mean that Section 8 apartments will now become more affordable  due to changes in rent calculation formulas mandated in <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> also permits public housing agencies across this country to allow families in need of affordable housing to use a Section 8 housing voucher as a down payment on a first time home purchase. Passage of this legislation means scores of working families in Detroit, many who have saved and sacrificed the entire lives to buy a home, will be now able to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>." Is a critically important piece of legislation because it reforms HUD Section 8 guidelines to ensure that the approximately $1.4 billion in unused Section 8 funds will now be spent. This legislation mandates reforms in the Section 8 program that will eliminate inefficiencies, streamline paper work, and provide more incentives for public housing agencies to assist more families who qualify for Section 8 housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having an additional $1.4 billion dollars to be used for Section 8 housing vouchers means that there will be a substantial increase in families in Detroit who will live in safe and decent affordable housing. There are too many working families in Detroit, and across this nation, who are living in homeless shelters, expensive inner city hotels, and staying with friends and relatives until they can locate housing. This is a moral outrage. All Americans deserve safe, decent, and affordable permanent  housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Representative MAXINE WATERS, passage of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> shows how we as Democrats have always had a historical commitment to expanding affordable housing to working families, and will continue to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are to be a truly compassionate and moral nation, all individuals and families, regardless of income, race, or employment status must have as a fundamental human and civil right safe, decent, and affordable housing. Passage of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> is a critically important piece of legislation that will move America closer to this goal. Now, 100,000 additional Americans will have the opportunity to either become home owners, or move into an apartment, something that we can all agree on should be one  of the highest priorities of this Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS.">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. BARNEY FRANK, and Ranking Member JUDY BIGGERT for their strong support of the manager's amendment to <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the amendment is to reform and improve the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, regarding inspections, flexibility in rent-setting, transitional funding for the Nation's Public Housing Agencies, administrative fee calculations, limited English proficiency requirements, and the Housing Innovation Program. It also makes technical corrections to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment provides more flexibility to make inspections by requiring them less frequently than every 2 years. This change will allow PHAs in areas with a deteriorating housing stock to conduct additional inspections in order to make sure families are housed in safe and decent units. In addition, the amendment fills the need for inspections that can be conducted at the request of the tenant within a specific amount of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment solves a real catch-22 that often arises in the section 8 program. Many section 8 landlords are not large real estate concerns, but mom-and-pop operations that are not getting rich. Where units operated by a landlord fail inspection, right now there is a real danger that the landlord will choose to leave the program rather than make the repairs. This benefits nobody. And there is the catch-22. The landlord wants to stay in the program; the tenant certainly wants to stay in the unit  if it can be repaired; but current law makes this positive resolution difficult to achieve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PHAs will have the option to make repairs on the landlord's behalf. If the PHA or the landlord choose not to make the repair, the amendment protects tenants who will have to move to a new unit through no fault of their own. In the event a PHA chooses not to make a repair and the landlord still declines to repair the unit, the amendment provides important tenant protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is rent flexibility. Sometimes the rigid section 8 rent structure just  doesn't work. In order to find a rent mechanism that works, the amendment gives PHAs flexibility in setting rents. While the calculations may be different, the amendment preserves affordability standards that limit the amount of rent a tenant pays to 30 percent of his or her income. The 30 percent threshold is sacred, because we all know that if the rent exceeds this amount,  tenants lose the ability to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we move to a new funding formula, PHAs will need sufficient reserves to allow them to make the change smoothly and with little disruption for tenants. <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> provides a 1-month reserve for the first year of the formula. But to ensure that PHAs are able to serve additional families in the formula's first year, the amendment moderately increases this reserve from the 1-month level to the 1 1/2 -month level. This ensures PHAs will have adequate funds to transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment corrects the disparity between the calculation of the administrative fees for project-based units owned by PHAs and other units in the PHA's inventory. Units owned by PHAs would receive the same fee as other units receiving project-based assistance in the PHA's inventory, providing an incentive for PHAs to create housing opportunities by project-basing its own units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also addresses HUD's problematic implementation of Limitation of English Proficiency requirements. The manager's amendment seeks to remedy this problem. The amendment calls for HUD to convene a task force of interested parties and stakeholders who will determine the documents that need to be translated, and to make these translations available in various languages within 6 months. HUD is also required to maintain a housing information resource center, including a 24-hour toll-free  number and a document clearinghouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also include Housing Innovation Program, that is HIP program, formerly known as Moving to Work, and this amendment makes several corrections to the Housing Innovation Program formerly called Moving to Work. These changes clarify that troubled agencies are not eligible to participate in the program, clarifies resident participation requirements, specifies job opportunities to be made for residents, and ensures that following demolition or replacement of public housing units, that families cannot  be screened out of public housing unless they are otherwise ineligible under Federal law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask support for the manager's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS.">
    <paragraph>I want to thank you for including my language on reform in the manager's amendment. This I believe goes a long way to create innovation in helping people gain self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main reason I want to speak today is because many on my side have a real problem with the requirement that language be translated into a language that anybody who might come to a HUD assistance program might require to speak, and your bill goes a long way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have consistently supported every effort to repeal President Clinton's executive order which requires any recipient of Federal funds to provide translations into any language an individual requesting service may speak; but recently, HUD has issued a requirement that says that any housing authority or PHA must provide this translation to individuals who come before them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the Federal Government creating a mandate and requiring the private sector to pay the bill. And what you are doing I wholeheartedly support. You are saying that if the Federal Government wants to require a mandate, then they should pay the bill. It has been estimated that one of these translations can cost a section 8 individual or group or housing authority up to $10,000 for each language they want to translate the documents into, and what you are doing is absolutely correct. If we are  not going to change the law, then let's not have an unfunded mandate placed on the private sector that the private sector has to pay for when HUD and the Federal Government wants to mandate it. And what you are saying is: HUD, if you want to mandate it, you pick up the bill. And I think that is very important that we do this, and I want to stand up saying I wholeheartedly support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not support the mandate, period, that Clinton imposed, but we are stuck with it. It is an executive order. And what you are saying is the private sector should not be suffering the burden of an unfunded mandate if the Federal Government wants to mandate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to clarify for my side that what we are doing here is saying we are relieving an unfunded mandate on the private sector and placing the burden on the Federal Government, who should be responsible. And if we want to change the law, let's change the law. But until we change the law, the private sector should not suffer the burden of financing something the Federal Government is imposing on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wholeheartedly support the manager's amendment, and I thank you for working with me on rent reform and other things.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS.">
    <paragraph>The gentleman has given a very clear statement of what is in here. This bill does not create the bilingual mandate; it puts it where it should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing I would say is this, and I understand there are some who oppose it on principle. But from the court's standpoint, having HUD do the translation of all these documents means that they don't have to be done individually. So it also is cheaper for HUD to do. It is not just that it is more appropriate for the Federal Government to do it, but it is cheaper, because there will be some basic HUD documents so this will avoid the unnecessary duplication of translations. And I thank the  gentleman for that very clear way he stated it.</paragraph>

  <chair>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</chair>
  <chair>Madam Chairman, let me first commend Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for their leadership in moving this necessary reform forward. They led the Financial Services Committee through a healthy but complicated series of issues and produced a bill that truly improves the section 8 program.</chair>
  <chair>Section 8 is the Nation's largest low-income housing program. It currently enables more than 2 million low-income families to fulfill the basic needs of shelter. We should strive to help more people find safe and decent housing. That is why this bill includes 100,000 new vouchers over the next 5 years. It is critical that we support this bipartisan work that transitions people out of poverty.</chair>
  <chair>Keeping people safe is at the heart of my amendment, which may seem minor, but provides important eviction and privacy protection for victims of domestic violence who live in section 8 housing. Let us not allow domestic violence victims to fall through the cracks.</chair>
  <chair>It does this by ensuring that residents are not evicted simply because they are victims of domestic violence. While it is hard to believe, under current law, if a resident is visited by a former spouse, a stalker or domestic abuser, and he breaks down the door, the very noise and property damage caused by the dispute could be grounds for her to be evicted. Being abused should not be cause for terminating a lease. My amendment changes that by protecting section 8 tenants from wrongful eviction.</chair>
  <chair>It is fundamentally wrong to evict a resident because they have been victimized. The individuals and their families deserve our respect and understanding. This provision ensures that domestic violence victims have a safe home for them and their families.</chair>
  <chair>Second, my amendment protects the record of domestic violence victims. If certain identifying characteristics are made public, even to a prospective landlord, abusers could use the information to locate their victims. This goes beyond just name and Social Security number. The key is making sure that their information is protected so that victims move forward without the fear of being found. Their safety must be first and foremost. Let's give section 8 tenants basic protections to ensure they  can find and keep a safe home away from violence.</chair>
  <chair>Madam Chairwoman, I support the improvements to the section 8 program that <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> makes and want to thank Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters again for their diligence on this bill. I think it is important that we remember that finding a home entails feeling safe, not just securing shelter.</chair>
  <chair>In 2005, we fought in unison to protect domestic violence victims through VAWA; 415 Members of the 109th Congress supported these provisions back then. Today I am asking you to close a potential loophole for section 8 housing residents who are victims of domestic violence. I urge a "yes" vote on my amendment and the underlying bill.</chair>
  <chair>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Violence Against Women Act reauthorized and signed into law by President Bush in 2005 ensured that victims of domestic violence would not be evicted from public or section 8 housing for screaming for help, for calling the police or simply for being the victim of a crime. However, one provision of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> inadvertently removes these protections from certain public housing authorities, leaving victims in these housing authorities with inconsistent or no protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that the Housing Innovation Program provisions in SEVRA exempt high-performing public housing authorities from certain Federal regulations, giving them a measure of regulatory reform. Unfortunately, some of the VAWA protections were among those that would no longer apply to these high-performing housing authorities. This would create confusion for public housing authorities and leave victims vulnerable to eviction after an assault.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment with my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) to limit the amount of time a section 8 recipient may receive housing assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this amendment offers a reasonable approach to a very difficult issue. The intent of this amendment is not to be harsh or uncaring. If you read the amendment, you will see that we provide exemptions for the elderly, for the disabled and for hardship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is an attempt to inject fairness into this program, where we are faced with the fiscal reality that we do not have the resources to provide unlimited housing assistance to all those who want to participate in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will help those who have been waiting a long time for their turn for the helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we started working on section 8 reform legislation a couple of years ago, I asked my staff to review all the casework inquiries we had received from constituents about the section 8 program. This review revealed that section 8 recipients weren't contacting me to help them with problems with their housing or HUD regulations; the constituents who had contacted my office were complaining about the fact that they had been on the section 8 waiting list for years and were just as in need as those  who are receiving assistance currently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to HUD, the average length of time families spend on the waiting list for subsidized housing in the United States is more than 2 years. In cities like Los Angeles, the waiting list is approaching 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we justify a situation where one person is given unlimited Federal housing assistance, while another who might have greater need is on the waiting list and unable to participate in the program for almost 10 years?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer is not to allow this program to continue to grow out of control by providing more vouchers. Rather, we must reform the program so that participants can transition into self-sufficiency within a reasonable period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer is to institute a reasonable time limit for assistance, which would give more families the ability to benefit from our Nation's temporary helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I offer today is based on the successful reform we made to the welfare program in 1996. Under the amendment, the maximum amount of time during which a family may receive section 8 assistance is 7 years. Time limits would not apply to elderly or disabled families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there is a hardship exemption for families who need extra time due to circumstances beyond their control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some might argue that we should increase the number of section 8 vouchers that are available so we can serve all those who are on the waiting list, the practical reality is that we cannot already sustain the growth in the current section 8 program. Our aim should be not to expand the program more but instead reform it to allow it to provide assistance to more people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with the section 8 program growing out of control, it is not helping all the people that it could. This amendment is one way to ensure that our Federal limited resources may be used to help all those who need help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, Madam Chair, in the interest of conciliation that has marked this debate, I would say to my friend from California, I would be willing to accept this amendment that puts a time limit on people being able to stay in section 8 if we could work out a time limit on their being poor. I think it is entirely accurate that when you're no longer poor, you should no longer be able to live in section 8. But what if we can't?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can understand people who think that there are adults who have not been very responsible in their life choices, but some of the adults come with children. The gentleman exempts the disabled and the elderly, but his amendment does not exempt families with small children. So you have a parent with children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="">
    <paragraph>The intent of this amendment is to allow for hardship cases like that. A single mother who has young children would be a hardship.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman point that out to me in the amendment?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We tried to allow the Housing Authority----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>No. They have a certain number. They can make certain exemptions up to 20 percent.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="">
    <paragraph>On page 2, hardship exemption, number 3. It allows the housing authority to create exemptions for families in a hardship. And that would be one of the exemptions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, not exceeding more than 20 percent of the families. It doesn't single out children. Well, maybe there will be 30 or 40 percent, because in my experience, it may differ, you say make an exception for a hardship. That's not the exception for people in section 8; it's the rule. There aren't a lot of rich people living in section 8 or middle income people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that under the gentleman's amendment, if adopted, there will be single parents with children of 7 or 8 or 10 years old, several of them, and at the end of 5 years, they'll have to move. Those kids didn't do anything to anybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you know what we've learned from education and from homelessness, 7 years, the gentleman tells me. He does give them 7 years. It's very biblical. But they'll still have to move after 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Churning poor people isn't useful. Making people move isn't useful. We've adopted some rules here. The gentleman knows we agreed with him that we should not charge them for more rent if they're making more money. We don't want to have a disincentive. We've done other things to improve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here's a fundamental point. People in section 8 housing are there because they meet strict income criteria. Under the gentleman's amendment, someone who continues to be poor, who continues to meet the income criteria, who has lived up to every rule, who has small children, who has tried diligently to get a better job, but in many parts of this country, by the way, we're talking about working people. There are many people who can work full-time at twice the minimum wage and not be able to  afford rental housing in his district or in parts of my district or in other districts, the gentlewoman from California's district. And they'd be evicted. They'd be evicted from housing that they were eligible for, for no reason other than the clock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just note that I don't think we are doing those kids living in section 8 housing any favors by encouraging a life or a lifestyle of living in section 8 housing. I think we're doing them a great disservice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank the gentleman from California for his efforts to bring more accountability and responsibility to the section 8 program, a program that, let's face it, is in need of fundamental reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, this is a very straightforward and commonsense amendment, and again, I want to commend the gentleman for offering it. It would simply place a time limit, one that I believe is generous, on able-bodied individuals currently receiving housing assistance through the section 8 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, there are no time limits. Those on section 8 can remain on section 8 for as long as they qualify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that fair to the taxpayers? No. Is it fair to the section 8 recipients who become trapped in a life of dependency or to their children? I don't think so. Is it fair that the current lack of time limits prevent those on the waiting list, who may have fallen on hard times and are genuinely looking for a temporary helping hand, from receiving help? I don't think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I would submit that the current lack of time limits isn't fair to anyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've seen the positive effects that time limits and work requirements can have on social programs. We need look no further back in history than the 1996 Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, or the welfare reform law, that reformed the old welfare system, a system that had trapped so many into a life of dependency and poverty. And the old welfare system bears a remarkable resemblance to the section 8 program. And I think that's just unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do better in this country than section 8 housing and condemning both adults and children to the conditions that they have to live in, in my community in Cincinnati or communities all over the country. Section 8 housing is not the type of lifestyle that I think we want to condemn those people living in them or their children to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And I don't think the taxpayers ought to be required to pay for this subsidized housing forever in some cases.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think, Mr. Frank, you know my heart, and you and I have worked on a lot of stuff. I think Mr. Chabot and I would be willing to accept a 50-percent exemption for single mothers with multiple children who have a hardship, who are unable to move in the sector. So we are willing to cooperate. We are not trying to throw mothers with children out of the home.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would say to my friend from California, work on that in a future amendment and we will look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to address the gentleman from Ohio. He says he wants to help these people and save them. Boy, would they be in trouble if somebody came to hurt them. He is going to help them by evicting them when they remain economically eligible. And he says it is encouraging dependence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in many parts of this country, you can be making two and three times the minimum wage and not be able to afford decent rental housing, and that is who gets the section 8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then he says that section 8 housing is so terrible that we have to keep people from having to live there. But does the gentleman think that there are people who say, "You know what? I can live in a nice place or I can live in a lousy place. I think I'll choose a lousy place until the gentleman from Ohio comes along and rescues me from it"?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People live in the best place available to them, and throwing them out of the place they now live in when they have done nothing wrong because you don't think it is good enough for them when there is no alternative that is as good is hardly helping them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The section 8 program is one that serves many people who work. It is a sliding scale of subsidy, and to say that it encourages dependency totally misunderstands the program. Many of these people are people who are working and they work at low-wage jobs in areas with high rent. How are you encouraging dependency by telling them and their children that after 7 years they go out? What kind of an incentive is that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, this amendment takes people who have already been in some economic difficulty and makes their lives harder. I hope that it is rejected.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise with an amendment that I am making in conjunction with the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce). Our  language seeks to make some technical corrections to ensure that affordable housing is preserved in three housing developments, two located in Ohio and one in Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The low-income tenants of the Heritage Apartments in Malden, Massachusetts, are facing possible displacement once an outstanding HUD mortgage is fully paid in a few years. The development is also in need of major renovations and upgrades that simply cannot be delayed. Unfortunately, HUD is failing to ensure that the development remains affordable and livable by placing burdensome regulations and restrictions on prepayment of the outstanding mortgage and subsequent transfer to a new owner who  is willing to finance the renovations. My amendment would allow income-eligible residents to qualify for enhanced housing vouchers following the prepayment of the HUD mortgage and the property transfer and directs HUD to approve such actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will defer to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) to explain the portion of our amendment which deals with maintaining affordability in housing developments located in her congressional district in Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office has determined that adoption of this language would result in $1 million in net savings to current mandatory spending over the next 5 years because HUD is currently paying mortgage interest reduction payments for the development which would be nullified upon adoption of the Markey-Pryce amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment is supported by the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. It is also supported by the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, and the National Association of Home Builders. And I urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Markey/Pryce amendment to <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment includes important language, which I authored, to permit the transfer of project-based Section 8 rent assistance from concentrated, blight-ridden areas in Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio to less precarious, rehabilitated living conditions. The affected neighborhoods all have high poverty rates, a high number of assisted housing units, high crime rates, and dilapidated buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This transfer would have no additional cost to the Federal Government. The language preserves the exact same number of assisted units and the same dollar amount of Federal assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits to the community and to the tenants are immeasurable. Though struggling, each of these neighborhoods has seen an increasing amount of public and private scrutiny and investment. Low income and other residents alike would share in the benefits of a safer, more stable, and more thriving neighborhood. This proposal would allow the community to find more productive and beneficial uses for the properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal has widespread support from both communities. Tenants, community advocates, government officials, and private developers alike--all support the neighborhoods' improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would not be here today if for the past 6 years in Columbus the community had not explored other possible solutions with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, tenants, advocates, the City of Columbus, the Ohio State University officials, contractors, and other key stakeholders, but statutory restrictions constantly impeded progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We find ourselves here, not as a first resort, but as a last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman FRANK and Ranking Member BACHUS for their support, and my colleague from Massachusetts for working with me to enact this important fix into law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one of three amendments that I am offering this evening, two of the three with a couple of my colleagues, one Mr. Miller from California and Mr. Hensarling from Texas, that would encourage fundamental reforms in the section 8 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we committed ourselves to welfare reform, it was the understanding that the program should no longer be a taxpayer-funded handout but should instead offer people a way out of poverty, helping them obtain job and education skills that are needed to become ultimately self-sufficient. Ending welfare's cycle of dependency has cut the welfare rolls in half, promoted individual responsibility, and saved billions of tax dollars in the process. Sadly, current housing programs closely resemble the  failed welfare policies of the past. Like the old welfare programs, the section 8 housing program, unfortunately, discourages work and allows people to stay, in fact, encourages them to stay on the program, oftentimes indefinitely. It is also too often mismanaged by local governments or local housing authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this bill does not address those issues but instead expands the program to 100,000 new section 8 vouchers at the cost of approximately 2.4 billion taxpayer dollars over the next 5 years. That is 100,000, approximately, more recipients that get a chunk of the rent that is ultimately going to be picked up by their fellow taxpayers and ultimately, in my view, doesn't do the people that become dependent upon this good in the long term. That is 100,000 more recipients who don't have  to work to stay in the program, and that is 100,000 recipients that are being supported by the American taxpayers for as long as they like since section 8 now imposes no time limits on the beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent most of the city of Cincinnati and its western suburbs and a few townships in Butler County, Ohio. Too many neighborhoods in my district have had to witness crime, despair, and hopelessness that are inherent in a government program that asks virtually nothing of its recipients, that encourages dependency rather than responsibility and waste, unfortunately, rather than work. Whether it is the  funding provided by the Federal Government or mismanagement  of the program by local governments and agencies, section 8 has failed those who use it and those who pay for it: the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is straightforward. It would simply stop throwing good money after bad and seeks to prevent more Americans from falling victim to a life of dependency on the government. My amendment would simply prohibit the dollars this bill authorizes from being spent on the 100,000 new vouchers that this legislation would create.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to point out that the dependency that section 8 has created is so great that there are long waiting lists to get vouchers. Why? Because many of those who gain access to the program ultimately don't leave. They don't really have an incentive to. The average stay is about 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, if we simply put time limits and meaningful work requirements in the program, as the amendments that I have offered with Mr. Miller and Mr. Hensarling would do, there wouldn't be a need to create more vouchers because people would be moving through the system, moving toward independence and a better life, and that nondependence on the government is what every American should want.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400653" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, allow me to first thank the chairperson of the Financial Services Committee, Chairperson Frank. He has done an outstanding job with his leadership. I also thank the Honorable MAXINE WATERS, the subcommittee chairperson, for her sound stewardship; and, of course, Ranking Member Bachus for his bipartisanship because it helped to synthesize this piece of legislation. And I also thank the cosponsorship of Congresswoman Biggert. She has  been cogent with her cosponsorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me simply say that this is bipartisan legislation that we are talking about and the striking of the 100,000 vouchers over 5 years will put an end to what started as bipartisan legislation in the committee. This was passed overwhelmingly in the committee, and it was supported by the ranking member of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not, as was indicated, a handout. It is really a hand up for the disabled. It is a hand up for the elderly. And it also benefits low-income to extremely low-income persons, many of whom are working and still not in a position to afford affordable housing. Many of them need the kind of help that this bill is providing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, and you shall know the truth, and it will set you free. So at this moment, I am going to take the ax of truth, slam it into the tree of circumstance, and let the chips fall wherever they may. The truth is one in seven households in this country spends more than 50 percent of their income on housing. Three-quarters of a million people are homeless on any given night in this country. Congress has not provided new section 8 vouchers since 2002. The truth is we can pay for one of these  vouchers with 2 seconds of what we spend on the war in Iraq. We can pay for all of these vouchers with what we spend on 2 1/2  days in Iraq. The truth is the need exists for these vouchers. The truth is it is time for Congress to act and to authorize these new section 8 vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at this time I would like to yield 1 minute to my outstanding colleague Congressman CHRIS MURPHY.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank my friend for his great work on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important to address the concept presented by our friends on the other side of the aisle that the folks who are the recipients of these vouchers are victims. Well, they might be victims, but they are victims of an economy which says to far too many people out in this world that if you play by the rules, if you do everything we ask of you, if you go out and get a job, a full-time regular job, that you are still going to be living in poverty, that you are still going to need a little  help to be able to survive in this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In a high-cost-of-living State and a high-cost-of-housing State like Connecticut, 5,000 vouchers does not do it for the working poor there. We have people in our neck of the woods that are paying 60, 70, 80 percent of their income, hard-earned income on rent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are a part of the world that desperately needs more section 8 housing vouchers to help the working poor, the people who are doing everything this society asks them to do. But because we live in an economy where wages are stagnant and the cost of living continues to rise, a program like this is a very valuable and needed helping hand.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I would just like to reiterate the fact that I don't think we're doing either the children or the people that have become dependent on section 8 housing any favors by allowing, number one, the area that we covered in the last amendment, people to remain on section 8 housing indefinitely. I think that the time limit that's been proposed in the previous amendment is certainly a step in the right direction. The amendment that we have following this goes to a work requirement,  which I think is also very reasonable in a program such as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think encouraging people to remain dependent upon the government in the conditions that oftentimes we see in section 8 housing is doing no favor for those families, and that's why I think this is an appropriate amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chair, it is beyond my comprehension to conclude that because people are working and in need of housing assistance, they should be evicted from the very assistance they are paying for because they don't make enough money to move to a better home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm doing this not only for the people of my district, but I'm also doing this for the people in my colleague's district as well, because he has a deficit of 13,177 rental units for persons who are in need of this type of affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not housing for those who don't need it and who are not qualified. The elderly need it. The persons who are with low-income and very low-income need it, and those who are disabled. And for edification purposes, when we talk about persons with extremely low income, we are talking about persons who make at or below 30 percent of the area median income. And many of these persons are using 50 percent of what they earn on housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chair, I am appreciative of what the gentleman has offered, but I'm going to ask persons to please vote against this amendment and vote for the disabled, vote for the elderly, vote so that persons with low income and extremely low income can have affordable housing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer an amendment with my good friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who just offered the previous amendment, and I certainly associate myself with his efforts on the previous amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment represents what many of us consider to be a very, very important principle, and that fundamental important principle is if you're an able-bodied adult under the age of 62 receiving means-tested Federal assistance, you ought to be on the road to self-sufficiency. That's what this amendment is all about, and that's what the principle is. This, we believe, will further encourage people to make the transition from dependency upon section 8 rental assistance to self-sufficiency. Not  only is that important to them, it's important to the taxpayer who we're asking to pick up the tab. And this is, I believe, over a $2 billion bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, specifically, our amendment would require people receiving section 8 rental assistance for 7 consecutive years to perform a certain amount of work-related activities, which includes work, looking for work, job training, education and a host of other activities that are reflected in the TANF statute, which we mirror. There are a number of exemptions. It exempts those under age 18, over the age of 62, blind, disabled, those already working, already exempt under TANF, single parents of children  under six who are unable to find appropriate child care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 10 years ago, the Nation embarked on a bold new experiment with TANF, and we said that Federal assistance should be temporary and based on work and self-sufficiency and responsibility and personal dignity. That is a principle. Now many naysayers then said that it was mean. They said it was unworkable. Some even implied it was racist. Well, they were wrong then, and they are wrong now. Under TANF, the number of families receiving cash welfare steadily declined from a peak of 5.1 million families  in March of 1994 to 1.9 million families. Child poverty has fallen dramatically. The employment of young single mothers has doubled, and the employment of mothers who have never been married is up by more than 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the lessons are clear. But we didn't finish the job 10 years ago, and we should finish it. Again, this is a vote on a very simple principle. If you're an able-bodied adult receiving means-tested Federal assistance, should you be on the road to self-sufficiency? I believe the answer is yes.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have just heard the gentleman from Texas lay out a scenario that is ripe full of holes. This amendment is drastic. It is costly. It is inefficient. It affects all families and individuals currently using a voucher or living in section 8 project-based housing. It's impossible to administer. Even HUD and the administration itself has not even requested it. It imposes a new unfunded mandate on private sector landlords owning Federally assisted housing, forcing them to assume  the role of a welfare agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman talks about a boom on the taxpayers. This imposes a significant cost to taxpayers by raising the costs incurred by public housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have in my hands a letter from just about every housing and real estate and housing association in this country saying, in effect, that we are not able to support the Hensarling amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most exemplary of the ridiculousness of this amendment is that he asks for 20 hours of work, but doesn't say how, doesn't say when. Twenty hours when? Twenty hours a week? Twenty hours a month? Twenty hours a year? There is no way to administer it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Madam Chair, what is so hurtful to me about this amendment; yes, it is mean-spirited. But not only is it mean-spirited, my friend, it is, indeed, bigoted. It is, yes, a bigoted amendment. Let me tell you why. It reflects a very  stereotypical negative view of certain economic racial groups of poor people, poor families, because it singles them out for an ill-defined work requirement that does not apply to other families and individuals receiving Federal  assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment needs to be dealt with for what it really is, and quite honestly, it is an insult to the Congress of the United States. And I submit it is even beneath the dignity of the Congress of the United States to even entertain this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I thank the gentleman from Texas for his efforts to bring more accountability to the section 8 program. It's much needed and long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As welfare reform has shown us, the section 8 program should not become a way of life. It should be a helping hand, a way out of poverty. Ending the welfare cycle of dependency that has trapped so many has cut the welfare rolls in half, promoted individual responsibility and saved billions of tax dollars in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the primary engines that continues to drive the civic welfare reform is the requirement that those in the program must work, and that's all that this amendment does. To be clear, the Hensarling-Chabot amendment would simply require all able-bodied individuals who have received section 8 for more than 7 consecutive years to work. I don't see anything at all mean-spirited about that. I certainly don't see anything bigoted about that to say that if somebody is receiving tax dollars, they  ought to be required to work, to do something in consideration for the tax dollars that are being paid to help that person live while they need that assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the amendment, again, as the gentleman indicates, exempts those that are under 18 years of age, that are over 62 or blind or disabled, and those already exempt under TANF, and single parents of children under six. The amendment benefits the taxpayer and those in the section 8 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It requires work, and I think that's a good thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Texas still controls a half minute.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for coming down to support this important amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to fail to see what is mean-spirited about asking people, after 7 years, who get means-tested assistance, to be on the road to self-sufficiency, something good for them, something good for the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must admit, I really regret, Madam Chairman, that the gentleman from Georgia chose to characterize this as "bigoted." Perhaps I could have taken his words down. I sense when you run out of anything else to say, you characterize someone else's motivations and you use the term "bigoted." And that, I regret.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 minute.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me explain, if I may, Madam Chair, in closing. This is very personal to me. I've grown up in this country. I understand messages and I understand this message. This is a message that is targeted to a group of people, no matter how small they may be, who believe that certain people are categorized as wanting a handout, or that they are lazy, or that they don't want to work. So then the cry comes, before we can give them any help, make them work. Make them get a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, that is what this is about. In my humble opinion, 20 hours of work, not even defined, whether it is a day, whether it is a month, whether it is a week, no requirements in it, is an unfunded mandate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, Madam Chairman, there are already included in this bill a number of provisions to encourage work, to encourage self-sufficiency, including reduced work disincentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in closing, may I say, Madam Chairman, please vote against the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the intent of this motion to recommit is clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon adoption of this motion to recommit, we will go right to the adoption of the bill in its entirety to include the important language that ensures illegal immigrants are not benefitting from rental assistance provided by the section 8 program that is funded by the dollars of hard-working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The section 8 program has provided much needed rental assistance to low-income families who spend a high percentage of their income on housing costs since its creation in the 1970s. Today, there are approximately 2 million vouchers administered by the more than 2,500 public housing authorities in this country. The success of this program is now dominating HUD's budget, but we are looking for clear reform to ensure the viability of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit helps strengthen the section 8 program by ensuring that illegal immigrants cannot receive assistance from this program. This measure will simply require all occupants of a housing unit, supported by section 8, to establish proof of their legal residency through the use of secure forms of identification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are four options here: driver's license or REAL ID card; a foreign or U.S. passport; a citizens and immigration services photo ID card; or a Social Security card in conjunction with the State or Federal photo ID. Without this addition to this bill, illegal immigrants could utilize current loopholes to secure section 8 housing benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We absolutely cannot reward this illegal behavior with incentives for illegal immigrants to remain in the country in blatant violation of the law. By providing housing, we are simply encouraging the continuation of their illegal presence in our Nation. This is a form of back-door amnesty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been many stories across the country highlighting examples of benefits being granted to illegal immigrants. I believe, in 2006, in Denver, Colorado alone, there were an estimated 20,000 illegal immigrants holding FHA ensured loans. Each of these cases provides further incentives for illegal immigrants to remain in our Nation violating the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's immigration system is clearly broken. We must take this opportunity to strengthen a successful Federal program to ensure this benefit is only provided to legal residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people work too hard for their tax dollars to have them spent on illegal immigrants. I urge a "yes" vote on this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill has two parts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One part is to reiterate what is already the law. It is already the law that only people who are in the country legally may benefit from this. The second part is how to enforce it, and what it does is to continue an unfortunate tendency that goes counter to everything we have tried to do about privacy, of making the Social Security card a universal identifier, and there are real dangers in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members who have been concerned with privacy know that an unreasonable and unrestricted use of the Social Security card is a problem. Indeed, we have talked about legislation, bipartisan, to restrict the requirement that you give your Social Security number. But here is what this bill says. It does not change the law. It's already illegal for people who are not here legally to get these benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman mentioned 26,000 FHA loans in Colorado, zero section 8s. I haven't heard the evidence. I would be glad to listen to it. I will invite people, if there is evidence that this is a problem with section 8, let's listen to it. But here's what you impose on the housing authorities. There is now a requirement that people show that they are here legally. But now in this legislation, if it's adopted, would narrow that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here is what you would have to take to get someone who wanted to get into section 8:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They could show you their passport. The number of really poor people carrying passports is less than you might imagine. Although, I don't know what they might imagine, so I take that back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or a USCIS photo identification card. Well, if you are a citizen born in the United States, you don't have one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or a driver's license. You may not have a driver's license.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if you are an 82 year-old who doesn't travel a lot to foreign countries and you are an American citizen, what are you going to show them? Your Social Security card. What this does is put more legal emphasis behind that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to Members, Members can vote as they wish. But the next time people complain to you about privacy problems and about Social Security numbers floating around being misused, if you voted for this, say, yes, I helped, because that's what this does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only thing this adds to American law is a requirement that most people trying to get section 8s will have to show their Social Security card, because a lot of them won't have driver's licenses, and they won't have passports. If they are American citizens, they won't have that card. The most common form of identification required will be the Social Security card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working, the people in the Energy and Commerce Committee, the people in the Ways and Means Committee, we have all been working to restrict the idea that the Social Security card is an ID card. I thought that was fairly generally accepted, that we don't want the Social Security card to be the ID card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's the Federal Government saying here? Because, yes, you can say,  well, who wants to steal the identification of a poor person? You know, being up against a section 8, no big deal. But once the Federal Government, the minority has been consistently arguing, once we have stated the Social Security card is the most universally accepted, the Social Security card is considered to be the best form of identification, then what's the argument against every  business in America doing it? How do you stop this from becoming that universal identifier?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members can cover themselves by voting for something that's already in the law. It's time to cover yourself anyway; it's kind of late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But understand what Members will be doing. They will be furthering the practice of using the Social Security card as an identifier. They will be weakening our efforts to undercut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members may be unhappy to understand the implications of what they are doing. But I do not think it is wise for this House to continue a pattern of saying that the Social Security card will not just be a means of checking for Social Security but will become the universal identifier, that people will have to show it. Because if we, the Federal Government, say you have to show it, then how do you tell the hotel that they can't say it? How do you tell anybody else that they can't require the production  of Social Security cards?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The logical consequence of this will be a serious impediment to our efforts to protect privacy and to deal with identity theft. The unrestricted use of the Social Security card is a serious problem there, and this makes it worse.</paragraph>
