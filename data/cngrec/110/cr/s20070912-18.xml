  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="IN RECOGNITION OF THE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Madam President, children and animals are the most vulnerable of our Nation's population, as they do not have a voice of their own. Organizations which aid animals or children are very important in creating and maintaining a humane, safe and just society. That is why I rise today to honor and praise the American Humane Association on the occasion of its 130th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Humane Association is unique in America in that it is not only the oldest but the only national organization with the dual mission of protecting both animals and children. As a true American icon of humanity, the American Humane Association has been the voice of the most vulnerable both animals and children--for each and every one of its 13 decades of existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American Humane was formed on October 9, 1877, with the vital mission of protecting both children and animals from abuse, neglect, cruelty and exploitation. Over those years covering much of two centuries, American Humane has actively and successfully promoted humane values and education, built significant public awareness and understanding, and has developed programs and processes that effectively protect both children and animals. It has been a leader in advancing humanity in this Nation and  has been a model for the rest of the world to see and emulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among numerous other initiatives, American Humane, based in Denver, CO, originated such programs as "Be Kind to Animals Week," and "Tag Day," to educate the public on the need to treat animals humanely and to adequately identify their animals. American Humane is the only organization to monitor and certify the making of movies to ensure "No Animals Were Harmed." The organization also created "The Front Porch Project," an initiative to educate communities on how to protect children from  abuse, and it was the world's first organization to identify "The Link" between animal abuse and human violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for American Humane's continuing good work in advancing humanity on a national scale. The United States of America is greatly enriched by the ongoing work of American Humane Association, and I congratulate the Association on this significant historical milestone.</paragraph>
