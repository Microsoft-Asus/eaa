    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I strongly support the prescription drug bill that will be coming up today for a vote. I commend the leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor as a central part of the first 100 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Medicare drug bill was being assembled, the pharmaceutical lobby convinced its authors to write rules into the bill that would forbid ever negotiating for lower-cost prescription drugs. These drug companies  charged American consumers far more than anyone else in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill today would allow the Secretary to negotiate for lower-cost prescription drugs. This is a commonsense solution that could have enormous cost savings for seniors and the government. The VA Administration already does this effectively; so does every other industrialized country in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own State of Maine has led the way in implementing this approach at the State level. I have introduced my America Rx bill based on Maine's approach in the past Congresses. I am so pleased that this bill today does that same thing, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
