    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the immigration bill. We have the two managers of the bill here. There will be two amendments from each side to be offered today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in anticipation of coming back the week after our break, which starts this afternoon, we are going to finish the immigration bill. I hope that we will not have to file cloture. There have been enough amendments offered. I hope we can have a final vote on passage. If things are not going well on Tuesday and Wednesday when we get back, I will consider filing cloture. I will certainly discuss this in detail with the Republican leader, Senator McConnell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made a lot of progress on this bill. It is according to whose view you have as to whether it is forward or backward. As far as I am concerned, the bipartisan agreement that was reached by Democrats and Republicans has put us on a path for resolving one of America's big problems, immigration.</paragraph>
