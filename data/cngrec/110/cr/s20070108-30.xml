  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is an honor indeed to pay tribute to a number of fine individuals who I am fortunate to call not just my colleagues, but also dear friends: Senators Bill Frist, George Allen, Conrad Burns, Lincoln Chafee, Mike DeWine, Rick Santorum and Jim Talent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the greatest losses to the Senate is the departure of our majority leader, Dr. Bill Frist. I first became acquainted with Bill when he called me during my time as president of the American Red Cross to say that he would travel to Africa with us to volunteer as a surgeon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back then, I immediately recognized Bill's intelligence, integrity and compassion for others. I saw how dedicated he was about sound policy--especially  health care policy--and how dedicated he was to helping those most in need, whether they be in America, in Africa, or anywhere in the world. And I saw how his colleagues quickly came to respect him, to rely on his judgment, and to value his counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fall of 2001, when terrorism hit home in the United States Capitol, we saw how Bill's colleagues immediately turned to him for his guidance and expertise, and Bill responded to the challenge. For example, he quickly transformed his Senate website into the best source of information for Senate staff on the issues surrounding possible anthrax exposure. And he was willing to speak with each and every Member of the Senate community to allay concerns with accurate medical information. Bill  utilized his expertise to write legislation to help protect the entire Nation from the scourge of bioterrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 2 years, I was honored to serve as a member of Bill's leadership team. As our leader, Bill displayed extraordinary integrity, care and thoughtfulness in dealing with every Senator, and he worked tirelessly to bring together his colleagues for the betterment of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill's record of achievement as our majority leader is exemplary. As a result of his steady leadership, we succeeded in securing historic tax relief that has helped put more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans while paving the way for today's stunning economic recovery. His leadership improved life for our seniors by lowering the cost of prescription drugs. He helped spearhead important reforms of our tort system and bankruptcy code. Under Bill's leadership, we passed a comprehensive  energy bill that reduces our reliance on foreign oil. And to help keep our Nation's fiscal house in order, Bill led the fight to pass a landmark deficit reduction plan that put some brakes on mandatory Federal spending. Perhaps most importantly, Bill's leadership was indispensable in helping place men and women on our Federal courts, including the United States Supreme Court, who will strictly interpret the law rather than try to legislate from the bench.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Bill's 12 years in the Senate, our Nation faced many challenges and many changes. But Bill retained his strong sense of direction, his dedication to reaching out to those most in need, and his devotion to his family--Karyn, Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan. As he has done in medicine and in public service, I know that in future endeavors Bill will continue to serve and help his fellow man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has also been a privilege to serve alongside my good friend and colleague, Senator George Allen. In the Senate, George built on an already remarkable record of service to the people of Virginia, where he served as a Member of the House of Delegates, a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives and as one of the most respected and successful Governors in the history of the Commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Senator, George continued his common sense, "Jeffersonian" style of conservative leadership. He proved time and again that he is a tremendous ally of Virginia's defense communities and military families. In 2005, George was a strong proponent of helping families of fallen soldiers by raising the death gratuity for next-of-kin from $12,000 to $100,000. And as a member of the Commerce Committee, George Allen was the Senate leader in working to maintain America's competitive advantage in  technology and innovation. George founded the Senate Competitiveness Caucus to promote an agenda that ensures that the United States continues to create high paying jobs and produce the very best engineers and scientists in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of George's best attributes as a Senator was that he did more than just talk the talk--George delivered real results. He advocated for increased funding for math and science education, in particular at historically black colleges and other minority institutions. He has been a leader in the Senate on improving health savings accounts by increasing the amount individuals can contribute each year to their HSAs, thus allowing them to save more money for current and future health care needs. George  also secured more than $3.5 million in Federal funding for cutting-edge nanotechnology research and development. And he led the fight to ban Internet access taxes and make the internet tax moratorium permanent, as he understands that saddling consumers with high taxes will stifle innovation and expand the digital divide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, George Allen has served the people of Virginia with courage and distinction, and he has provided a wonderful example for public servants who follow in his footsteps. I wish all the best to George, his dear wife Susan, and their three children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 18 years, Montanans were extremely fortunate to be represented by Conrad Burns. There is no question that Conrad delivered time and again for the people of his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Conrad secured more than $2 billion in Federal funds for Montana. And as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, he was a tireless advocate of programs that benefit all Montanans, such as protecting drinking water and defending his State's wilderness and wildlife. Conrad also fought hard for Malmstrom Air Force Base and Montana's military presence during the base realignment and closure process in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the communications subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, Conrad fought for deregulation and new Internet and mobile phone technologies. And he  worked to ensure that rural Montana communities have access to the technologies that will keep them competitive in today's global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his time in the Senate, Conrad was a strong proponent of government accountability, fiscal responsibility and lower taxes. He worked diligently to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil. And he was an early backer of the Medicare prescription drug benefit that is now helping millions of seniors afford their medicines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conrad's legacy will live on, across Montana, and in the halls of the Senate, long after he has shut the door to his office. He leaves behind an extraordinary record of service to the people of his State. My warmest wishes to my friend Conrad Burns, his wife Phyllis, and their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lincoln Chaffee also will be greatly missed in this Chamber. lin served the people of Rhode Island with the utmost honor, integrity and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have great respect for lin Chafee for his commitment to the principles of personal freedom, individual responsibility and fiscal discipline. Well-known for his reputation as a fierce deficit hawk, he has been a vocal advocate for responsible government spending, and a strong supporter of abolishing the marriage tax penalty and increasing the child tax credit. Linc also took a very active interest in promoting the health care of women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln Chafee also has been tirelessly dedicated to improving his home state. As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, he secured more than $1 billion in Federal funding for Rhode Island's infrastructure, including the Warwick Station project and the development of the East Providence shoreline. And as chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Water, he worked diligently to protect air and water quality in his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linc was a principled, independent Member, adamant about doing what he believed was right for the families he represented. Throughout his Senate career, he demonstrated a willingness to listen to all sides of an issue and work with members of both political parties. He is a man who speaks his mind, votes his conscience, and treats others with the dignity and respect they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linc is a refreshing politician, a diligent public servant, and a devoted family man to his wife Stephanie and their three children. It goes without saying that my colleagues in the Senate--and the people of Rhode Island--will greatly miss Senator Lincoln Chafee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the Senate's most effective legislators, Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio will use his many talents and expertise to tackle new endeavors. Mike's career is truly an American success story. As a boy, he learned the values of hard work and perseverance in the  fields and the mill of his family's small agricultural business in Yellow Springs, OH. It is those principles that have guided him throughout a stellar career in public service, in which he has served  as prosecutor, an Ohio State Senator, a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and as Lieutenant Governor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Senator, Mike made his mark in a number of policy areas. He was a strong proponent of education and children's health care. In particular, he advocated for children's hospitals because he understands that these hospitals are important centers for pediatric research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During more than a decade of service on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike worked doggedly to investigate intelligence failures and revamp our intelligence community. As the chairman of the Retirement Security and Aging Subcommittee of the HELP Committee, he focused his efforts on modernizing our Nation's pension system. And as the first Ohio Senator in six decades to serve on the Appropriations Committee, Mike was committed to ensuring that our Nation's first responders have the resources  they need. On the Judiciary Committee, Mike took the lead on a number of antiterror and anticrime initiatives, such as the Patriot Act, as well as proposals to curb drunk driving, to help keep all Americans safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps what I admire most about Mike is that this terrific father of eight, and grandfather of nine, always puts his family first. As a public servant, Mike has used his positions to contribute to the greater good, and he has brilliantly served the people of Ohio throughout his career. May God bless Mike DeWine, his wife Fran, and their family for many, many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes without saying that it pulls at my heartstrings to bid farewell to Senator Rick Santorum. On issue after issue--tax relief, education, affordable health care, national security Rick has stood tall for Pennsylvanians and all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick is a man of conviction, deep faith, and integrity--qualities instilled in him growing up in Pennsylvania as the son of an Italian immigrant. He doesn't beat around the bush, and you never have to wonder where he stands. His word is his bond, and he expresses his views with great passion and expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since his early days in the Senate, Rick was an inspirational leader. One of the qualities I admired most about him as a legislator was that he never was one to dodge the tough issues; in fact, he readily took the lead on those issues and set out to find solutions to very serious challenges. For example, he spearheaded the passage of welfare reform in 1996, which to date has helped more than 1 million Americans go from receiving welfare checks to paychecks. Rick fought hard for No Child Left  Behind, and as a result, today math and reading scores in Pennsylvania schools are on the rise. He also fought hard to ensure that all Pennsylvanians have access to high quality, affordable health care. He is a strong supporter of Federal cancer research, including increased funding</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Rick was one of Congress's most dedicated and knowledgeable Members when it came to developing antipoverty initiatives. He was the driving force behind legislation that would provide a tremendous boost to charitable-giving through a series of targeted tax incentives aimed at helping the homeless, the drug addicted, and the less fortunate in our society. And he committed himself to working to eradicate the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. In short, Rick Santorum is the embodiment of what  it means to be a compassionate conservative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick was so attentive to the needs of those he represented and always put Pennsylvania first. For example, he helped secure $100 million to build America's first ever coal to ultra-clean fuel plant in Pennsylvania, which not only creates jobs but also provides more affordable energy and benefits the environment. I often joked with Rick that he should hold another title, the "Mayor of Pennsylvania." It's no surprise that he made it a point each year to visit all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. On so many issues, Rick has been a principled advocate for his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Rick works incredibly hard, there is no question that he is first and foremost a dedicated family man to his wife Karen and their six children. It has been a privilege indeed to work closely with Rick--sometimes literally, as our offices were on the same hall. He is an all-around class act, and with his numerous accomplishments and exemplary record of service to his constituents, he will certainly be a tough act to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Jim Talent has been an outstanding representative of the people of Missouri. A dedicated public servant, he served for 8 years in the State House of Representatives, as well as 8 years in the U.S. House. Jim was the lead author in the House of the landmark 1996 welfare reform bill that has moved more than a million Americans off welfare and into work and self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim is man of impeccable character and a natural leader, and in the Senate he held a number of leadership posts in his freshman term--as the chairman of the Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, as the chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection, and Product Promotion, and as a deputy whip. He also demonstrated a remarkable ability to make things happen legislatively, with many of his bills passed by Congress and signed into law. Jim's amazing legislative record reflects  not just his abilities but also the respect he earned from his colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim delivered on his promises to Missourians to help create jobs, grow the economy and strengthen our national defense. He also worked to improve health care, and he advocated on behalf of those who suffer from sickle cell disease and breast cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been my pleasure to serve with Jim on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have seen him in action and know that there is no one more committed to ensuring that our country's defenses remain strong. I was proud to work closely with him to enact legislation to prevent predatory lenders from targeting our brave men and women in uniform and their families. There is no question that he is a steadfast supporter of our service members, their families, and their livelihood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Chamber needs more members like Jim, who understand that the only way to really make a difference is to put partisan concerns aside and work across the aisle. Throughout his public service career, Jim Talent has certainly made a positive difference, and he will surely be missed in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As these men--Bill Frist, George Allen, Conrad Burns, Lincoln Chafee, Mike DeWine, Rick Santorum and Jim Talent--conclude their service in the U.S. Senate, let me say that I am so proud to have worked with individuals of such character, strength, and intellect. Our Nation is grateful for their many contributions. And as they each will undoubtedly continue to contribute to our country's greatness, their leadership and vision will be missed here in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
