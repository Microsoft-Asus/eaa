  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important resolution designating the 30th day of April 2007 as "D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os: Celebrating Young Americans."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nations throughout the world, and especially within Latin America, celebrate D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os on the 30th of April, in recognition and celebration of their countries' future--their children. Many American Hispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on this day by celebrating D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designation of a day to honor the children of the Nation will help us affirm the significance of family, education, and community. This special recognition of children will provide us with an opportunity to reflect on their futures, articulate their dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security in the support of their family members and communities. This resolution calls on the American people to join with all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and states  across the Nation to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. In the past years in my state of Utah, there have been a number of events and special programs for D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os in schools, libraries, cultural centers, and even hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joining me as original cosponsors to this Resolution are Mel Martinez, Jeff Bingaman, Ken Salazar, Robert Menendez, and Barbara Boxer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this resolution.</paragraph>
