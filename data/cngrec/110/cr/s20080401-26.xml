    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor and share with my colleagues the memory of a very special man, Arthur Lyons of Palm Springs, who died March 21, 2008. He was 62 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur Lyons was a man of many talents and will be fondly remembered for his groundbreaking work with film noir cinema, his success as an author, his dedication to the city of Palm Springs, and his love for the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur was born on January 5, 1946, in Los Angeles, CA. His family moved to Palm Springs when Arthur was 11. After graduating from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1967, Arthur tapped into his lifelong passion for film noir and began writing as a novelist, a screenwriter for Universal Studios, and as a cofounder of the Writers Conference, among other projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur wrote his first novel, "The Dead Are Discreet", in 1974 and went on to author 23 more books, many of them mystery novels, including the successful Jacob Ashe detective series. His nonfiction sensation, "Death on the Cheap: The Lost B Movies of Film Noir", reflected his interest in film noir cinema, the traditional Hollywood crime dramas of the 1940s and 1950s. After writing crime novels for over 25 years, Arthur partnered with Craig Prater in 2001 to launch the Palm Springs Film Noir  Festival--one of the first such festivals in the Nation. A man of unbridled enthusiasm for the film noir style, Arthur would encourage attendees to dress up in mobster-style clothing that was typical of that Hollywood era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A member of the Palm Springs City Council from 1992 to 1995, Arthur was an advocate of energy deregulation in California and helped create Palm Springs Energy Services. During his time on the city council, Arthur also helped to create Palm Springs Villagefest, a street fair held every Thursday that hosts food booths, a certified farmer's market, and craft and artisan booths. In recognition of his positive contributions to the Palm Springs community, Arthur was honored with the 287th Golden Palm  Star on May 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knew Arthur Lyons recognized him as a uniquely passionate and brilliant man. He took pride in promoting causes that he held close to his heart. His work as an author, screenwriter, director, and elected official will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives he touched. He will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur is survived by his wife Barbara Lyons and his uncle David Lyons.</paragraph>
