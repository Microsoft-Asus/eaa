  <narrative>CONGRESS, LET'S GET TO WORK -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15321]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, growing up, my mother taught me that two wrongs don't make a right. For months, Congress has failed to meet its budget deadlines, and now House leadership is trying to make up for the inefficiency with a massive pork-filled spending bill to fund our Federal Government. This is inside-the-beltway political gamesmanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans want change, and I came to Washington to fight the status quo. House leadership is essentially blackmailing the American people by saying it will only support our troops and veterans if its budget-busting, deficit-spending initiatives are funded. With high gas prices, rising health care costs and economic insecurity, the last thing Michigan families need is more out-of-control government spending. People back home in Michigan know higher spending equals higher taxes, which is the last  thing our hardworking families need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's get to work, give our troops fighting the war on terror the resources they need, support our veterans, and show true fiscal restraint with taxpayer dollars by keeping spending in check.</paragraph>
