    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a small business whose admirable goal is to educate citizens about personal finance. The Institute for Financial Literacy, headquartered in Maine's largest city of Portland, provides a valuable and unique resource for taxpayers and business owners alike--specifically those who have gone through bankruptcy--to better understand their economic situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 2002 by Leslie Linfield, the Institute for Financial Literacy has grown exponentially in the past 6 years, and now has a team of 50 employees. The institute employs a multitude of programs and formats to train clients on various issues related to the betterment of financial aptitude. Its Personal Finance Series is a combination of three books that aim to demonstrate the principles of budgeting, credit and debit management, and investment and retirement planning. The company's Web site  contains several instrumental tools, including a budget worksheet and a financial goal action plan, free for anyone wishing to monitor their finances closely. The Web site includes several papers on legal matters and money management strategies by the company's employees. Additionally, it offers users the ability to sign up for the institute's electronic newsletter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above and beyond the invaluable information provided on its Web page, the institute provides critical counseling services to assist those in need of financial advice. In 2007 alone, the institute's employees served over 50,000 individuals throughout the country, helping them make better and more informed decisions about their personal financial decisions. Services for people who have filed for bankruptcy include both pre- and post-filing FreshStart counseling and education programs, all delivered  over the Internet, phone, or in person, to give clients the financial management skills and principles necessary to succeed in their future endeavors. To make its employees' expertise available to the largest number of people, the institute is open for 13 hours each weekday with additional hours on Saturdays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the institute partners with nonprofit, educational and governmental organizations to integrate its programs into their existing services. These partners include groups with a notable influence in the realm of financial responsibility, including the "Save For Your Future" campaign that urges Americans to develop private individual pensions to supplement their Social Security earnings, and the American Bankruptcy Institute, an organization dedicated to research and education on matters  related to insolvency. Similarly, the Institute for Financial Literacy has partnered with local organizations to create programs that help Mainers improve their financial and employment opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its short history, the Institute for Financial Literacy has already benefited tens of thousands of people struggling to recover from bankruptcy. By developing high-quality, user-friendly financial literacy programs, its educational and counseling assistance renders an enormous boon for those looking to advance in life. I thank Leslie  Linfield and all of the institute's employees for their generous help to those in need and applaud them for their dedicated  service to producing a more financially sound populace.</paragraph>
