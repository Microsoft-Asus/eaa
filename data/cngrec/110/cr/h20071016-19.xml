    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, many House Republicans have mistakenly bought into President Bush's false rhetoric about the CHIP program and its reauthorization. I would hope that they would listen to their Senate Republican colleagues who are willing to see past the White House rhetoric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Senator Corker from Tennessee said, "What will move our country towards socialized medicine is not this bill, which focuses on poor children, but the lack of action to allow people in need to have access to private affordable health care."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Senator Roberts of Kansas said, "I'm not for excessive spending and I strongly oppose the federalization of health care. And if the administration's concerns about this bill were accurate, I would support a veto. But, bluntly, they are not."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Republican Senator Hatch from Utah thinks the President "has been sold a bill of goods" on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the House Republicans should not buy into the administration's falsehoods. This week, we have an opportunity to ensure 10 million children have access to quality health insurance. They should join us in overriding the President's veto.</paragraph>
