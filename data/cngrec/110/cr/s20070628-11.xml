    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, let me pay homage to the senior Senator from West Virginia who, in a typically eloquent way, spoke to the Senate about his long service to his State. Let me tell the people of West Virginia, they don't need to worry; they have a very strong Senator in this body. Any comments about his age are misplaced, because his passion and his intellectual heft and his knowledge of history and the Constitution far outweigh any considerations one would have about  his age.</paragraph>
