  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="781">H.R. 781</bill>, offered by my colleague, Mr. Ross of Arkansas, to redesignate lock and dam No. 5 of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System as the Colonel Charles D. Maynard Lock and Dam. The bill has the support of the entire Arkansas delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Maynard made an undeniable contribution to the State of Arkansas through his professional duties and social services. Educated at West Point, he was the district engineer of the Little Rock Engineer District for 3 years, where he oversaw the planning, design and construction of the 13 locks and dams on the McClellan-Kerr. At the time, this was the largest civil works project ever undertaken in the State of Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To this day, the locks and dams provide inland waterway transportation for commerce and well-paying jobs for many of the residents of Arkansas. Billions of dollars in goods move through the State's ports each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Maynard was an integral connection between the project and Congress: he provided congressional testimony in support of McClellan-Kerr, and he consistently met the deadlines our body designated for the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his work promoting waterborne transportation in Arkansas, Colonel Maynard was appointed by three separate Governors to serve on the Arkansas Waterways Commission. He served on the commission for 21 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His civil roles included a variety of leadership positions for charity groups to better our society and for groups such as the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce to help promote business in his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Colonel Maynard passed away October 22, 2005, he remains a symbol of how best to engineer our  civil works projects for the benefit of all. His memory could also be used to call attention to the vital role inland waterways have for our economy, and remind us of the improvements and necessary maintenance projects needed for our commerce on these rivers to thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting <bill type="h" number="781">H.R. 781</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Arkansas River system provides navigation, flood protection, hydropower, water supply and recreation for millions of Americans. This body of water provides a 9-foot navigation channel that is almost 445 miles long and is controlled over this length by 17 locks and dams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, lock and dam No. 5, which this legislation would name after Colonel Charles Maynard, became operational in 1968. This is a vital piece of infrastructure where almost 9 million tons of commodities pass through it annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to his work as district engineer in Little Rock, Arkansas, Colonel Maynard served in the Army in New Guinea and the Philippines during World War II and later supported the Berlin airlift as an engineer in charge of construction at Keflavik Field in Iceland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Colonel Maynard oversaw many of the Army Corps of Engineers construction projects along the Arkansas River. Under his watch, Colonel Maynard directed the construction of 13 of the 17 locks along the river.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to his military education, management skills and World War II experience, he was uniquely qualified for his assignment as the Little Rock district engineer. This designation is an appropriate honor for Colonel Maynard's achievements and contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support <bill type="h" number="781">H.R. 781</bill>.</paragraph>
