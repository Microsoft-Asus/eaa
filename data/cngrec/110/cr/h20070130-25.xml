    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I must admit that I was somewhat encouraged in December when the newly minted Democrat majority announced that they were considering a bill that would simply finish this year's budget work with what is known as a continuing resolution, funding the government at current levels and leaving the debate over the budget for the ordinary process of the constitutional system of the legislature. I was particularly enamored with the idea that they would move this so-named continuing  resolution without earmarks, and I am pleased to have supported bipartisan earmark reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what will come to the floor tomorrow, to my disappointment, is not a bill that simply continues the funding of the government. It is a new Federal budget: $463 billion in spending, 137 pages. Madam Speaker, it will take 300 pages to read the CBO score. What we see is not a continuation of government spending. We see, rather, the death of deliberation. The Congress is witnessing in the first hours of this new session the death of a long-term process whereby our budgets and our legislation  are considered. It is the death of deliberation that must be put to an end.</paragraph>
