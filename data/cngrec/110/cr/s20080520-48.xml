    <paragraph>Mr. President, from May 3-5, 2008, more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington, DC to take part in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals. We the People is the most extensive educational program in the country developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Washington, the students took part in a 3-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they "testify" before a panel of judges. Students demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluated, assumed, and defended positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. It is important to note that results of independent studies of this nationally acclaimed program reveal that We the People students have knowledge  gains that are superior to comparison students. Students also display a greater political tolerance and commitment to the principles and values of the Constitution and Bill of Rights than do students using traditional textbooks and approaches. With many reports and surveys indicating the lack of civic knowledge and civic participation, I am pleased to support such a superb program that is producing an enlightened and engaged citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to announce that a class from Elkins High School in Missouri City, represented the State of Texas at this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the names of these outstanding students from Elkins High School are: Krystal Castillo, Andrea Cavazos, Deborah Choate, Andrew Cockroft, Lucretia Eiler, Jimmy Guerrero, Josh Hanks, Lara Hogue, Nick Johnson, Tiffany Kell, Curtis Kelso, D.J. Kinneman, Matt MacKo, Colton Mendez, Jonny Murthy, Olusola Oyewuwo, Tej Pandya, Bryan Philpott, Justina Rodriguez, Deepa Sabu, Nick Shipman, Piarose Siaotong, Ivette Soto, Achal Upadhyaya, Courtney Wiliams, Angela Wu, and Arif Yusuf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Marilyn Ellington, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the National Finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Jan Miller, the State coordinator who is responsible for implementing the We the People program in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate these students on their exceptional success at the We the People national finals.</paragraph>
