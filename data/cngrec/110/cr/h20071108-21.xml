  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to bid a fond farewell to a member of my staff, Brian Eisele. Brian will be leaving our office to join the staff of South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. Although I will miss his presence, I am confident Brian will be a tremendous addition to Senator DeMint's staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brian came to the Hill earlier this year as an intern for Congressman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. His hard work, professionalism, thoughtfulness and personal integrity have been an enormous asset to the people of the 2nd District of South Carolina. He will certainly be difficult to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A graduate of the University of South Carolina, Brian is the son of David, an Iraq war veteran, and Denise Eisele of Aiken, South Carolina. South Carolina is proud of its native son, and I'm excited for Brian's success. I wish him all the best in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brian has a bright future as a capable and competent public servant, and I look forward to working with him in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
