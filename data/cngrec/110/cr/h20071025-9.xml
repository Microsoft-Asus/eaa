    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great privilege to be able to rise on the floor of the House today to challenge all of our colleagues to stand for our children. We are going to do it again, and that is to put on the floor of the House the Children's Health Insurance Program, $35 billion for 10 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty days in Iraq will equal insuring 10 million children in giving them and providing uninsured low-income children with health care, insuring the lowest income children, pregnant women will be covered. Parents will not be covered. Mental health will be covered. Preventative care, saving the lives of our children, giving them the opportunity for a vigorous and prosperous future. Protecting our soldiers on the front lines when they can't pay for their children's health insurance. This has to  be the road we take, the journey to help our children. Let us do it in a bipartisan manner, joining with two Houses, putting it on the desk of the President of the United States. What will this Nation do for her most precious resource? I hope we will pass the SCHIP bill together, united for all of our children.</paragraph>
