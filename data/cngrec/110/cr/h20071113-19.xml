  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3703">H.R. 3703</bill>. This is a very timely and important piece of legislation because as you may recall, the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 requires retailers, including vending machines that are located on Federal property, to both accept and disburse $1 coins by January of 2008. We are talking about 7 weeks from now. That brings about the urgency and the timeliness of the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This requirement additionally applies to transit systems, military bases, and those that take Federal subsidies. Now, while most vending machines are already programmed and able to accept $1 coins, there are very few that are programmed to dispense $1 coins. So that is why this legislation is needed, to exempt those vending machines from dispensing requirements that do not have a reason to dispense the $1 coins in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that in effect, Mr. Speaker, if we do not pass this bill, we will have unintendedly affected a hindrance of the circulation of the coins by compelling them to be stored in vending machines that will never dispense them. This legislation targets machines that have only $1 in currency and exchange. So you can see there will never be a need for the machine to dispense $1 coins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe that these Presidential $1 coins are very important. They should be circulated. The public should circulate them, but certainly having them stored in a vending machine from which they will never be dispensed is not the way to do that. That is why we need this bill. I ask that the House urgently pass this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague from Georgia in support of this legislation. This legislation is simple and direct, and as my colleague stated, is necessary. It is basically a technical correction for the Presidential $1 Coin Act enacted in December 2005. That bill sought to use the mechanism of a regularly changed design on the $1 coin to draw that coin into circulation, and it had specific language directing that retail operations on Federal property, including vending machines,  accept and dispense $1 coins. It makes sense since the coin is an official form of U.S. exchange, and not to handle the coin would be inappropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But certain vending machines, such as soda machines, only accept change and bank notes of no greater value than $1. Logically, there would be no reason for these machines to dispense a $1 coin. To convert them to do so and to stock them with a stack of coins that never would be dispensed clearly would be unnecessary and not intended by the original bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Worse, as my friend from Georgia mentioned, oftentimes that cost for doing so would fall on our servicemen and women. So there really is no point to this change that was mandated, and we can easily fix that today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the language of this bill exempts solely those $1 vending machines from the requirement to dispense $1 coins. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I commend my colleague from Georgia for bringing this bill to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
