    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to move to the Amtrak bill. There is an understanding that I have with Senator Lott that a number of Members on the Republican side want to be able to have a little extra time to do some amendments dealing with this bill. There are no games being played with this legislation. This is something which is long overdue, and we want to complete this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 158, <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, the Amtrak authorization measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say this. We have a lot to do here. For people who are concerned with why we haven't been doing things this afternoon, it takes time getting things done, and I appreciate that. This is a bipartisan effort to move forward on this legislation. It is something I think we can do. There is no effort to do anything other than get a bill passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had a conversation with Senator Lott and with two other Republican Senators, and we have agreements with what we have talked about with them. It is a gentleman's agreement, but we will live up to it on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there will be no more votes today. We hope there will be a good debate on this important issue today and hope there will be some amendments offered tomorrow and Friday.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="TITLE IV--IMPROVED RAIL SECURITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our bill has been sent to the desk, and I want to start off by saying that I am pleased, obviously, that the Senate is considering <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first thing I want to do is to say thanks to my friend and chief cosponsor of the bill, Senator TRENT LOTT. We have worked together on matters related to transportation in the past, and there is no question that he understands the potential for passenger rail, and his long-standing efforts to improve our country's transportation systems are well known and deeply appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like him, I believe this is a critical moment--with delays, unavailability of reliable planning for work, personal opportunity to spend time with kids and family or other activities of choice. Anyone who spends any significant time on our roads does not need reminders that highway congestion is a major problem. In almost every city and town of any size throughout our country, it is experienced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent study by the Texas Transportation Institute showed that highway congestion costs our country over $78 billion per year, including $4.2 billion in lost productivity and 2.9 billion gallons of wasted fuel and an indeterminable loss in the quality of our lives. These things all cascade upon us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congestion, however, isn't just limited to our roads. One in four flights was late last year at our airports. At Newark Liberty International Airport, it is almost one in two flights. Other metropolitan regions are experiencing worsening delays. The DOT finally had to cap the number of flights at Chicago's O'Hare Airport a couple of years ago and is considering doing the same thing for Newark and Kennedy Airport in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even airlines are throwing in the towel. The 38 minutes in the air between here and New York City is now scheduled to take almost 2 hours, gate to gate. It is on the schedule--38 minutes of flying time and almost 2 hours to make the trip. It is outrageous. Coupled with long security lines, these delays make air travel increasingly stressful and inconvenient. How about those who are stranded in airplanes, for sometimes as long as 9 hours--stuck in an airplane without the amenities that necessarily  should be there, like food and potable water and working restrooms and so forth?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone knows what a difficult day going to the airport can be, or that air travel can be like. Further, everyone knows that the high price of gas has created economic hardship for so many Americans. Some experienced voices are predicting that oil prices in the future, not too distant, can be as high as $200 a barrel, more than twice the current price. One reason why the United States is addicted to oil, as President Bush puts it, is because the Government has not provided other options for  travelers. Where reliable rail service is available, people will run to the trains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's passenger railroad, Amtrak, has enjoyed record ridership over the past several years and set a new company record of almost 26 million passengers in the last year. More travelers take the train between Washington and New York City than fly on all the airlines combined between these cities. Amtrak is so popular in the Northeast because people can count on being on time; it is reliable service and it is economical and comfortable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see similar results outside of the Northeast corridor, where frequent and reliable passenger service is available. I can tell you from personal experience that riding the train can be a pleasurable experience. Passengers can use their laptops, talk on the phone, have a bite and be productive and not be exhausted when they get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, in most instances, rail service delivers passengers directly to where they need to go in the heart of a city. What a difference that is. You don't have to spend a half hour or an hour to get to the airport a half hour or an hour before the plane takes off so you are ready when the flight is ready to leave. Good passenger rail service is not only good transportation policy, but it is something people in this country are rushing to use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone is aware now also of the danger of pollution. In the battle against global warming, which is enveloping our country, with erratic weather raising havoc, rail is one of the most effective weapons. To move one passenger a mile, Amtrak emits slightly more than half of the carbon dioxide that airlines do and less than cars as well. Americans want a cleaner option in the air and the water for their children, grandchildren, and future generations than this constant assault on healthy air and  water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a time where conserving energy and reducing our dependency on foreign oil has never been more important, passenger rail service offers significant fuel-saving benefits. In a time when oil imports continue to expand while prices rise, the quality of life in America is being substantially eroded by these high prices. According to the Department of Energy, airlines on the average consume over 20 percent more energy than Amtrak to move a passenger one mile, while we search for ways to fight against  poisoning our atmosphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passenger rail is not just a matter of convenience. It is also an important security asset. One of the lessons we learned on 9/11 was that our country cannot afford to rely on any single mode of transportation. When our aviation system shut down that terrible day, September 11, and for days thereafter, Amtrak was a principal way to reunite thousands of travelers with their families. We also saw chaotic evacuations during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with resulting floods, with evacuating motorists  stuck for hours and some without cars were left behind altogether. Some investigations showed that with better preparation, passenger trains could have been used to help move thousands out of harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that rail service can help move our citizens to safety during emergencies, but you can't do it without the trains and the track that are part of the system. Other nations around the world understand these benefits and, unfortunately, we have been lagging behind. I will never forget a trip I took from Paris to Brussels. There are 18 trains a day between these two cities. You cannot get an airplane that goes between the two. The 210-mile trip takes about 85 minutes. Think about it,  210 miles taking 85 minutes, with trains leaving practically every hour. If you go to Union Station here and travel approximately 210 miles, it is a 3-hour or 2 3/4 -hour train ride. We can do so much better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Europeans are not better at these things than we are. They are not smarter than we are. But from Spain to Germany, they have simply made the wise decision to invest in passenger rail. These investments extend worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taiwan recently opened its $15 billion, 208-mile rail line this year, where riders can travel its length, 208 miles, in 90 minutes--approximately the length of the trip between Washington, DC, and New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits of these systems are obvious to anyone who travels there. We need the same world-class system in this country. The potential of new rail corridors in our country is enormous. Higher speed, more frequent rail service between Chicago and other Midwestern cities, such as St. Louis, Detroit, and Milwaukee, would revolutionize the way people travel in an entire region of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, expanded rail service between Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, and Washington would allow people options besides having to brave traffic and trucks on Interstate 95.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded that the train service between</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, called the Cascades line, is enjoying tremendous ridership, over 600,000 passengers each and every year. It is an invaluable asset. We see something similar in California between San Diego and Los Angeles, where over two and a half million people took the train this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is enthusiasm for passenger rail service in America, and States are planning rail corridors throughout the country. They are prepared to spend their limited funding for rail projects. But our Federal policies encourage them to build more roads. That is why we need to pass this bill that Senator Lott and I have presented. Our bill paves the way for an improved modern passenger rail network. It authorizes funding for Amtrak's capital needs as well as State grants for passenger rail.  We already make a significant investment in roads. We spend $40 billion a year. By comparison, we spend almost half that amount on airports and air traffic control towers. Our bill will start to address this investment gap by authorizing nearly $2 billion a year for Amtrak in the States that participate over the next 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A yearly average of $237 million of this money will be used to create a new State grant program for rail projects. Our Amtrak bill also funds the rehabilitation of Amtrak's Northeast corridor and mandates that Amtrak work with the Department of Transportation and the States to develop plans to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also requires changes at Amtrak--Senator Lott pursued this diligently--to make sure these funds will help the railroad continue moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we had record ridership and revenues last year, we can still improve its efficiency and management practices. That is why our bill would require Amtrak to reform its operations to reduce its Federal operating subsidy by 40 percent over the life of the bill. It also, at the suggestion of the Department of Transportation's inspector general, will allow the Federal Government to refinance Amtrak's $3 billion in outstanding debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, we are hitting so many of the areas of concern: it not only addresses the funding, but it also helps the management to focus on getting this railroad in a condition that it should be in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of these major reforms is for Amtrak to develop a new financial accounting system, which will provide more transparency into the company's financial management and better cost controls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, the LAUTENBERG-LOTT Amtrak bill focuses on improving service for passengers. I learned when I was in the private sector that if you provide a good product, people will buy it. We will require new standards for service quality--on-time performance, onboard and station services, cost recovery, connectivity, to name a few. The public is going to know what Amtrak is doing and would be kept apprised of their performance through quarterly reports from the Federal Railroad Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also addresses the problem of train delays. On many routes outside the Northeast, freight trains delay Amtrak riders from reaching their destination on time. It is against the Federal law. As we know in the airline industry, delays frustrate passengers and hurt the company's bottom line. Our bill would authorize the Surface Transportation Board to issue fines to freight railroads that delay Amtrak trains. We all have to share the system and share it efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have suggested another provider could be more efficient than Amtrak. I doubt this claim, but our bill does authorize a program to allow a freight railroad to bid for Amtrak's subsidy on up to two long-distance or State-supported corridor routes. So we are saying, even if there is some skepticism on our part, the bill authorizes the States to go ahead and work with the freight railroad to bid for an Amtrak subsidy, on up to two long-distance or State-supported corridor routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat that because it is very significant. We want the States to participate, and we want to open as much of a change in policy as can be done with practical output. This pilot program could allow freight railroads to maximize efficiencies because they own the tracks already. As many Northeast corridor States have called for more involvement in how that essential corridor is run, this bill will improve governance by giving Northeast States, such as New Jersey, a bigger voice in infrastructure  and operations decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State will join a newly formed commission that will develop recommendations about the short- and long-term capital investments, among other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And speaking of governance, our bill restructures Amtrak's board of directors by ensuring a bipartisan nine-member board of qualified members. That gives an opportunity to bring more people into the management decision process, and we think it will be a much more efficient and involved board. One board member, nominated by President Bush, actually told me at his Senate confirmation hearing that he had never even been on an Amtrak train. Well, it does not suggest he is going to be working with  knowledge in hand that is significant or helpful to the company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently there is a seven-member board, no qualification requirements, and for years the Administration had taken the position that the board need not be bipartisan at all. Well, it was originally structured as a bipartisan board to give all sides to the principal parties to be able to be engaged in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked hard to forge this bipartisan compromise plan. Last Congress, our plan, which was nearly identical to this one, was approved by the Senate as an amendment to the budget bill by a vote of 93 to 6. That tells us this is a well thought-out plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are only slight changes to our bill from the last Congress, and we will have a managers' amendment to address other minor modifications. Our  Nation's passenger rail programs have not been reauthorized for a decade, and the result is chaos in our transportation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this Amtrak bill, to provide millions of Americans with more transportation choices. It is fair to say that the public has agreed with this change in droves. They are sick and tired of being delayed, paying more for fuel, and including a more polluted atmosphere at the same time. It is time to make this change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I send a managers' amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this amendment will strike the title on security which has already become law this year. It adds a study on trip time in the Northeast corridor, and makes several technical corrections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor to my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Lott.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me say with regard to the package that was agreed to, the changes, we did work together on that. It was cleared on both sides. I want to thank the leaders for allowing us to move forward on this legislation. It is never easy to go straight to a bill these days. There are Senators who have reservations about going to this particular bill at this time. Some Senators wanted to make sure they were going to have an opportunity to look at the legislation and prepare thoughtful amendments,  amendments that might, frankly, improve the legislation, add additional reforms, delete parts of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is all well and good. I understand that maybe some Senators were not aware we were going to try to go to Amtrak today, even though I know an effort was made to try to inform both sides that would be the intent after we dealt with the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the Southwick nomination, and the DREAM Act. Maybe it moved a little quicker than people thought because of some of the earlier actions today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to emphasize this too. While I have been involved in working on this legislation for some 3 years with Senator Lautenberg as chairman of this subcommittee and now as ranking member, and I think there are some good things in here worth having, maybe we can even strengthen it more. That would be positive for the future of Amtrak. I am perfectly willing and anxious to see if there are good ideas of how we can make it even a stronger bill. I want Amtrak to succeed. If we are going  to keep it, let's fix it where it will work. I do not think it is wise to continue putting money into a system that is not enough, and then complain because it is not doing the job. We are slowly starving it, using it more, and complaining that it is not doing better. I think we need</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier today, this is not something people in my State are going to feel an immediate impact from. We do have Amtrak service that runs through my State, north and south, from New Orleans to Chicago. We have even had it down along the coast. Probably some people would say: Well, it is not worth it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we need Amtrak. I believe we need a national passenger rail system. It is a part of the package. I support improving aviation and a modernization of the aircraft control system. I want us to have safety in the airways. I want us to have less congestion. I want us to do what we need to do to modernize the system. I want good passenger airline service. I also want to continue to work to improve highways in this country. But I do not believe that lanes and planes will always be enough.  There is a limit to what you can do in the air and on the ground with highways. I think we need passenger rail service also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not something, again, that is going to be critical in my State. But I think it is important for our country. My State will benefit, too, when the rest of the country benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also think if we are going to have this system, it ought to not be just the Northeast corridor. I think we should continue to work to try to find ways to make other routes profitable, on time, provide good service. That is what we are trying to do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my friends look at me and say: Well, why are you trying to do this? This is costing money. It is too overly subsidized. They have union problems, this, that and the other. I admit it has problems. I think we are part of the problem, because we are not engaged in trying to improve the law, give them more power to do what they need to do to make the tough decisions, get outside advice, try to figure  out how to do a better job. That is what we  do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is an area I have worked on for most of my career in Congress, transportation and infrastructure. I believe they are critical to the future of our country. It is about jobs. It is about economic development. It is about opportunity. It is about movement. It is about America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have been involved for some time, to the consternation of some of my friends. We have worked on this before. I worked on the last Amtrak reform legislation. I had higher hopes from that legislation than the results we got. But I think we have made some progress. And when you do legislation that does not achieve all you want it to do, my attitude is, come back and try again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to show you the amount of support we have, when we brought this up on the reconciliation package in 2005, it got 93 votes. Some people said: Well, it is not  enough, or, we can do better. But when they voted, 93 Senators voted for it. That is part of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This time, hopefully, we can get it through here freestanding, get the House to act, let us get to conference, let's bring in the administration. If the administration has recommendations or concerns, great, let us hear them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My problem with the administration is, they have tried to ignore it. So let's try to get them involved. I am not going to be partisan about this. I do not want to blast Amtrak, I don't want to blast the board or the administration. I want us all to get together. That is part of the effort of what we are trying to do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, makes a number of important reforms in Amtrak. It has three major themes: Amtrak reform and accountability; cost cutting; and creating funding options for States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, whether are you from Illinois, California, or Missouri, or whether you are from New Jersey, you ought to like this. And if you are a conservative Republican, did you hear what I said? Cost cutting, reform, and accountability. This is made in heaven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should get this done, and work in good faith with each other. I think we need to increase the executive branch oversight and involvement in Amtrak. The bill ensures that taxpayer money is used more effectively and it builds on the improvements that have been made in recent years. I think you have to give credit to the fact that David Gunn, when he was the president of Amtrak, made some improvements in his management. He did a good job. He finally wound up leaving because he had other  opportunities, and maybe some people were critical of him. But I have to say I think he did a great job, and he moved it in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires Amtrak to develop better financial systems and to evaluate its operations objectively. It forces Amtrak to improve the efficiency of long-distance train service. There are some lines that are losing way too much money. I think the Amtrak officials should look at it and try to make those lines more profitable, put some guidelines on them, put some pressure on them, and if they do not meet them, cut them off. I cannot defend a line that is losing money and is costing $400 a head  subsidy for a passenger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the bill reduces Amtrak's operating subsidy by 40 percent by 2012 by requiring Amtrak to use its funds more effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it does not just say "do it," it provides a number of things that will lead to making that possible. The bill promotes a greater role for the private sector by allowing private companies to bid on operating Amtrak lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also creates a new rail capital grant program that States can use to start new inner city passenger rail service. There has been a real increase, and that is where we had a lot of boardings, a lot of passengers. They are using that service where that opportunity has existed. This would be the first time that States will have a Federal program they can use for passenger rail, putting inner city passenger rail on similar footing with highway transit and airports, all of which have Federal  assistance programs for infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people complain about the money in Amtrak, and yet if you look at what we have in these other areas, highways and transit and airports, Amtrak is terribly shortchanged. We provide all of this infrastructure in these other areas, and then we are not prepared to do that with the passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States will not have to rely only on Amtrak for their inner city passenger rail service. It gives them more opportunity, more for themselves, and to have a Federal program work with them to achieve that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, while discussing reform, we should not forget there is good news here. Some people will only say: Well, it is still losing money. In fiscal year 2007, there was a record number of 25.8 million passengers who traveled on Amtrak. People are using it and using it more. It is the chicken-and-egg deal. Once you get better equipment, on-time service, better food, going to places people want to go, they will ride. In the past they haven't done it because maybe the equipment was old or they got  delayed. As they have provided better service, more people started riding. The boarding ticket revenues increased 11 percent to $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2007. Of course, the Acela Express, I guess the old standard of what Amtrak should do, can do--and we use it here in this corridor--had a 20-percent increase in ridership and achieved an on-time performance of 87.8 percent, proving it can be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passenger service can be on time. The Acela is so popular that another round-trip between New York and Washington was created in July.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not focus solely on the Northeast corridor though. I want to make sure we have some service in the South and the Midwest and the West and in the Northwest. The Capital Corridor operating in California between Auburn and San Jose increased ridership by 15 percent and has an ontime performance of 75 percent. Most notably, the Lincoln service connecting Chicago to St. Louis is up 42 percent. Chicago to St. Louis, that is a tremendous increase. It is a direct result of the State more than  doubling its contract with Amtrak. Across the country, States are interested in passenger service, and passengers are responding in record numbers to the better service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill> is the best mechanism to reform Amtrak. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Read it. It is not a long, complicated bill. But if you have a better idea, come on out here. Let's hear it. Tomorrow we will be ready for business. We will have some amendments. The way I like to do business, with the cooperation of our chairman, if you have an amendment, let's have you offer it. Let's talk about it, and let's vote. Let's don't be setting them aside and piling them up for later on  in the day. Let's do business. I think that is one way you get Senators to actually be here and doing work, actually have some votes. I don't want to go on too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just run down some of the areas where we have concentrated in this bill. It does provide for management improvement. The bill requires a financial accounting system for Amtrak operations and a 5-year financial plan. Why in the world wouldn't they have that? I don't know. Families have plans for their budgets and what they are going to do in the future. Amtrak ought to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It deals with debt. The bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and Amtrak, to negotiate the restructuring of Amtrak's debt within 1 year. This is something Senator Lautenberg has talked about. They can actually save money. Why would they not do that? So we would direct that in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does improve corporate governance. It adds the Amtrak president to the Amtrak board, bringing the total number of members of the board to nine. Think about that, the Amtrak president was not on the board. That doesn't make any sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It calls for metrics and standards. In consultation with the Surface Transportation Board and the operating freight railroads, the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak shall jointly develop metrics and standards for measuring the performance and service quality of intercity train operations. They should include cost recovery, ontime performance, ridership per train mile, onboard and station services, the whole package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does improve the route methodology. It would provide access to Amtrak equipment and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States wishing to use operators other than Amtrak would be able to do so  under this legislation. It would improve the Northeast corridor. It would work to improve the long distance routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have touched on the very important areas, but the one I think that is going to make the greatest difference is the State Capital Grant Program for intercity passenger rail. When I have talked to Governors and transportation officials, railroad people, they say this is what we need. This could really make a difference. I see the Presiding Officer nodding her head. I suspect her State is one that would have an interest up there in the northwest corner of Washington and Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there are significant reforms. This is a good effort. This is the kind of work we ought to do more of in the Senate. We have managed for the last few years to find what we could disagree about, something we could fight about. We haven't taken the time to take up issues that affect real people's lives that we can agree on, that are bipartisan. I appreciate the leader putting this in the agenda. He did it at the request of a number of Senators who care about this. Senator Carper obviously  is one of them, Senator Lautenberg, myself, and others. We have been pleading with them. I pleaded with the previous majority leader. Let's get this bill up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people say there are other things more important we could be doing. Why aren't you doing something about health care, more appropriations bills? That is a good question. All I know is, this is an issue that matters. We don't know when we are going to have another incident in America with aviation, or somewhere else, when we need trains. We need good service. I am also working in the Finance Committee to see if we can't get a tax credit so that we can continue to improve the capacity of our  freight rail and allow them to build off ramps so the freight trains can get out of the way so Amtrak can run without losing time and money. We are looking at that side of the equation too. I know some of our friends in the freight rail industry are not all that excited about this legislation because</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't go on any longer. I would like for us to get to some amendments that may be available on Amtrak. I know Senator Sununu has some. We will continue tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, once again, it is obvious to all that Senator Lott understands what we have to do to get things done around here, and that it can't be all one way because each of us does represent a different State. We are brought here to bring in the opinions of the people whom we serve, our constituents, so we do get a mix of views. Sometimes I wish we didn't, but for the most part that is life in the real world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing we sometimes fail to see is, when we do something for the infrastructure, when we do something for rail service, it is in the national interest, even though there are currently many more riders in the very densely populated Northeast corridor. The fact is, as I related before, other places around the country are examining rail service as an alternative to their own congestion and pollution problems. When we look at something called essential air service, it is essential. That is why  it is done. The Government does subsidize its existence because communities need that. So it is with rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly enough, only four States have no contact with Amtrak. One of them is Hawaii, which involves a very long train ride. The other is Alaska. We have heard Senator Stevens talk about having a railroad that goes to Alaska. But otherwise we have 46 States that have contact with Amtrak. Some of them are more active than others. But as was said by our colleague, Senator Lott, some of these States don't have the traffic or they are not en route enough. The mission is to  get as many States involved with Amtrak, with rail service as we can, national rail passenger service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look at ways of improving the management of Amtrak, that which we would with any business. I spent much of my life in business before I came to the Senate. Businesses run differently than government. But there are some principles that are the same; for instance, investments in product. If you don't put the money in, you don't get the money out. What we found here is, since the creation of Amtrak, which goes back to 1971--1971 was the creation of the Amtrak quasi-government corporation. It  had been in private hands under different names for many years and never succeeded. Why? The thing that is obvious; that is, with rail passenger rail service, there is going to always be some assistance required from government, just as there is for the aviation system and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Germany, there was a program to establish a rail system that cost about $70 billion in a 10-year period. China now is establishing a passenger rail service which could cost up to $200 billion. And here we are in the most powerful nation in the world playing catchup. We are not talking about insignificant sums of money, but we are talking about substantial opportunities for us to improve what we are doing with this bill that will run almost $2 billion a year for 6 years, plus some additional  funding in another bill raised by bonding authority. Senator Lott has been very helpful in the Finance Committee to get this system up to where it ought to be. Whenever we look for opportunities to improve life in America, certainly this looms high on the horizon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made it clear that we are ready to accept amendments. We would like them brought to the floor this evening or tomorrow. But we will not be able to stay here and not see any response, if there isn't enough interest by fellow Members to come down and bring us their amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the previously agreed to committee amendments be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendments; that the pending managers' amendment be considered and agreed to and considered as original text for the purpose of further amendments; that the bill, as amended, be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendments; that no points of order be considered waived by virtue of this agreement.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, we are moving on into the early hours of the evening, and I appreciate the work that the bill managers, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott, have done on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a member of the Commerce Committee as well, and there is no question that there was strong support for this legislation when we voted on it last year. As Senator Lautenberg indicated, it was a 93-to-6 vote. I am sorry to say, at least from his perspective, I was one of the six who voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the work that has gone into this legislation, I do think it has some real weaknesses. Both Senators LOTT and LAUTENBERG touched on some of those weaknesses in their opening remarks--that at times Amtrak has not delivered the kind of quality service we would expect; at times they have not delivered, year after year, the kind of financial results we would hope for and  expect as taxpayers who are providing the subsidies and the support  for Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its creation well over 25 years ago, the Federal subsidies have amounted to over $20 billion. Amtrak was originally created with the intention of becoming self-sufficient. There was an Amtrak reform bill passed in 1997, recommitting to this goal, and yet it still has not happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a taxpayer and as a Senator, it causes me great concern we have not done better--better both in terms of performance on the service and the quality side--but also on the financial side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was discussion of the Northeast Corridor. The Northeast Corridor does provide for a great opportunity to serve millions of people running from my State of New Hampshire all the way down to Washington, DC, and beyond--some of the more densely populated areas where it makes the most sense to have a train service. But even in the Northeast Corridor, the operation is not what we would want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is fair to expect more; not just in the financial oversight that is in the legislation, not just in some of the new programs that are in the legislation, but, for example, in the long-distance train service. For the long-distance train routes--I think there are 15 or 16 now--they lose $200 per passenger. That is not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a couple amendments I will be offering. One deals with that huge per-passenger subsidy, to say if we are losing $200 per passenger--every single passenger: a $200 subsidy--on some of those long-distance routes, we should not continue to operate that route.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some proposals for allowing route competition. I think that is also a good idea, but one we can build on and expand on, allowing more and different routes to be offered on a competitive basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think there are ways to improve the bill that we need to take a look at, and that I hope are at least part of the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not necessarily expect to win on all of those amendments, but I think it is important we be realistic about some of the weaknesses that are in the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to address an issue that was spoken about early this evening by Senator Alexander. He discussed at some length the Internet tax moratorium and what that would mean to American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, we have a ban on Internet access taxes. You cannot levy an access tax on the Internet for consumers, or for businesses, for that matter. Everyone talks about the importance of broadband to our economy. Without question, the Internet is important to our economy, not just because it gives us information or brings data into our homes, but because it represents a national--in effect, a global--network for communication and for commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is something that is the responsibility of Congress to protect--to protect from onerous regulation, to protect from taxes that would discourage long-term investment that would raise costs for consumers or businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had that ban on Internet taxes in place, and I think it is important we make that tax ban permanent. Unfortunately, after introducing legislation at the beginning of this year, we have not had a single vote on this issue. We have not voted on it in the Commerce Committee or any subcommittee. They have not voted on it in the Finance Committee. We have not had a vote on it on this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us have been trying very hard to get a vote to make this Internet tax moratorium permanent. The moratorium expires on Halloween, of all days. On that day, because the ban will no longer be in effect, States, cities, towns, and counties would be in the position to levy new taxes on Internet access. That is not right. It is not good for consumers. It is not good for the economy. It is not good for the communication system, the data system, and the commerce system we have come to count on  with the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of Senators--Senator Wyden; Senator McCain; Senator McConnell; Senator Lott and numerous House Members, such as ANNA ESHOO from California--have worked very hard on making this ban permanent. For those who have listened to this debate from around the country, I am sure they wonder why it is we cannot do anything in a consistent way. We have research and development tax credits that lasts only for a year. We have a death tax that is repealed  in 2011 and comes back from the dead in 2012. And we have a ban on Internet access taxes that only lasts 4 years. It ought to be made permanent for the sake of consistency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I do not want to cause any unnecessary delay in underlying legislation, I think that addressing the Internet tax moratorium is something that is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that reason, Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk at this time and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this legislation would simply take what has already been done in the House--which is to pass a 4-year extension--and to make it permanent. A lot of good work was done in the House to strengthen the current moratorium and ban on Internet access taxes. Unfortunately, despite the fact there were over 240 Democrats and Republicans who supported this legislation, it did not receive an up-or-down vote to make the ban on Internet taxes permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we do is take the House language in this amendment and make it permanent. It provides clarification with regard to services and technologies that are dealt with and not dealt with. If you are an Internet business, you still pay property taxes and payroll taxes. You pay business income taxes. But the Government should not be allowed to levy a tax on access to the Internet for the consumers themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are certain States that are affected by grandfather clauses that were included in the House language. We maintain that language. All we do is fully extend it permanently so that if you are a consumer you know the Internet will not be taxed. If you are a small business, you know your cost of Internet access will not go up. If you are doing business over the Internet, you know there will continue to be investments in the infrastructure necessary to increase broadband deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think at the very least we should have an opportunity to vote on making this Internet tax moratorium permanent. I think it is a commonsense approach. We can always come back and look at the technical issues associated with the language if it needs to be modified in 5 years or 10 years or 15 years. That is what Congress does. But we should say, once and for all, we are not going to tax Internet access at the Federal level, at the State level, at the local level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank you for the consideration and yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for offering this important amendment. We are running out of time. The Internet tax moratorium does expire in a week. As the Senator from New Hampshire has indicated, State and local governments across our country could impose taxes on Internet access as soon as a week from now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important we address this issue--not that the underlying measure is not important as well. I know it is important to many Senators. But the Internet needs to be protected. Here is our chance to go on record: Are we for a tax on Internet access or not?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internet has been at the heart of America's economic growth over the past decade--all because Government has not gotten in the way. Those days are over if we open the Internet to new taxes. I think there is bipartisan support for a permanent ban, for continuing the moratorium forever, and I think the Senate ought to have an opportunity to go on record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only way, Madam President, in the parliamentary situation we find ourselves in, that a vote on a permanent moratorium could be achieved is if I were to offer a motion to invoke cloture, which I send to the desk now, on the Sununu amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending amendment No. 3452 to make the moratorium on Internet access taxes and multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce permanent.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Hampshire.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Republican leader for his remarks and for the support he has provided to us. He is not a member of the Commerce Committee. He has a lot of other duties in the Senate, but he has taken a great interest in this issue, as I think most any legislator would, because the Internet is something we all understand, we deal with, we work with at one level or another. Our families, our friends, our neighbors, and businesses we may have worked for before, depend on  it in different ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone understands when you tax something, you raise its cost; when you tax something, you end up getting less of it--especially in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people stood up and said: Well, there are some States that have some taxes on the Internet, but there has still been broadband deployment in their State. That may well be, but you  cannot argue with the economic fact that when you tax something, you raise its cost; and when you raise its cost, you create a barrier to investment. Those are economic facts of life we cannot change, and those are the economic factors that make implementing a permanent  ban on Internet taxes so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of making this ban permanent have also suggested it is an unfunded mandate to tell States they cannot tax the Internet, that it is an unfunded mandate because if we allow them to tax, they could raise money, but because we are telling them they cannot tax Internet access, they cannot raise that money, so there is a cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is classic Washington-speak, a classic inside-the-beltway mentality, that if we prevent a State from imposing taxes, we have to compensate the State for that. That is plain wrong. If that were true, then we should be compensating every State in the Union because we do not allow them to arbitrarily impose taxes, fees, and tolls on every mile of interstate highway in the country, or because we do not allow every State in the Union to impose unique taxes on any flight or aviation that  comes into or leaves their State. We do not allow that because we recognize our aviation system is a national system, because we recognize our interstate highway system is a national system. We do not allow States to tax exports for the same reason. And yet, we do not call those examples unfunded mandates. We do not</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second objection that some have made is they recognize: Well, the technologies may change, so defining what is Internet access or data service or voice service--those definitions may have to be modified, as we have modified them over the last 6 or 8 years since the first ban on Internet access taxes was first put in place in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if the fact that technology may change is a reason for not legislating or not making something permanent, we could use that as an excuse not to do anything ever or at least to do every bill on a 1- or 2-year basis. Especially in an area where we are dealing with investment and taxation, it is counterproductive at times to do such short-term legislation because those in the economy who are taking risks, making investments, creating jobs and economic opportunity for other people, will not be  able to calculate and estimate what long-term returns and benefits might come from a given investment. They do not know what the tax rate will be or they do not know what the regulatory burden will be. As a result, you get fewer investments in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we know that technology, services, and the approach to the Internet that businesses take may change in the future, but Congress can always and should always revisit laws, rules, or regulations, whether it has to do with Internet access or any other area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a piece of legislation whose time has come. I hope we can get expeditious consideration and approval because I think this is something that has been shown to have bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I would like to turn my attention to another amendment I mentioned earlier in my remarks, and that has to do with the long-distance train routes. As I said, I think there are 14, 15, or 16 routes in operation now. None of these long-distance train routes make any money. They do not make any operating profit. They all lose money. They all lose money at different levels. Some of the long-distance routes, by GAO accounting estimates, lose as much as $200 per passenger. That means there  is a Federal taxpayer subsidy, not of $1, or $10, or $20, or $40, but $200 for every passenger riding that route over the course of a year. That is a level of cost and subsidy which just can't be justified; especially at a time when we are trying to deal with difficult Federal priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today and throughout this week, there has been a lot of discussion about SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and the fact that SCHIP is an important program. I agree. I supported the legislation here in the Senate. Its goal is to provide coverage for lower income families who aren't covered by Medicaid, but may not be covered at their place of employment by a health care policy. As we are having a debate about providing that funding and targeting it to the most needy, whether  it is health care or any other high-priority initiative, it is so hard to justify running trains across the country that have a subsidy of $200 for every passenger riding that train through the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what I would propose is that we set a standard of $200. If your per-passenger subsidy through the course of a year is less than $200, we will allow the train to operate. Now, we hope it improves. We hope the reforms that were described at the beginning of the evening work--improve the management, reduce the costs, improve the efficiency, and improve the performance. But if they do not, and that subsidy level remains above $200 over the course of a year, that route should not remain in operation.  Then, in subsequent years, we bring that threshold down, and the second year after this amendment would be in effect, the threshold would be $175. So if you have to subsidize passengers at $170 for every passenger who rides that train in a year, you can remain in operation, but if it is more than</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank you for the time. The amendment I  have just submitted is as I have described, and I hope this is an idea and an approach which can be incorporated into the legislation. I think it is common sense. I know a lot of Members of the Senate believe strongly that we should have long-distance trains, with long routes across the country. I would like to see those routes maintained and sustained as well, if it can be done in  an economically reasonable way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the last years have shown that for some of these routes, the passenger levels are so low, the costs of operating are so high, they just can't compete. They can't compete with buses, they can't compete with automobiles, and they can't compete with airplanes in terms of cost and efficiency. So I think a step like this is long overdue. Again, I thank the bill managers, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott, for their time and consideration and for allowing me to offer these amendments  this evening.</paragraph>

  <chair>2007 FARM BILL</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate seeing the Senator from Pennsylvania in the chair. We were both in the Agriculture Committee today. I thank him for his leadership for dairy farmers and for nutrition and feeding kids and all that he did that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 farm bill is a chance for Congress to make historic strides in agriculture, alternative energy, and to literally help improve the lives of millions of families across the country--families struggling from Harrisburg to Erie, from Ashtabula to Gallipolis, from Lima to Toledo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a State such as Ohio, with a long and rich agricultural history, this means a bright future for our agriculture industry, for our family farmers, and for our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the leadership of Senator Harkin. I am proud, as Ohio's first Senator to sit on the Agriculture Committee in four decades, to be part of this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill could mean that low-income families will have more access to better nutrition by increasing Food Stamp Programs and access to affordable healthy foods. That means more fruits and vegetables into the schools in Hamilton, Middletown, and Akron, and more fruits and vegetables available, grown by local farmers, to go into farmers markets in Columbus and Zanesville and all over our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, as the occupant of the chair and I and others gathered in the committee, we heard from Rhonda Stewart of Hamilton, OH. Rhonda is perhaps in her early thirties and has, I believe, a 9-year-old son. She is a single mother, struggling and working full-time and making about $8, $9, or $10 an hour, with no health insurance. She was president of the local PTA and her son is involved in the Cub Scouts and she is a food stamp beneficiary. She struggled every month. At the beginning  of the month, she told the committee back in February, she would serve her son pork chops that first week, which is his favorite meal. By the middle of the month, they went to McDonald's or another fast-food place maybe twice. But by the end of the month, as times got tough and she struggled</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the farm bill, we are helping people like her and her family who work hard and play by the rules and do everything in the workplace and in their homes that we ask them to do as citizen of their communities and our country. This bill could mean new investment and a new direction for farmers in Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 farm bill reflects the values of farmers across Ohio: forward-thinking, responsible, and working to protect our natural resources and our rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help family farmers in my State and in Pennsylvania and across the country by strengthening the farm safety net, one that will provide better protection for farmers against disasters, such as either low yield or low prices. Either one can be obviously devastating to farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Average Crop Revenue Program, which Senator Durbin and I introduced a bill to create as part of the farm bill--amended by Chairman Harkin into the farm bill--offers a much needed choice to farmers. It represents significant reform for farmers and huge savings--literally $3.5 billion--for taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Farmers can stay in the current or old program that does little to protect against drops in revenue or, for the first time ever, farmers will be able to switch to a forward-looking policy that better protects against volatile crop prices, natural disasters, and rising production costs. If farmers are doing well and prices and yields are good, farmers would not get tax dollars. If times are bad--the yield is low or there are floods or tornadoes that cause major crop yield drops or if the price  is low--then the farmer will get help. That is the way that agriculture should be. That is the way most farmers I find in northwest Ohio and all over my State want to do it too. I traveled throughout Ohio this Spring--to Chillicothe, where we did roundtables with fruit and vegetable farmers, and in Montgomery</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met with a corn farmer in Henry County who will be supplying corn to one of the first ethanol plants in Ohio. I met with a hog farmer in Montgomery County who uses wind turbines to provide on-farm energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This farm bill makes a commitment to move beyond antiquated energy sources and wean ourselves from Middle Eastern oil and prepare American agriculture to lead the world in renewable energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the right resources and the right incentives, farmers can help decrease our dependence on foreign oil and produce clean, sustainable, renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a State such as Ohio, with a talented labor force and a proud lead-the-nation manufacturing history, that doesn't just mean stronger farms and more prosperous farmers; it means a stronger economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rural communities across the Nation will benefit from additional Federal assistance in the farm bill and small towns not far from where I grew up in Lexington, OH, places like Butler and Belleville, will benefit from funding for infrastructure and hospitals, while expanding access to broadband for all of my State, especially southeast Ohio, which doesn't have the access it needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will also provide more than $4 billion in additional funding for conservation programs to help farmers protect our water quality, expand wildlife habitat, and preserve endangered farmland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am pleased with the bill overall, it can be improved. The public is perfectly willing to help family farmers when they need it, but taxpayers will not support massive payments to farms that have substantial net incomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not be sending tax dollars to Florida real estate developers, to city farmers who live in New York, to NBA players, or to media personalities. Those are not the people who should benefit from the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret that we have not funded the McGovern-Dole international feeding program. I hope as this legislation progresses, we will do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agricultural industry in Ohio has experienced unprecedented change in recent years, but the values of Ohio farmers--hard work, stewardship of the  land, caring for their families--remains steadfast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, too, must be steadfast in our support for farmers, but we must also change how we go about providing that support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the proposal put before us in the Agriculture Committee today. I hope we can even improve upon it in the weeks ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
