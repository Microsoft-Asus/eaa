  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF FRANKLIN D. BARCA -- (Senate - May 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3690">S3690</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to Franklin D. Barca, a loyal member of my staff who has chosen to retire after being a public servant to our country for more than four decades. A graduate of Braintree High School in Braintree, MA, and Northeastern University, Frank served a full career as a civilian within the Department of Defense at locations such as the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the Pentagon. To my good fortune,  Frank was assigned to my office as a detailee in 1997 and later agreed to join my staff as my military legislative assistant, a position he has dutifully held ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Serving as my adviser on national security issues, Frank's greatest legacy will be his work as the clerk of the caucus created to save the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard during the 2005 round of base realignment and closure. His tireless work ethic, attention to detail, and leadership were instrumental in our efforts to show the Department of Defense that Portsmouth truly is the gold standard of the Navy. During his work on BRAC, Frank was affectionately given the nickname of "The General."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walking through the Capitol with Frank you understand his love and respect for history. Whether it's showing someone Lincoln's catafalque for the first time or telling stories of the District during the Civil War, Frank  seems to have a bit of trivia for every corner of this building. In the words of another man whom the states of New Hampshire and Massachusetts lay claim, Daniel Webster, "The dignity of history consists in reciting events with truth  and accuracy, and in presenting human agents and their actions in an interesting and instructive form. The first element in history, therefore, is truthfulness; and this truthfulness must be displayed in a concrete form." I will certainly miss Frank's advice, straightforwardness, and willingness to go the extra mile to help me serve the people of New Hampshire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that Frank Barca will enjoy his retirement. It is an achievement that he certainly has earned. I know that Frank will get pleasure from being able to spend more time with his wife Elaine, his daughters, and his four grandchildren Katie, Meredith, Michael, and Sarah.</paragraph>
