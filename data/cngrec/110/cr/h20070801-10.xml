    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Providing Resources Early for Kids Act of 2007, the PRE-K Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRE-K Act will help more children enter school ready to succeed. It creates a new Federal/State partnership to provide better preschool opportunities for our country's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research shows that participation in a high-quality early education program can improve success in school and later in life. So this bill focuses on quality. It is flexible enough to encompass many types of State-funded preschool programs so long as they are high quality. For example, in Hawaii, an Early Learning Task Force is working on a new State-funded preschool program to ensure Hawaii's children have access to a variety of high-quality preschool experiences, from Head Start to community  based organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRE-K Act is one of the best investments we can make in our children, our families, and our Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its passage.</paragraph>
