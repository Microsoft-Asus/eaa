  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE WAILUKU COURTHOUSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this month, the county of Maui celebrated the centennial anniversary of the historic Wailuku Courthouse. Built in 1907, the Wailuku Courthouse served as  the center of the judicial system on Maui for more than 80 years. Today, it is home to Maui County's Department of the Prosecuting Attorney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Hawaiian Organic Act, passed by Congress in 1900, created a system of governance for the new Territory of Hawaii. County governments were established along with a territorial court system. The town of Wailuku was selected as the seat of Maui's county government, making it the logical place to construct a new courthouse and other public buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contract to build the Wailuku Courthouse, at the cost of $23,312.40, was awarded to Angus P. McDonald in September 1907. Construction began the next month and was completed a year later. In 1909, the Honorable Judge Aluwae Noa Kepoikai became the first judge to preside over cases presented in the new Wailuku Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Hawaii and the county of Maui grew, so did the demand for legal services and the needs of the judiciary. In 1988, the State judicial system on Maui moved into a new building, and in 1991, plans were made to gut the courthouse. However, the county of Maui intervened and took control of the courthouse by way of a land swap with the State, saving the historic building and its interior. A $1.8 million restoration followed, and in 1993, Maui's Department of the Prosecuting Attorney moved into the  newly renovated courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The historic courthouse has served the people of Maui for 100 years. The fact that it remains as both a working government building and as an architectural treasure of Hawaii's past is the result of the efforts of the many people who are to be commended and honored as we celebrate the centennial of the Wailuku Courthouse.</paragraph>
