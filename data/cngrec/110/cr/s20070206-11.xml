  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>The issue before the American people that relates to Iraq is the surge--the escalation of the war in Iraq. That is the debate that should be before this body, and last night that was prevented. An up-or-down vote on McCain, who is supporting the surge, or a vote in opposition to the surge, the escalation sponsored by Warner and Levin--that is the issue before this body today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a diversion. This is a diversion. We finished the Super Bowl. This is a trick play by the Republicans. The real issue before this body is surge or no surge, escalation or no escalation. That is the debate the American people deserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard what the distinguished majority leader said. I agree with him. The Senate, as I have often said, should be the conscience of the Nation. There are only 100 of us to represent 300 million people. Americans expect us to speak up on the war. Americans expect us to vote on the war. Americans expect us to vote on the issue of the surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I understand some Senators will support the surge, some will oppose it, but allow us to have those votes. Allow us to express the conscience of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a column by E.J. Dionne entitled "The War To Save The Surge" from today's Washington Post be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
