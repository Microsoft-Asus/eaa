  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment pending on the floor, the second look at wasteful spending amendment, otherwise known as the Gregg amendment, after the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. The truth is, we might call this really the Daschle amendment or the Byrd amendment or the Levin amendment or Murray or Dodd, other Senators who have supported virtually this same proposal on previous occasions. I will explain that more in just a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look at this amendment, compared with one offered by the former majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, when the Democrats were, again, in leadership, we can see how the Gregg amendment corresponds virtually, precisely with the proposal made by then-Democratic majority leader Tom Daschle. It established a fast-track congressional process for consideration of Presidential rescissions. It required congressional affirmation of rescissions. It allowed the President to suspend funds for a maximum  of 45 days. It does not permit the President to resubmit rescissions once rejected by the Congress. It allowed rescissions of discretionary funding and targeted tax benefits. It did not allow rescissions of new mandatory programs. That is one area where this differs from the Daschle amendment. The Gregg amendment would permit rescission of new mandatory spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I interject, if we are going to get a handle on runaway Federal spending, it is not going to be in discretionary spending alone. We have actually--contrary, perhaps, to popular perception--done a pretty good job limiting nondefense, nonhomeland security discretionary spending. But to paraphrase, that is not where the money is. Where the money is actually in mandatory spending--in entitlement spending, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Gregg amendment quite appropriately addresses rescission of new, not existing, new mandatory spending programs. We can see here that in virtually every respect except two--the one I just mentioned and that only four rescission packages would be permitted annually under the Gregg amendment--there is virtual identity between these two amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is this so important? I have to tell my colleagues that as I travel around my State of Texas, there are issues people talk to me about, as with other Members. They are concerned about our lack of border security. They are concerned, obviously, about the war on terror and the way forward in Iraq. But one of the really top three issues that my constituents talk to me about is Federal spending. They worry about the deficit. They worry about the long-term obligation under Social Security and  Medicare, a bill that is going to be paid by our children and grandchildren, about the morality of basically putting this burden on their backs in the future. So what this amendment does, this second look at wasteful spending, it allows us to cut out some of the pork, cut out some of the waste in a way that I think responds to this very realistic concern by the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You will note that in 1995, when Senator Daschle offered this amendment, this was, of course, during the Clinton administration--I want to note that--we had 21 Democratic Senators--virtually all of whom, I guess, are still in the Senate--who supported that Daschle amendment. My hope is they would vote for cloture so we can have an up-or-down vote on this Gregg amendment, which, as I showed a moment ago, is virtually identical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at some of the quotes back then by distinguished Members of the Senate in support of the Daschle amendment. My hope would be that Senators would remember, perhaps have their recollection refreshed by this exercise in a way that would encourage them to have at least an open mind and possibly even embrace the Gregg amendment today as they did the Daschle amendment back in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Byrd, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, someone who respects congressional prerogative and understands the separation of powers perhaps better than anybody else in this body, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no problem with giving the President another opportunity to select from appropriations bills certain items which he feels for his political or for whatever reasons, I have no problem with his sending them to the two Houses and our giving him a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was on March 22, 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is this comment by Senator Feinstein, the distinguished Senator from California. She said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Really, what a line-item veto is all about is deterrence, and that deterrence is aimed at the porkbarrel. I sincerely believe that a line-item veto will work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are talking about, this so-called rescission provision, is in essence a version of the line-item veto, something Presidents have called for in  the past on both sides of the aisle and something I believe, obviously, there has existed bipartisan support for in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is Senator Dorgan, who has said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fully 43 Governors have the line-item veto, which suggests to me that it is a power that the President can safely wield ..... That is why I voted for it, and why I am pleased it is now the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was back on April 25, 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we know what happened to the line-item veto. It ultimately was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. That is why we have had to come back with this modification of this rescission package in order to address the Court's concerns and to ensure its constitutionality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator JOE BIDEN, who said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have long supported an experiment with the line-item veto power for the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Senator Biden on March 27, 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is Senator Dodd who has said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the substitute offered by Senator Daschle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the Daschle amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is a reasonable line-item veto alternative. It requires both Houses of Congress to vote on a President's rescission list and sets up a fast-track procedure to ensure that a vote occurs in a prompt and timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are just a couple of more. Mr. Feingold, the Senator from Wisconsin, said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The line-item veto is about getting rid of those items after the President has them on his desk. I think this will prove to be a useful tool in eliminating some of the things that have happened in Congress that have been held up to public ridicule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That obviously goes with the pork spending, the embarrassing earmarks that we have heard so much about from our constituents, particularly leading up to this last election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Murray said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to give the President the ability to line-item veto all those portions of the appropriations bills that have not been through the hearing and authorization process. All those pork items contribute to our deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have one more from Senator Dorgan, but we have already heard from him. There is one last one from Mr. Levin, the distinguished Senator from Michigan. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That so-called expedited rescission process, it seems to me, is constitutional and is something which we can in good conscience, at least I in good conscience, support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is obvious, perhaps, but let me, at the risk of beating a dead horse, say it again. If this was good policy back in 1995 and 1996, what has changed in 2007? I submit the only thing that has changed is that our deficit has increased for many years, part of which is porkbarrel spending which can be eliminated with the kind of cooperation that this particular amendment would allow. I suggest to our Democratic colleagues--in the spirit of bipartisanship in which we have started this new  Congress with the overwhelming bipartisan passage of an ethics and lobby reform bill and consideration of this minimum wage bill with appropriate relief for small businesses when it comes to regulations and tax relief that will attenuate some of the blow--this is an appropriate amendment for us to consider and pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the spirit of bipartisanship does not end so early on in this session of the Senate. I know there are many cynics who believe it will die an early death. I am not one of them. I remain hopeful and optimistic that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will embrace this opportunity to do the right thing for the people of this great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Georgia is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time is remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Ten minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, I commend the Senator from Texas on his remarks. I commend Senator Judd Gregg on the submission of this amendment. I commend Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, for his insistence on bringing this amendment to the floor of the Senate early. It had been my preference that it be debated during the lobbying reform and ethics bill, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, which we debated last week because the remarks I am going to make tell you how much I think the  enhanced rescission and a second look at wasteful spending is so important to end, curb, and finally do away with what has been an abuse in this body for a long time, and that is the abuse of earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I want to tell a story. When I first came to the Congress of the United States in 1999, the first budget that I voted on and was passed was a voluminous, huge budget--appropriations bill. It had spending in thousands of different categories, many of which I never even looked at, A, because I was not on the committee that had jurisdiction or, B, because so much of it went into last-minute negotiations in the conference committee on the appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget a telephone call I got at 8 o'clock in the morning from a reporter, shortly after--about 2 weeks after the passage of an Omnibus appropriations bill. A newspaper reporter called and said to me:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman, why did you vote for a $50,000 appropriation for a tatoo removal parlor in California?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't vote for any such a thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reporter said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, you did. Didn't you vote for the Omnibus budget?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, I did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reporter said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it was right there in clear view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it wasn't in clear view to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it turned out, after going through that embarrassing experience, which all of us in this business go through from time to time, I started digging around trying to find the $50,000 appropriation for a tatoo removal parlor in California. Finally, I found it. It went into the budget on the appropriations bill on the last night of negotiations. It was on something like page 1186, line 33, in small print. The appropriations act we voted on was put on our desk about 8 hours before we voted on  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not a fast reader anyway, but I couldn't read 1,100 pages in 8 hours. I would go blind. And the fact is, Congress was embarrassed, the Representative who put it in there was very embarrassed, but this Representative was very embarrassed. So I introduced legislation the next year to basically put an end to the last-minute earmark that said the earmark had to be in bold type, large fonts, and on the front page of each appropriations act, and had to lay on the desk for 24 hours to at least  give us a chance to look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Senator Gregg has proposed today is the opportunity for us to not only get a second look, but in the case of a lot of these earmarks a first look, at wasteful appropriations. That is why I thought it should have gone on the previous bill we debated last week, the lobbying reform and ethics bill for, you see, if a President of the United States had gotten that omnibus budget and had the right of rescission, that President could have said: I think we ought to strike the $50,000 for  a tatoo removal parlor in California. And under the Gregg proposal, it would come back to the Senate and the House, and we would have to affirm that. I do not think there is a single person in either party, including the author of that earmark 9 years ago, who would not have voted to affirm the President's rescission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The light of day, sunshine, the power of knowledge, facts are stubborn things. But so often in the appropriations process facts get obliterated or not seen. Appropriations get written in late at night in negotiations between conferees, and we end up with wasteful spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an outstanding proposal by Senator Gregg. As Senator Cornyn has said, and others who have spoken today have said, it actually reflects what has been approved by Members of both parties in this Senate before. But it makes good, common, horse sense and passes the constitutional test, which is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President gets four times a year to send rescissions to the Congress. The Congress has to fast-track its response within 8 days. The Congress has to affirm the rescission, which is the  key point in the balance of power between each of the bodies of Government that are so important to our Constitution. It does not give a President unilateral authority, but it forces the light of day on a Presidential decision for us to take a second look at what was  probably a mistake that this body might have made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I have had some experience with this process. I had the privilege of representing the great State of Georgia for 17 years in its statehouse, in its State senate. At the time I was in the minority, and the Democratic Party in Georgia was in the majority. A dear friend of mine, a fellow against whom I ran for Governor of Georgia in 1990, and who came to this Senate, Zell Miller, and whom I later replaced in this Senate, a great Georgian--I watched him use the line-item veto, which is legal  in Georgia, to cause accountability on the part of legislators, to let the light of day shine on appropriations and, most importantly, to see to it that Georgia was run in a fiscally sound way and we didn't get away with things that we should not have gotten away with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it is good enough for the States, it is good enough for the Federal Government. If it passes the constitutional test of the division of power in our Government--legislative, executive, judicial--it ought to be a part of the body of law, and this proposal does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most important of all, although all the promotion pieces I have read call this a second look at the budget process, in many cases because of the volume it gives us, as individuals, a first look at a mistake we made. Instead of current law, where once that mistake is made it is there, under this right of recision we have a second chance at what was a first impression, and we can make the right decision and do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The money, when it is struck, goes where it ought to go--to deficit reduction. This country has a serious deficit problem, and it has had a serious spending problem. Enhanced rescission places the responsibility on the President to delineate a mistake and forces us to affirm if that, in fact, was a mistake, and the benefit from that savings goes to reduce the deficit, which is the mortgage on our children's future and the future of our grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted to come to the floor today as a cosponsor of the enhanced rescissions amendment proposed by Senator Gregg to speak in its favor, and I encourage every Member of the Senate to take a second look at this proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes sense. It is constitutional. It is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
