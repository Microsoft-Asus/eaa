    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the year, gas prices across the Nation have been increasing. With the summer driving season fast approaching, prices at the pump are again reaching record highs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the price quickly approaching $4 a gallon, it is time again for Congress to act to help consumers with this increased cost. High gas prices not only increase the cost of living for American families, but increased gas prices will affect the prices on nearly every single consumer good on the market. Working families are not only paying more at the pump, but at the grocery store, the pharmacy and the shopping malls as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These increases have a harmful effect on our Nation's economy and security. They make it harder for working families to commute to and from work, especially in cases where public transportation is lacking. It also increases the cost for public transportation, which makes it harder for those individuals without automobiles to travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we see the effects of high prices across the board. Parcel delivery rates increase. Municipalities must increase their taxes to pay for gas for their emergency responder vehicles. Our utilities go up. We cannot afford to stand by idly as our cost of living steadily increases for the sake of continued record oil company profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the rising gas prices, I have requested that the Federal Trade Commission investigate possible gasoline price gouging and hold those accountable who engage in such practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also a cosponsor of Congressman Stupak's legislation, <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>, the Federal Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act. This much needed legislation calls on the FTC and the Attorney General to investigate possible price gouging, both nationally and locally, and to prosecute any group found to be taking advantage of the American people. As summer approaches, travel within the United States historically does increase. According to the Automobile Association of America, gasoline prices may  reach an all-time high by Memorial Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come for Congress and the President to work together on a solution for the American people. Earlier this year the House passed legislation to repeal tax breaks for oil companies while devoting more Federal resources to renewable fuels. I am hopeful the Senate will quickly act on this much needed legislation this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are serious about reducing our dependency on foreign oil, we must work with manufacturers and researchers to bring renewable fuels to the forefront. Our environment and economy depend on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure American consumers are given a voice about the high price of gasoline.</paragraph>
