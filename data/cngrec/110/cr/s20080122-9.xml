    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the public service contributions of Diane Wolf. I also wish to join in cosponsoring the Senate resolution expressing condolences to the family of Ms. Wolf upon her unexpected passing. Diane Wolf was a unique and remarkable individual. Diane Wolf was very inspired by our democratic institutions and, with an abundance of energy and goodwill, she inspired others to share her appreciation for the blessings of our liberties and the institutions that  protect them. She was an enthusiastic student of the form and process of our representative democracy and she greatly admired the structures that house our government, especially the "Shrine of Democracy"--the U.S. Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was her appreciation of the art, architecture, and history of the Capitol that initially brought Ms. Wolf to my attention. At that time, Ms. Wolf served as a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Art, which oversees the design of U.S. coins. During my second tenure as majority leader of the Senate in 1988, I sponsored and achieved passage of a bill establishing the Capitol Preservation Commission and a bill authorizing the Congressional Bicentennial Coin Program. As these legislative items  were developed, considered, and passed, Diane Wolf provided a wealth of ideas, expertise, and counsel, and the results of her efforts will prove beneficial to Americans and their Capitol for perhaps as long as this building shall stand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As stated in the Capitol Preservation Commission law, the purpose of that Commission is to provide for "improvements in, preservation of, and acquisitions for, the United States Capitol" Additionally, through the Congressional Bicentennial Coin Program, Congress celebrated its inception and history by authorizing the minting of three commemorative coins, the surcharges of which were made available to the Capitol Preservation Commission for the preservation and improvement of the Capitol. As  I stated on the Senate floor on October 7, 1988, these proceeds would provide historic art, furnishings, and documents for display in public areas of the Capitol to be seen by millions of Americans and international visitors for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diane Wolf was a very accomplished individual. She earned her undergraduate degree cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania, became a teacher with masters degree in education from Columbia University, and later became an attorney after graduating the Georgetown University Law Center. She served as President of the Capitol Hill chapter of the Federal Bar Association and was a member of the Senate Preservation Board of Trustees. Ms. Wolf also contributed actively to several other national  and local civic organizations. She served on boards and councils supporting the National Archives, the Library of Congress, National Public Radio, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Georgetown University Law Center, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Kennedy Center for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, no description of Diane Wolf would be complete without recognizing the generosity of her spirit, the strength of her character, and the cheerful nature of her personality. She met everyone with a bright smile, and very often she humbly and quietly lent a hand to others, asking nothing in return. She was respected by Members of Congress and their staff, not only for her knowledge and advice, but also for her genuine friendliness, gracefulness, and humor. She was much admired  and appreciated by everyone in the Capitol community, including secretaries, doorkeepers, elevator operators, and Capitol Police alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diane Wolf will be missed. I join my Senate colleagues in conveying to her family deepest condolences, and with great respect repeat here the words of Adon 'Olam, one of the most familiar hymns in all of Jewish liturgy:</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that my following statement appear in the Record as if read contemporaneous with consideration of the resolution honoring the life of Diane Wolf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate was deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Diane. Her passion for art and philanthropy lead her to devote her considerable talents to the service of countless organizations and causes. Diane was an attorney, teacher, and civic leader. Much of her work was dedicated to the preservation of the very building in which we meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife, Catherine, and I worked closely with Diane on her efforts to preserve and restore the U.S. Capitol. Diane was passionate about the Capitol's history and symbolism. She enjoyed the pomp and circumstance of the Presidential inauguration and the annual tradition of the President's State of the Union Address. Her contributions as a member of the board of trustees of the U.S. Senate Preservation Commission were invaluable. It was her support and guidance that led to the development of the  commemorative coins which marked the bicentennial of the U.S. Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Reagan appointed Diane to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in 1985. Her father, Erving, says Diane considered that appointment as a full-time job. Diane demanded high quality in all endeavors. She believed a thing worth doing is worth doing well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her tenure on the Commission she strongly advocated redesigning our coins to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights and update the Presidential portraits. She believed that American coinage could recapture our imagination and become highly prized by collectors. This is just one example of how Diane used her creativity, intelligence, and boundless energy to promote art in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her vision has been realized in recent years, as the Mint produced new designs for the quarter with images representing each of the 50 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diane's energy and passion for public service will be missed. The institutions she served and the lives she touched benefited greatly from her dedication, generosity, and lively spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Catherine and I are fortunate to know Diane's wonderful family. She cherished her relationships with her parents, Erving and Joyce, and her brothers Daniel and Matthew. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their loved ones.</paragraph>
