  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 319 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials into the Record.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings). During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this rule permits the House to consider the Water Resources Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The structured rule makes in order six amendments. As yesterday's debate in the Rules Committee demonstrated, Members on both sides of the aisle are focused on getting this bill to conference and onto the President's desk, and this rule reflects that consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been well documented that our country has not had a WRDA bill in over 7 years. Seven years is perilously close to an entire generation passing without a national water resources policy being signed into law by a President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill made in order under this rule authorizes nearly $14 billion for the construction of more than 700 water resources development projects and studies by the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, navigation, and environmental restoration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill> authorizes hurricane recovery activities along the gulf coast that would cost an estimated $3 billion. Furthermore, the bill requires an external peer review for studies of projects that would cost more than $50 million. The bill also coordinates environmental analyses and other permit processes among Federal and State agencies and authorizes environmental quality initiatives. In short, this bill today moves our country forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district of Sacramento, California, this WRDA bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that will pass Congress this year. We have been waiting a long time for this bill. Sacramento is the most at-risk river city in this country for catastrophic flooding. Located at the confluence of the great Sacramento and American Rivers, the Sacramento floodplain contains over 165,000 homes, over 488,000 residents, 1,300 government facilities including the State capital, and businesses  providing 200,000 jobs. It is the hub of a six-county regional economy that provides 800,000 jobs for 1.5 million people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A major flood along the American River or the Sacramento River would cripple this economy, and cost upwards of $35 billion in direct property damages and likely result in a significant loss of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sacramento has had major floods throughout its history, the last major floods being in 1986 and 1997. We live with a constant threat of catastrophic flooding. In my district, we understand the need and urgency for an overarching water resources policy to protect our homes, businesses, and families. This bill, the projects and policies  it contains, goes a long way in addressing my district and our country's flood vulnerabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, regions across the country are starving for a Federal partner in water resources policy. Our country is confronted with population growth, climate change and growing demands on our water infrastructure. Our districts across this country need this bill, and the Members in this Chamber have repeatedly supported WRDA bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 108th Congress, WRDA passed the House by a vote of 412-8. In the 109th Congress, WRDA passed the House 406-14. There is a strong history of support and bipartisanship for WRDA bills. It is my hope that this support continues and that we will move forward on this very important work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate and thank Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and the full committee chairman, Jim Oberstar, for their commitment to make this bill a priority in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the underlying Water Resources Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the 107th, 108th, and the 109th Congresses, the House considered and passed legislation to provide for conservation and development of water and related resources, and to authorize the construction of various projects in order to improve rivers and harbors in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, differences could not be resolved with the other body, and these bipartisan bills, therefore, did not become law. The legislation before us today mirrors legislation that was approved by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the House in the last Congress, and I am confident it will enjoy large bipartisan support today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our Nation's water resource infrastructure is critical to our economy, transportation system, power generation, flood control and environmental protection and restoration. This is especially true in my area in the Pacific Northwest. Our region's major river, the Columbia River and its tributaries, is a great resource, one that must be well managed and protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hydroelectric dams provide clean, low-cost, renewable power. These facilities also provide a system of locks that allow for the efficient transportation of tons of agricultural products to coastal ports, which reduces congestion on our highways and our rail systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coastal ports that receive the river-barged goods and products are the gateways to overseas markets and also need careful attention. The success of farmers and manufacturers throughout the Pacific Northwest depend on these ports being navigable and appropriately maintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions in the Water Resources Development Act that are important to individuals and communities that I represent in central Washington, and I would like to highlight those provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the WRDA bill passed by the House in the last Congress, I am particularly pleased that the committee has included language in the manager's amendment to permit Corps of Engineer employees working at dams in the Pacific Northwest to participate in wage surveys that are conducted to determine their rate of pay. This important provision would allow these employees the same participation allowed to similar employees at dams in the region operated by the Bonneville Power Administration and the  Bureau of Reclamation. This is a matter of fair and equal treatment, and I appreciate the committee agreeing with my request on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes language that would allow the Corps to officially give credit to the Port of Sunnyside for funding it has invested to maintain progress on its wetland restoration and wastewater treatment project. This project is a creative initiative by the Port of Sunnyside to improve river habitat in the Yakima River, and provide for greater economic growth in the local community. This provision ensures that the Port of Sunnyside gets proper credit for funds it invested as it works  with the Corps to make this project a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation lifts Corps restrictions on the development of several Port of Pasco properties. I am very hopeful that elimination of these flowage easements will allow beneficial uses of this prime riverfront property to move forward for the betterment of Pasco and the Tri-Cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must keep our commitment to sustain and enhance our Nation's water resource infrastructure, and that requires a regular review and updating of congressional direction to the Corps of Engineers to ensure that existing projects are maintained and that new needs are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that this necessary legislation will soon become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlelady's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this rule and on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further appreciate what this represents. It has been my privilege to serve for the last 10 years on the Water Resources Subcommittee for Transportation and Infrastructure. Over that period of time, I have watched as we have focused legislation to deal with the amazing needs that face water resources around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the legislation that we have passed through this House with strong support in recent Congresses has never been able to find its way into law. I think that with this legislation, we are able to find a way to help break the impasse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to speak to one of the elements that was in that legislation that has been made in order by the Rules Committee, an amendment that I am offering along with my colleagues Peter Welch and Tom Petri to help bring the Corps of Engineers into the 21st century by updating the principles and guidelines under which it operates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment takes a step back from the politics and controversies that have surrounded the Corps' activities over recent years. In fact, there has been some finger-pointing at the Corps, but frankly, Congress itself is part of the problem and can be part of a process that can help move this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These principles and guidelines are used for the formulation, evaluation, and implementation of water resources projects. The current rules under which the Corps operates have not been updated since 1983. It seems hard to believe, given how important water resources are and how much we have learned about the science, about hydrology since 1983.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about it for a moment. In 1983, Ronald Reagan was President. We were dealing with the movie "Return of the Jedi." A year later, the 3.5-inch floppy disk was introduced, and IBM was soon to launch the first portable computer which weighed 30 pounds. Half the people who work for me in my congressional office weren't even born in 1983.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every Member of the House is aware how much has changed since 1983 in terms of technology, science, environmental policy, our national priorities, and our understanding of water resources. Yet, the Corps of Engineers and the thousands of dedicated men and women who work for them have a planning process that has not kept up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my privilege with the former head of the Corps, General Flowers, to meet with representatives of all of the planning agencies for the Corps across the country. They understand the problems; they are striving to make some adjustments. We are still developing projects, yet they are still working under an umbrella that was based on principles and guidelines when James Watt was Secretary of the Interior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is very simple. It directs the Secretary of the Army to update the principles and guidelines in consultation with all the other Federal agencies that have a stake in the process, to work with the public to deal with what we have learned over the last quarter of a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very important step on addressing criticisms from the National Academy of Sciences, the OMB, the Government Accountability Office, and others. It does not impact any project that currently is approved or under way, none of the projects that are listed in the bill we have before us, but it is going to help us change the process to get at the root of a long-term problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing the amendment will not delay any projects or tie the hands of the Corps in any way. In fact, I am convinced that it will break the paralysis for projects in the future by making sure they are structurally, fiscally, and environmentally sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some projects around the country that have been delayed in recent years due not just to funding, although that is a serious issue, but due to lawsuits and other controversy. The ones that I have looked at that have met bumps in the road were in this situation in the main because they weren't properly planned and ground-truthed, as they say; and they have stirred up unnecessary controversy in some instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will make it easier to approve and construct good projects in the future. This amendment will make it easier for the House and the Senate, which in the past have been at loggerheads over principles of Corps reform. I think this is an area of common ground that will bring people together. This amendment represents a fresh break. It won't solve all of the problems of the Corps, that will await another day; but with this amendment, it gives us a chance at a new beginning for Congress  to be positively involved in these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We start by equipping the Corps with the latest science and analytic tools to bring them into the 21st century rather than tying their hands with out-of-date policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge that each of my colleagues join with me in supporting our amendment, which is endorsed by Clean Water Action, Taxpayers for Commonsense, Republicans for Environmental Protection, the National Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth, American Rivers, the National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense, the League of Conservation Voters, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the people who are charged with making these projects work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I deeply appreciate the progress that this represents in bringing us forward. I appreciate the Rules Committee making it in order, and look forward to being able to carry this amendment to the floor, hopefully for its approval, and being able to break the impasse surrounding water resources projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of the tragedy we saw with Hurricane Katrina, with the flooding that has occurred in the Northeast just in recent days, this legislation is more important than ever.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would just yield to my friend from California for an explanation on this.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is a Washington, D.C. aqueduct project that inadvertently violates PAYGO. This modification strikes the provision from the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>So it takes that provision that violates the PAYGO from the bill?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>It inadvertently violates, so we struck it out.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my objection.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the modification is accepted.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue. Our country needs a comprehensive water resources policy, and WRDA is the framework that can meet this need. We have 7 years of backlogged water projects that must be addressed. There is a growing demand on our already overburdened water infrastructure. The sooner we move forward on this bill, the sooner our communities across the country will be healthier and safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
