    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from American Samoa?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me first commend our distinguished colleague and former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), for being the author of and introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the strong alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea has been a pivotal relationship in world affairs since our involvement when we fought side by side in the Korean war over half a century ago. Out of that conflict was born one of the most significant dividing lines of the Cold War, a demilitarized zone on the 38th parallel that splits the Korean Peninsula and marked the divide between Communist Asia and democratic Asia. The partnership between our two countries  held this line for decades. Today we help maintain a stable peace in Southeast Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the post-Cold War period, the Republic of Korea has remained a steadfast U.S. ally. It has contributed troops and pledged reconstruction funds for Iraq, and its forces are deployed in Afghanistan. As a key member of the six-party talks to denuclearize North Korea, it shares an important responsibility for broader security in Northeast Asia. Today we are committed absolutely to compelling the dangerous North Korea regime to eliminate its nuclear program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, South Korea is a key partner and an ally in the challenge of combating world terrorism. The combination of emerging terrorism threats and the North Korean challenge makes this resolution particularly important today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly want to commend my good friend, Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill of the State Department, for his diligence and efforts in negotiating with the North Koreans in the six-party talks. I would be remiss if I did not also recognize a most significant contribution made by the Republic of China and the help that they have contributed in bringing the North Koreans to the negotiating table and for which the negotiations are now ongoing, hopefully to bring about a resolution to this important  problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In economic realms, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. relationship with the Republic of Korea is one of our strongest in Asia. The Republic of Korea was one of the original East Asian Tigers and served as a model for other countries in Asia with its booming economic growth in the seventies, eighties and nineties. South Korea now is the United States' seventh largest trading partner in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution honors the close alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea and recognizes South Korea's important contributions to fighting not only terrorism around the world, but also welcomes a strengthening and deepening of the relationship between our two countries and our peoples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I was in Vietnam, I remember vividly the presence of some 50,000 soldiers from South Korea who served alongside us, the U.S. forces. I kind of like to say now you know where your real friends are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of a Chinese proverb: there are many acquaintances, but very few friends. South Korea was one of those few friends who was willing to put their action where their talk is; and the fact that 50,000 soldiers were there fighting along U.S. forces and in that terrible conflict that we faced in Vietnam, I cannot help but express my personal commendation and appreciation to the leaders and to the people of South Korea when they were there with us when we needed help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited South Korea several times and I consider them the most industrious people on this planet. There are over 1 million Korean Americans living in our country today, some among the most prominent in the areas of science and doctors. They have become lawyers, engineers and are in all types of businesses. I have a very strong affection for the Korean people and those fellow citizens who happen to be of Korean ancestry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think this resolution is most fitting. Again, I commend my good friend, the gentleman from New York, for offering and proposing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution, which recognizes the enduring ties of an alliance first forged over half a century ago in the crucible of the Korean War. It was heartening to see the photographs from Seoul of the thousands of South Korean citizens who gathered in a downtown plaza on June 6, Korea's memorial day, to express their support of the alliance. They waved South Korean flags and the Stars and Stripes together to show enthusiasm for the strong bonds that  link our two countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later this month, June 25, marks the 57th anniversary of the North Korean invasion across the Demilitarized Zone. This surprise attack in the early hours of a Sunday morning sought to snuff the life out of an embryonic South Korean democracy. President Harry Truman's immediate unflinching decision to come to the aid of an embattled South Korea proved that the United States would not retreat from its rendezvous with destiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together with our South Korean and other allies, we turned the tide of war at Inchon and preserved the South Korean state, which we honor as an ally today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Korea's commitment to the alliance is seen in many ways, as in the 1,200 South Korean military personnel deployed to Iraq, which makes South Korea's contribution the third largest in the coalition contingent. There is also the $460 million which the Republic of Korea has pledged toward postwar Iraq reconstruction, and there are the close consultations we hold together in the six-party process to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. These are the actions of a true and loyal friend, for  which we express our gratitude in this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also take this opportunity to second the words of the United States forces Korea commander, General Bell, that South Korea Sergeant Yoon Jang-ho, who was South Korea's first uniformed casualty in the war on terror, was a hero. Sergeant Yoon was killed February 27 by a suicide bomber in Bagram, Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This young soldier, although born in Korea, had spent his high school and college years in Indiana, graduating from Indiana University. He returned to South Korea to complete his military service and volunteered for service in Afghanistan. His loss was deeply felt, both in his home nation of Korea and his adopted hometown of Bloomington, Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The shared mourning of the peoples of two nations for this valiant soldier is one more concrete indication of the ties that bind our two nations. Another, of course, is the talent and dynamism of the 2-million-strong ethnic Korean community in the United States. Los Angeles represents the largest concentrated urban center of Korean culture outside of the Korean Peninsula. For this enriching contribution to America's melting pot, we are extremely grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I therefore urge immediate passage of this resolution which recognizes this strong and enduring alliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again I want to commend and thank my good friend for his eloquent statement and add that this is not a partisan piece of legislation. It is fully bipartisan. I certainly commend not only our distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, but also our senior ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their support of this proposed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is ironic that we are dealing with several pieces of legislation, earlier on being the Olympics, and now we are dealing with South Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember years ago when I attended the Olympics in 1988 in Korea, I ran into a gentleman who is a Korean American by the name of Dr. Sammy Lee. I asked him why this Samoan American was so good in the art of diving, perhaps one of the greatest Olympic divers ever in the history of the Olympics, whose name is none other than Greg Louganis. I asked Dr. Sammy Lee, why is it that Greg Louganis was such a great Olympic diver? He said, Eni, look at his legs. They are Samoan legs, and the reason for  this is that it gives him the ability to jump higher than any of his Olympic competitors. And because he can jump higher than anybody, that is what gives him the opportunity to accomplish more difficult flips than any of the other divers. By the way, Dr. Sammy Lee was also the trainer for Greg Louganis in the Olympics in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another note of interest is that when I talked to Dr. Sammy Lee when he was training for the Olympics, he could not even train together with his fellow white Americans while he was training for the Olympics. Can you believe that? So he had to invent what high diving boards were supposed to look like, whether it be going on cliffs or other high platforms to allow him to practice his diving ability. And guess what? He got the gold medal for the United States for the Olympics, a Korean American,  Dr. Sammy Lee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to make that as a note of interest for my colleagues and also in view of the fact that we have talked about the Olympics and we have talked about South Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, this resolution is very important to show our sense of appreciation, especially to the good leaders and the people of South Korea, how much we care about them, how important they are, how important they are to our strategic and our economic interests in that important region of the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="295">H.R. 295</bill>, and, in doing so, I would first like to commend Mr. KING for introducing this resolution. The relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea has been a pivotal relationship in world affairs since our forces fought side by side in Korean War over a half century ago. Out of that conflict marked the divide between communist Asia and democratic Asia. The partnership between us and  the Republic of Korea held the divide for decades, and together we helped maintain stable peace in East Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the post-Cold War world, the Republic of Korea has remained a steadfast U.S. ally. Its forces are deployed in Afghanistan and it has contributed troops and pledged reconstruction funds for Iraq. As a key member of the Six Party Talks to denuclearize North Korea, it shares an important responsibility for broader security in Northeast Asia. Together, we are committed absolutely to compelling the dangerous North Korean regime to eliminate its nuclear program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, South Korea is a key partner an ally in the challenge of combating terrorism worldwide. The combination of emerging terrorism threats and the North Korean challenge make this resolution particularly important today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the economic realm, too, the U.S. relationship with the Republic of Korea is one of our strongest in Asia. For example, the Republic of Korea was one of the original "East Asian Tigers," and served as a model for other Asian countries with a booming economic growth in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Currently, South Korea is now the United States' 7th largest trading partner in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud to stand as one of cosponsors of this legislation. This resolution honors the close alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea, and recognizes South Korea's important contributions to fighting against terrorism around the world. It also welcomes the strengthening and deepening of the relationship between our two countries and our peoples. I thank all of my colleagues who have already signed on to this bill, and I urge those who have not to support  this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="295">H. Res. 295</bill>, a resolution recognizing the strong alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States and expressing appreciation to the Republic of Korea for its efforts in the Global War on Terror. As the sponsor of this resolution, I join with over 35 of my colleagues in urging the House to pass this resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost six decades, the United States and the Republic of Korea have maintained a strong alliance that rests on a shared commitment to peace, democracy, and freedom not only on the Korean peninsula but throughout Asia and the rest of the world. The nearly 30,000 American soldiers who remain stationed in the Republic of Korea are a testament to this relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since September 11, 2001 we have seen this bond further strengthened as Korea has joined with the United States and other coalition nations in supporting the Global War on Terror both militarily and financially. Korean President Roh truly understands this grave threat and the need for it to be confronted. Presently, the Republic of Korea has the third largest coalition contingent of forces in Iraq. Korea also has troops deployed in Afghanistan and has generously pledged $460,000,000 toward reconstruction  and stabilization efforts in post-war Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. and Korea also both remain deeply committed to the Six Party Talks and have  a mutual interest in keeping the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the U.S. and Korea have been working diligently on a free trade agreement between our two countries that will deepen economic ties and boost trade and investment for both countries. I am pleased that these negotiations concluded on April 1, 2007 and it is my hope that the agreement will soon be signed and Congress passes the required enacting legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass this resolution today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="295">H. Res. 295</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution recognizes the tremendous alliance that the United States shares with the Republic of Korea. Korea has been one of this country's strongest allies, both in the international war on terror, as well as in expanding free trade. Korea stands as a shining example of democracy in action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 11th Congressional District of Virginia, I represent a growing and vigorous Korean American population. Korean Americans thrive in areas such as business, medicine, law, art and athletics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Korean Americans own and operate over 130,000 businesses and employ over 333,000 individuals. These are prime examples of their importance in the United States and to the growth of our economy. It is clear to me that the strong alliance between the United States and  the Republic of Korea can be seen everyday in the neighborhoods and workplaces right here in the Washington, D.C. area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republic of Korea's strong belief in upholding individual rights and liberties serves as an example for the entire Korean peninsula, as well as beyond. Korea's 2,300 troops deployed in Iraq and 200 troops deployed in Afghanistan indicate not only Korea's support of our efforts in ending terrorism abroad, but also illustrate Korea's strong commitment to spreading democracy throughout the world. Indeed, Korea has been one of our most ardent and unfailing allies abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we honor an ally who is standing with us in the Global War on Terrorism. An ally who knows what it is like to fight for peace and freedom, South Korea. Just over 50 years ago, Korea was the most violent spot on the planet as the North Korean government, backed by the Soviets and Chinese, swooped in to destroy the fledgling democracy in the south.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution which recognizes the significant contributions that the South Korean military has made in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Our South Korean allies maintain the third largest contingent of personnel in Iraq, where they are helping each day to rebuild that nation and spread the freedom they too earned with blood, sweat, and grit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While as many as 3,600 personnel have at some time served, currently 2,300 work in the country to provide medical services, build and repair roads, power lines, schools, and other public works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republic of Korea has contributed both men and money to rebuilding Iraq because they know how difficult it is to rise from the ashes of war. Since the end of the Korean War, the people of South Korea have built one of the world's most modern and dynamic economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope that the Iraqi and Afghani people can look to the South Korean model to develop into a peaceful and prosperous nation. We thank the Republic of Korea and the Korean people for their sacrifice and their stand for freedom.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="295">H. Res. 295</bill>, a resolution that recognizes the strong alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States and further expresses appreciation to the Republic of Korea for its efforts in the global war against terrorism. The dynamic and strong relations that exist between the United States and Republic of Korea serve as a model for partnerships the United States must continue to seek to establish and cultivate with other countries  within the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contributions made by the government of the Republic of Korea toward helping battle terrorism are vital to providing for safety and security throughout the world. The efforts on the part of the Republic of Korea to help fight terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq and help develop democratic governance, strengthen civil society, and establish stronger economies in those countries are of particular importance to the United States and our allies. These missions are challenging ones. Their eventual,  positive outcomes are less than certain at this point. The commitment to achieving success in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom displayed by the Republic of Korea is commendable and an important component of the Coalition force structure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Efforts on the part of South Korea to encourage the government of North Korea to act in a responsible manner with respect to its misguided pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology are also of paramount importance at this time to the United States and our allies. I am encouraged by the strong partnership that has been formed between the United States and South Korea and other countries with respect to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I welcome the opportunity to continue to work with our South Korean allies toward ensuring a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous Asia-Pacific region and world. I am confident that the United States and South Korea will develop even stronger political, economic, and security ties in the years ahead. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
