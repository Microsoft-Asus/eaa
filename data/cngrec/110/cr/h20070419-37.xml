    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in recognition of Jack Calvert for 16 years of service as the mayor of the city of Lampasas in the 11th District of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Calvert graduated from New Mexico Military Institute in 1956 and served in the Army as a second lieutenant. He served in various command and staff positions, including test officer in Greenland, assistant professor of chemistry at West Point, and he served in combat in Vietnam where he was awarded the Purple Heart. After a 3-year tour at the Pentagon, he served for 3 years in Germany. Mr. Calvert then served at Joliet Army Ammunition Plant and in 1979 was assigned to the Army War College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following this assignment, Mayor Calvert then served as the director of Battlefield Automation at Fort Hood and after 3 years he retired from the United States Army as a colonel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Calvert's service to his community and his country did not end after his retirement from the military. He then served on different civic groups. He and his wife, Fran, chose Lampasas as their home and purchased a historic house to restore back to its original structure. Along with his service, he and his wife, Fran, raised three children: Charles Douglas, Lee Ann, and Mary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mayor of Lampasas, he successfully guided the city and its councils through many growth issues. Jack Calvert is a true leader of leaders in the 11th Congressional District, and I am proud to represent him here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
