  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's befitting that you are in the Speaker's chair today as we discuss this very important hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the pleasure to manage this hour on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus. And we're going to be talking about black history and women's history, a combination of last month and this month's themes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by saying that we will have an opportunity to discuss the state of black women in America and pay tribute to African American women in our communities. We felt it befitting, as we recently celebrated Black History Month in February and currently are in the midst of Women's History Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight we will begin by highlighting some of the findings from the recent study of "The State of Black America," released by the Urban League, and discussing some of the wonderful women from our own congressional districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin now by yielding time to my colleague and good friend from the great State of California, Diane Watson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and my honorable colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, thank you for this opportunity to salute our women over a period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like now to introduce you to a woman by the name of Mayme Clayton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayme Clayton, a renowned librarian, worked her entire life to assemble a priceless collection of historical artifacts. The collection was assembled over a 40-year period by Mayme A. Clayton, 1923 to 2006, a career librarian at the University of Southern California in my district, and University of California, Los Angeles, my alma mater. And Dr. Clayton's singular commitment to preserve African American culture and history was inspired by her desire to ensure that children would know the richness  and diversity of African American contributions to the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mayme A. Clayton Collection of African American History and Culture is comprised of seven main components. They are as follows: rare and out-of-print books, manuscripts, documents, films, music, photographs, and memorabilia. The collection is a remarkable cultural treasure, with a vast ability to educate and to delight. It is our hope that this particular collection will be explored on the Web site to learn more about the collection and why Dr. Mayme Clayton assembled it, and the goals of  the Western States Black Research and Educational Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a research center, and it's scheduled to receive a Federal grant to refurbish its facilities that are located in my district, Culver City, California. The center will be known as the Mayme Clayton Library, and it has housed the largest collection of rare books, films, recordings, and other documents on black Americans outside of the Schomburg Library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Clayton's historic efforts have not been in vain, but can rightfully serve as historical and intellectual nourishment for this generation as well as future generations of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>When she learned that there was a location for her rare collection, which she kept in her garage, and I remember going over as a student at UCLA and going through her works for a paper that I had to do, I knew that she would outgrow that space and would have to find a place that could rightfully house such a precious collection. But we found a place for her. It was the old courthouse in Culver City. As you know, you cannot sell a courthouse; so we're on loan. They lent it to us for a period of  time, and we're going to see that Federal grants go to that library to preserve this collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am so pleased to put that name into your psyche because she has skillfully, artfully, and scholarly recorded our history, as written by slaves themselves and written by free men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayme Clayton, a true African American heroine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, for giving me this time to talk about Mayme Clayton.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague for always being with me and supporting me and the Congressional Black Caucus on issues that we present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to begin this evening by paying tribute to one of my she-roes and a pillar of the 11th Congressional District of Ohio and the Cleveland community, Judge Jean Murrell Capers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 95 years of age, Judge Jean Murrell Capers is still ticking and kicking. Known for her feistiness and zest for life, Judge Capers has been a trailblazer for many black women including myself in the law and politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Kentucky, Judge Capers moved to Cleveland with her family 88 years ago. She still resides in the family house located in the heart of Cleveland. Judge Capers credits her parents with her success and longevity to the teachings instilled in her by her parents: "My parents provided my four siblings and me with what we needed, not what we wanted. The two things that impact on the individual are heredity and environment. The most important thing for you is to learn."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1932 Judge Capers began teaching in the Cleveland Public Schools. She went on to receive her law degree from Case Western Reserve University, which she calls the "Harvard of the Midwest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raised as a devout Presbyterian, Judge Capers says that the Bible and the Constitution are the two books she lives by. Through the teachings of the Bible and her Christian upbringing, she learned the importance of serving the community. That belief led her into politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Capers began her profession in law and politics in 1945. She was the first black woman in the United States to be elected a city council member and the first to serve as an assistant county prosecutor in Cuyahoga County. Because of her commitment to her community, Judge Capers was appointed by then Governor James Rhodes to serve as a municipal court judge, a position she was elected to once her appointment expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A member of my great sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Judge Capers has accumulated numerous awards including the Frances Payne Bolton Award presented by the Western Reserve Republican Club and has been inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interesting thing about Judge Capers' life is the fact that she was born on the very day that Delta Sigma Theta was founded and in the very same year. So we always call her our representative of Delta Sigma Theta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Widely recognized for her gorgeous hats, Judge Capers continues to be an advocate for all people in the community. She still practices law at the age of 95. I can honestly say there would be no Stephanie Tubbs Jones were it not for Judge Jean Murrell Capers. So tonight I'm pleased to recognize her for her life of service and for all that she does on behalf of candidates throughout the State of Ohio and throughout the United States of America. Tonight she's still actively involved in the presidential  elections. Though we're not on the same side, I still love her dearly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me go on to talk now about the Urban League's State of Black America Study. Urban League president and CEO Marc Morial states: "By uplifting black women, especially those struggling hardest to keep their families together and their dreams on track, we lift up every American community."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to applaud the Urban League for having the vision to highlight the issues of black women in this country in this year's report. Oftentimes our issues are overlooked and/or marginalized. I would like to share with you a few excerpts from some of the essays featured in this year's report. This year's essayists do a fantastic job of highlighting the many struggles of black women in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Black women and the workplace: In her essay "African American Women and Work: Still a Tale of Two Cities," Alexis Herman has this to say regarding the inequality women face in the workplace:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Over the last 60 years, the labor force participation of women has more than doubled, which means nearly one out of every two workers is a woman. However, this increase in labor force participation was driven largely by non-African American women deciding to work outside their homes. African American women have a long history of working outside of their homes and have the highest labor force participation rate among women, 63.4 percent. Not only are more women working, but more of these working  women are mothers as well. Further, one in four married working women earn more than their husbands. However, many African American women are concentrated in low-paying service jobs or staff positions. African American women are 6 percent of the workforce but 14 percent of workers earning between $15,000 and $30,000 per year and are less than 1 percent of workers earning over $100,000 per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taking the conversation even deeper is Dr. Julianne Malveaux, who in her essay, "Shouldering the Third Burden: The status of African American Women," she states:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The labor market presents the most striking example of the third burden. Black men and women both experience higher unemployment rates than the general population. However, the unemployment and underemployment of black men shifts a disproportionate economic responsibility onto the shoulders of African American women, who then must support households and children without sufficient contribution from their spouses, partners, or fathers. The failure of public policy to create jobs and access to  employment in the wake of urban deindustrialization puts African American men at a particular disadvantage and thereby places the burden of family survival on African American women."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another article about black women and the foreclosure crisis is written by Andrea Harris, the president of the North Carolina Institute for Minority Economic Development, and she had this to say about the impact of the foreclosure crisis and its effect on African American women:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Nearly two-thirds of the wealth possessed by African American families is in the form of home equity. Without homeownership most of these households own very little and have few opportunities to build economic security. Half of all African American households with children are headed by women; therefore, homeownership is an important economic advantage for these families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act was enacted to abolish redlining, but it created a market for predatory lending. A recent report by the Consumer Federation of America notes that subprime loans have gone disproportionately to women and that African American and Latina women have the highest rates of subprime lending when compared to all other Americans, especially white men who receive the lowest share of subprime  loans. Moreover, the disparity  increases as income increases. In fact, upper-income African American women are more than five times more likely to receive a subprime mortgage than white men. Since subprime borrowers typically refinance from one subprime loan to another, this translates into projected foreclosures for more than one-third of subprime borrowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Considering that over half of all loans made to black borrowers in 2005 and 2006 were subprime and that African American women accounted for 48.8 percent of all African American subprime borrowers in 2006, it is easy to imagine the devastation that is headed toward black women and their communities. A January, 2008, report issued by United for a Fair Economy says that the subprime mortgage crisis will drain $213 billion in wealth from black Americans, producing for African Americans the greatest  wealth loss in modern U.S. history."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about black women's health for a moment. Dr. Doris Browne, president and CEO of Brown &amp; Associates, Inc., had these observations about the impact of health disparities on African American women:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Particularly striking are disparities in the occurrence of illness and death experienced by African Americans caused by higher rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, AIDS, and a shorter life expectancy. For instance, heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States. However, the death rate for heart disease is 20 percent higher for African American women than white women. In addition, cancer is the second leading cause of death among women; yet  the 5-year survival rate is 10 percent lower for African American women compared to their white female counterparts. Also, 15 million black women in the United States are afflicted with diabetes, roughly double the number of U.S. white women who are diagnosed with the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"With regard to HIV and AIDS, 61 percent of those under age 25 with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS are African American, and African American women are diagnosed with AIDS at a rate nearly 24 times higher than white women. Black women are more likely to be infected by heterosexual means, sexual contact with men who are HIV positive, compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Possible explanations for these disparities are the complex interaction of biological factors, environment, ethnicity, insurance,  and certain health behaviors or life-style choices. Equally important are the effects of socioeconomic factors such as education and income in creating health disparities. For African American women, poverty, race, and ethnicity play a significant role in lower health quality and health outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Overcoming persistent health disparities and promoting healthy behaviors for African Americans is a formidable health challenge. African American women must devote more time to care for their own health needs because health education, awareness, and screening are essential in preventing and controlling chronic diseases in women."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these points that have been made in this wonderful publication by the Urban League point to issues that predominate in the African American community, which particularly fall upon African American women in our country. The Urban League should be applauded for focusing in on the state of black women in America. And we focus in again around education, around health care, around job opportunities, around income within the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we have been looking at issues around women and the workplace, one of the things that we have noticed persistently is that women still only make about 70 cents of every dollar that men make in the workplace, and we have to continue to fight for our opportunity to be paid equally in the workplace. It becomes even a greater dilemma as we focus in on the foreclosure crisis, which has caused so many families to go under.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the State of Ohio, 90,000 houses or homes in Ohio are in the predatory lending process. I am told that the number across the country is somewhere around 900,000 families or houses in this country are in debt or in trouble as a result of the foreclosure crisis. It becomes even more important that Members of Congress and my colleagues begin to focus in on these issues and try to do what we can to assist those families in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the dilemmas that we really face as well is, though, that the proposals that have been placed upon the table to try to fix the foreclosure process have not really focused on the people who are stuck in the foreclosure. They are more focused on the banking and financial institutions than on the people and the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We need to push as Members of Congress to make sure that we pursue other opportunities to assist people who are really in need of our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is exciting as we go on and celebrate Black History Month and Women's History Month together that we think about all the great leaders and great women who have come before us in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had an opportunity about 2 weeks ago to be in Akron, Ohio, with a group of women. We were focusing on Women's History Month and that great woman, Sojourner Truth, an African American woman who was a leader in the suffragette movement, even though she recognized back then, even though she fought on behalf of the suffragette movement, that she as an African American woman would not have the opportunity to have the right to vote, even if she won the suffragette movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recalled in our discussion this great speech that she gave that was called "Ain't I a Woman?" and she talked about that she had worked and slaved in cotton fields, that she was able to till the land just like a man, that she was able to cut down trees like a man and she said, But ain't I a woman? And she went on to talk about the fact that women across this country have worked very hard and very diligently but, in fact, they have not been given the rights or recognition that they should.  And she ends this great speech by saying, if one woman can be determined to have turned this world upside down, surely all the women in this room ought to be able to turn it right side up again. And then she said, And the men ought to let them do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is an exciting time as we focus in on Women's History Month that we have a time to reflect on great women like Sojourner Truth and others who were leading the charge to make sure that women had the right to vote and participate in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am excited to discuss in that same vein 22 women, and these 22 women were the founders of my sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated. These 22 women had been part of another sorority and decided that they wanted to be more focused on political and social issues and created Delta Sigma Theta Sorority at Howard University back in 1913, the same year that Judge Jean Murrell Capers was born. Part of their first act was to participate in the suffragette march.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I gave a speech the other day that was interesting in the conversation that the people who put the march together, they wanted to push all the African American women to the back of the march because they knew that they would not be able to vote, but the African American women started participating in the march and they said, to heck with this, we're going to be at the front. And so they moved around the march and moved to the front of the march on behalf of the people that are represented. So  it was really women who were participating in the forefront that clearly had the chance to give us or set the example for what we should be able to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am just so pleased to have had this opportunity on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus to talk about Women's History Month, to talk about African American women who have done such a great job in the process. I am confident that my colleagues would have been here this evening but for other commitments and that is why I have sought to have the privilege to have them be able to revise and extend their remarks so that they can add information to this particular time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is always great to have a chance to participate in these Special Orders on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus; our Chair, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick; our Vice Chair, Barbara Lee, who happens to be the Speaker in the chair right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with that I am willing to yield back the balance of my time such that the next person who has a Special Order can come forward. I thank you for the time.</paragraph>
