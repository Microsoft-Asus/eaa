    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the accomplishments of the Kansas Air National Guard, specifically the 190th Air Refueling Wing which celebrates its 50th anniversary on February 23, 2007. The enormous sacrifice and dedication of these heroic men and women reflects well on themselves, the 190th Air Refueling Wing, and the Kansas Air National Guard. They truly make all Kansans proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This outstanding military organization began as the 117th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron located at the Hutchinson Naval Air Station in Hutchinson, KS. The unit was federally recognized on February 23, 1957. Over the course of its 50-year history, the 190th has flown the F-80, B-57A, B-57G, RB-57, EB-57, KC-135A, KC-135D, KC-135E and currently the KC-135R. The unit was stationed at Hutchinson Naval Air Station--later the Hutchinson Air National Guard Base--until 1967 when the unit was transferred  to Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, KS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 190th Air Refueling Wing at Forbes Field continues to be a leader in the Air National Guard. The unit recently received two prestigious awards--the Spaatz trophy--awarded to the overall outstanding Air National Guard Flying Wing--and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. We owe these brave servicemen, servicewomen, and their families a debt of gratitude. I thank them for their 50 years of service and extend my best wishes to them for the next 50 years and beyond.</paragraph>
