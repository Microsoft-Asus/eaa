    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate the St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center on its 40th anniversary. Since 1968, it has grown from its original mission to confront the "blockbusting" practices harming Baltimore's neighborhoods to providing a myriad of services to more than 100,000 Baltimoreans as our oldest nonprofit housing provider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center was founded in 1968 by the dynamic and tenacious Father Vincent Patrick Quayle, known to all as Vinny. The center is dedicated to creating and preserving affordable housing in Baltimore. Its many successes are due to the charismatic and effective leadership of Vinny Quayle and the tireless efforts of a dedicated staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1970s, St. Ambrose initiated a rental program and converted several vacant Catholic school buildings into affordable apartments. This effort led to neighborhood revitalization in many Baltimore communities. Today, St. Ambrose owns and manages 350 single and multifamily affordable housing units serving very low-income households, households with special needs, and the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Baltimore experienced a gentrification movement in the 1980s, many low income families, especially those renting their homes, feared they would be displaced. St. Ambrose led the way in helping tenants convert to homeownership and was instrumental in convincing Baltimore City to establish a "Tenant's Right of First Refusal" bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two other programs were established that have become core services at St. Ambrose. The Homesharing Program, the only one in Maryland, matches householders with room to share with homeseekers who need affordable housing and are willing to provide help with household tasks or financial support. The Legal Services Program helps homeowners and tenants combat home improvement fraud and predatory lending practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Ambrose partnered with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, and bought, renovated and sold Federal Housing Administration, FHA, properties to first-time homebuyers. Through its Homeownership Counseling Program, St. Ambrose serves more than 700 prospective homebuyers every year, with 100 of them purchasing a home within 6 months of completing housing counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the numbers of subprime mortgages and foreclosures have increased, St. Ambrose has stepped forward to help homeowners save their homes. Expert housing counselors provide assistance to homeowners in a number of ways and staff attorneys are available to provide legal review and action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am most proud to extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center on its 40th anniversary and ask my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
