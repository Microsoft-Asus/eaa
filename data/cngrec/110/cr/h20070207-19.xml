    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, February marks the 44th annual American Heart Month, an effort to raise awareness of the single largest cause of death for both men and women in this country, heart disease. Like the country as a whole, heart disease is the leading cause of death on my island of Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, heart disease is increasingly becoming an issue for Pacific Islander women. In fact, a recent Centers for Disease Control study indicates that heart disease is responsible for 214 deaths per 100,000 women on Guam. This is a staggering rate, and only through greater awareness and education can we begin to confront this challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge everyone, Mr. Speaker, to take this opportunity to battle this disease by educating others about the benefits of healthy living and the risk factors contributing to heart disease.</paragraph>
