    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to talk about a sad situation we can do something about. A year ago this little girl, Veronica Rosenfeld, and her mom were walking in their Boca Raton neighborhood. This little girl, Veronica, was about 5 feet ahead of her mother on the sidewalk when a neighbor, not seeing little Veronica, backing out of the driveway, backed out over her and killed her. Her mother was right there, and there was nothing she could do about it. It is every parent's nightmare  to certainly see their child die, but how much more horrible to lose them and be totally helpless in preventing a senseless accident--an accident that could be prevented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about that, the prevention of the accident. Look what has happened in the last 6 years. There has been a 138-percent increase in the last 6 years in the number of children killed in these noncrash fatalities in which people back over a child because they can't see the child. Several children are killed every week in the United States, and sadly--and this is why I bring it up again; I have brought it up several times to the Senate--this past weekend in Florida, two more children died  in their driveways. In Hollywood, FL, a 3-year-old died when her father accidentally backed over her with his cargo van, and in Fort Myers, a 5-year-old was killed by her 16-year-old brother when he was parking the family car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this month alone, April, there have been 11 children backed over and killed in this country. These injuries and deaths continue to occur, even though we have the technology to prevent many of them. But we need legislation to put this technology to use. In April alone--and we are not even to the end of April--they have happened in Indiana, New York, Georgia, three in Florida, two in Texas, two in California, and one in Hawaii thus far. And it is only April 24.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why a bunch of us have gotten behind the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act. It is a bipartisan bill that would provide drivers with the means of detecting a child behind their vehicle. This bill would also ensure that power windows would automatically reverse direction to prevent a child from being trapped and mandate a car's service brake to engage to prevent rollaways. We have this technology in a lot of vehicles. We have been in the vehicles where there is a signal that goes  beep, beep, beep, and it becomes more frequent when an object is detected behind the car. The technology is there, and it is already being used. The same thing for windows. A child's head is in a window and suddenly the window goes up. It hits resistance and it reverses, and a parking brake automatically engages to prevent a rollaway on an incline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumer groups have teamed with the parents of victims to suggest ways that are relatively simple and inexpensive in order to ensure that more parents won't have to endure the pain of losing a child. The technology is there. We all want to be safe behind the wheel of a car, especially when we back up. How many times, when we back out of our garage, do we have that nagging thought: Is there a child behind this vehicle I cannot see? Why go through this trauma anymore? Let's pass this Kids and  Cars Safety Act, and then we can stop a lot of these needless deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will proceed in morning business. I believe I have time allotted to me.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority has 15 minutes.</chair>
