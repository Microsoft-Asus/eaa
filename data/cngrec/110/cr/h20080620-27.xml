  <narrative>THE NEED FOR AMERICAN-MADE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5776]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I got a letter from a constituent from Centralia, Illinois. He calls it Operation Drill Bit. He says, "Here's the problem. I'm tired of high gas prices. I'm tired of watching you borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. Here's the solution. It's time to drill for our own supply of oil no matter where it may lie. It is time to mine our own resources no matter where they may lie." He attaches a drill bit to the letter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm signing Lynn Westmoreland's pledge. I will join in the petition that I will continue to vote for more supply. The solution is more supply from the Outer Continental Shelf, coal-to-liquid technology, wind and solar, and renewable fuels. We need American-made energy. We need all of the above so that we can lower gas prices for the whole country at the pump. The poor, rural Americans are disproportionately harmed by high gas prices.</paragraph>
