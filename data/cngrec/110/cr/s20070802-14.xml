    <paragraph>Madam President, I have consulted with both of the managers about bringing up amendment No. 2557. I consulted with Senator Grassley, who advised that we would be going back on the bill at 12:45, but the distinguished Senator from West Virginia had extended his time. But I have been waiting here now for more than an hour. It would be my hope we could proceed with the consideration of this amendment. I am advised the managers want to see the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am advised, Madam President, that the Democrats are fine with my calling it up. I just want to be sure--</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, my understanding is that the Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. He can proceed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>In that event, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so we may consider amendment No. 2557.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The amendment has already been offered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes. Fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would eliminate the 1993 alternative minimum tax rate increase, a remedial step which I suggest to my colleagues is long overdue. The alternative minimum tax was created in 1969 in response to a small number of high-income individuals who had paid little or no Federal income taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, because of a lack of indexing for inflation, and the higher AMT tax rates relative to the regular income tax system, we have a parallel tax system which has grown far beyond its intended result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is no legislative action, the number of taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax will rise sharply from approximately 3.5 million filers in 2006 to some 23 million in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue has been before the Senate four times this year already. It will hit taxpayers in the moderate range excessively hard. The alternative minimum tax was increased in 1993 from 24 percent to 26 percent for taxable income under $175,000, and from 24 to 28 percent for taxable income in excess of $175,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been some question as to what is the offset and there is no offset, and none should be looked for where you have a tax which essentially was not expected to be imposed. There was no anticipation, no intention that this alternative minimum tax was going to produce additional revenue. So when the tax law is corrected so the additional taxes will not be imposed because of bracket creep--and this is designed to avoid that, and to redirect the alternative minimum tax to its original intent--that  is exactly what tax fairness requires.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It is a pretty simple, open-and-shut matter, and it does not take a whole lot of time to explain. I know the managers are not on the floor, but I did want to have the amendment considered, setting aside the other amendments, so we could engage in argument and be prepared to debate it further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless the Senator from Vermont indicates--with a hand gesture, a timeout, no argument at this time--I will be available to return to the floor when the managers consider it appropriate. But I wanted to get this on the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before departing, might I add my words of congratulations and admiration for the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I hadn't planned to listen to his extended speech, but I wanted to be here at the moment it concluded, because sometimes when you are not here, half a dozen Senators precede you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, as my colleagues know, this legislation, the SCHIP legislation, includes a $3 billion incentive pool, and the purpose of this pool is to provide States with the funding they need to do outreach efforts in order to attract children into the program. The reality is, however, a number of States today have already enrolled 90 percent of their kids into the SCHIP program, and with the passage of this bill, more States will soon be at that level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, we want to provide strong incentives for States below the 90-percent enrollment to reach that level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, in order to incentivize States to reach that level of 90 percent, would allow States to apply for multiple grants of up to $2 million each when they achieve an enrollment rate of greater than 90 percent of children below 200 percent of poverty. These grants would help assure the children we enroll in SCHIP have a place to go to receive medical care and to find the personnel they need to provide that care. These grants would come from a pool of money--the State Health Access Innovations  Pool--of $250 million, about 8 percent of the $3 billion incentive pool. This money will be used to find innovative approaches to increasing the availability of health and providers and services and would result in the direct provision of health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason for this initiative is pretty clear. In Vermont and in many other parts of this country, one can, in fact, have health insurance and yet find it quite difficult to buy or to find providers of that service. So what we are saying is let us make sure that when our kids do have health insurance, there will be doctors, there will be dentists, and there will be other health care providers. This is a good amendment, and I certainly hope it will be supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other amendment I have offered, amendment No. 2600, is a simple amendment to Section 111 of the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization. Section 111, as my colleagues know, applies to certain qualifying States that expanded their Medicaid Program to cover kids prior to the enactment of CHIP in 1997. I wish to commend the Finance Committee for working language into the current bill that will no longer penalize these "early expansion States" and will allow States to cover children  between 133 percent and 300 percent of the Federal poverty level to be covered under the CHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment simply states that payments to States to cover these children who were previously covered under Medicaid be used solely to fund health care-related activities. Specifically, the language states that payments may only be used to provide coverage or to expand access for health care infrastructure, including but not limited to the provision of school-based health services, dental care, mental health services, federally qualified health centers, and educational debt forgiveness for health  care practitioners in fields experiencing local shortages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is a simple provision that will specify that States benefiting from an increased match must use these funds for health care and will allow States to address coverage issues as well as the crucial area of expanding access to services, something that particularly affects rural and inner city communities. I urge support for this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="DRUG COMPANY PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes today to discuss an important issue that affects all Americans who take prescription drugs. Specifically, I am going to speak about the need for greater transparency in the payment that doctors who bill Medicare and Medicaid receive from drug companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few years, it became apparent during my inquiries into the Food and Drug Administration that drug companies pay physicians for a variety of different reasons. Indeed, some of our leading physicians--doctors who have significant influence in their medical fields--receive tens of thousands of dollars every year from drug companies. For some, these payments can make up a considerable amount of their annual income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The payments can take the form of honoraria for speaking engagements, payments to sit on advisory panels, and funding for research. Further, drug companies spend about $1 billion a year to fund educational courses that doctors are required to take every year called Continuing Medical Education, or CME.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April, the Finance Committee staff prepared a report on pharmaceutical companies' support of Continuing Medical Education. This report found that some educational courses supported by drug companies have become veiled forms of advertising that encourage off-label use of drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's review how this works. Right now, it is possible for a doctor to attend a CME--continuing medical education--course sponsored by a drug company. That same company can make payments to doctors who will teach the course, and the doctor who teaches the course can discuss the findings of research paid for by the company. Now, that may sound like a conflict and unethical, but that is how it happens. The whole field is connected by a tangled web of drug company money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To try and understand this a little better, I have been exploring the money doctors get from drug companies, especially the doctors who work as academic researchers. Most universities require their academic researchers to report outside income. I have sent letters to a handful of universities to understand how well such a reporting system actually works. I haven't received all the information yet, but I can comment on some of the things I have already found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most universities require professors to report outside income that may create a conflict of interest with their research. This means that if a doctor at a university is receiving money from a company either for research, speaking fees or to sit on an advisory panel, then they have to report that income. But there appears to be a couple of problems, and let's say a couple of problems with the whole system, as I found out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only person who knows if the reported income is accurate and complete is the doctor who is receiving the money. The university doesn't necessarily police its own people to make sure they are reporting everything they are supposed to report. It seems that some of these academics are getting so much money coming in from so many different companies they need an accountant to be sure everything is reported accurately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, these disclosures are usually kept secret. So if there is a doctor getting thousands of dollars from a drug company, payments that might be affecting his or her objectivity, the only people outside the pharmaceutical industry who will probably ever know about this are the people at that very university, if they are even keeping track of it, and we don't know that they are keeping track of it. But most Americans never get a fair chance to see this information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To give one example, I sent a letter to the University of Cincinnati asking about how much money the drug companies have been paying one of their psychiatrists, Dr. Melissa DelBello. Back in May, The New York Times reported on the research done by Dr. DelBello to see if adolescents could be treated for bipolar disorder with a powerful drug called Seroquel, which is manufactured by Astra Zeneca. The study was funded by Astra Zeneca and showed that Seroquel was a good choice for treating bipolar  disorder in children. Dr. DelBello's study was later cited by a prominent panel of experts who concluded that drugs such as Seroquel should be a first-line treatment for children with bipolar disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is where it gets interesting. After Dr. DelBello released her study, Astra Zeneca began hiring her to give several sponsored talks. Another doctor told The New York Times he was persuaded to start prescribing drugs  such as Seroquel after listening to Dr. DelBello. But when the reporter from the New York Times asked Dr. DelBello how much money she got from Astra Zeneca, she told the paper: "Trust me. I don't make much."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I decided to find out how much, and I went directly to the University of Cincinnati who, by the way, has been extremely cooperative, helpful, and responsive. Soon I figured out just how much "not that much" money is. Dr. DelBello's study, which helped put Seroquel on the map, was published in 2002. That next year, she got more money than she has ever received from the pharmaceutical companies--at least that is what the documents that I have say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Astra Zeneca alone paid her a little over $100,000 for lectures, consulting fees, travel expenses, and service on advisory boards. In 2004, Astra Zeneca paid her over $80,000 for the same services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I am not saying this money was a payoff or suggesting there is something inherently bad with accepting drug company money, but let me tell you what Dr. Steven E. Hyman, provost, Harvard University and former Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said these payments could encourage psychiatrists to use drugs in ways that endanger patients' physical health. Specifically, he said of doctors:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't connect the wires in our own lives about how money is affecting our profession and putting our patients at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a rather interesting assessment by Dr. Hyman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me continue. Just last March, several leading physicians released a study on pharmaceutical company payments to physicians. They published this study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the most prestigious journals in medicine. I would like to quote what they concluded about the need to provide public disclosure of these payments to doctors:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Full disclosure would better allow the public to appreciate the relationship between industry and the health profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, for the sake of transparency and accountability, shouldn't the American public know who their doctor is taking money from? After all, anybody can go on the Internet and see who is funding the campaigns for federally elected officials. Because doctors are expected to look out for the health and well-being of their patients, shouldn't we hold doctors to similar standards?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, some of this is already occurring. Minnesota requires drug companies to report any payments they give to doctors in that State. I think that is a good thing. Apparently, so do the citizens of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think what we really need is a national program that will require all drug companies to report when they make payments to doctors. I don't think it would be all that hard for those companies to do. After all, companies have to make sure they know where every penny is going. So it should not be that hard to report some of it to the Federal Government and to the American people. Besides, they are already doing it in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I plan to continue my inquiry into drug company payments to doctors. In addition, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as members of the pharmaceutical industry, to establish a national reporting system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 7 minutes, and if the Chair would notify me when I have used 6 minutes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak in favor of the Children's Health Insurance Program and its reauthorization, which is the legislation that is before us. We hear the numbers that 6 million children benefit from the program today--over 6 million--and this will provide for an additional 3 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want my colleagues to know that each one of these people are people, they are families, and they are affected by what we do here today. I take this time to acquaint my colleagues to Deamonte Driver. He was a 12-year-old who didn't live far from here--6 miles from here--in Prince Georges County, MD. He had a tooth problem. His mother tried to get him help. He had no insurance, and he fell through the cracks. He had a brother, Dashawn Driver, who had six decaying teeth. They tried to get help  for him. The mother thought the older brother was in worse shape than Deamonte. He started having headaches and was rushed to the emergency room. They found out his problem--he could not get to a dentist--was an abscessed tooth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before this, a social worker made 20 phone calls in an effort to try to get dental care for the Driver family, without success. They could not find a dentist willing to treat someone without insurance or in the Medicaid system. Deamonte ended up needing emergency surgery, which cost $250,000, and he ended up losing his life because the system did not provide care for a 12-year-old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we can certainly do better than that. Dr. Koop, a former Surgeon General of the United States, said, "There is no health care without oral health." Medical research has shown the linkage between plaque and heart disease. We know now that gum disease can be a signal of diabetes or a liver ailment or a hormone imbalance. We have to do better than we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dental disease is the most common childhood ailment in the United States to date. One out of five children between the ages of 2 to 4 will have some form of decaying teeth. By the time they reach 15, three out of five will have tooth decay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an imbalance as far as the racial effects. Racial minorities are much more likely to sustain untreated tooth decay. Forty percent of African-American children have untreated tooth decay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, Senator Bingaman, for his leadership on these issues and for introducing legislation and moving forward to try to provide better oral health care for children. I thank Senator Snowe for her leadership. I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for including initiatives in the legislation that is before us that will help the States meet this challenge--the $200 million included in the bill. That will have a major impact to try to help  American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an important opportunity before us in the legislation that we are considering to help our children,  not only to continue the benefits for 6.6 million children but so that we can add another 3 million out of the 9 million who currently have no health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to do more, but this is our opportunity today, and we have to take advantage of it. Our health care system is in crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week, I introduced the Universal Health Coverage Act, which would require everybody in this country to have health insurance. I think it is essential that we address the major problems in our country of so many people being without health insurance. We should start with the children, and we can do that with the legislation that is before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is that important? Well, we know that children who are enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program or have insurance are much more likely to get primary health care. They won't use the emergency rooms as much. If you don't have insurance, you have no choice but to go to the emergency room. We have improved health care outcomes if the child has health insurance. We know they are much more likely to have immunization and primary health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to comment that--again, talking about families and individuals--the Finance Committee held a hearing on the Children's Health Insurance Program. The Bedford family from my city of Baltimore came down here and testified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Bedford said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We no longer have to decide whether a child is really sick enough to warrant a doctor's visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bedford family enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program in Maryland. The program is working. Without this legislation, we will have to reimpose freezes on enrollments and people will lose coverage. It happened  in my State. This is a bipartisan bill, and I compliment my colleagues for bringing forward a bill that we can get enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Maryland, we started a program on July 1, 1998. About 38,000 children were enrolled at first, and we are up to 101,000 children enrolled today. Maryland will get an increase in this bill from $67 million to $189 million. We will be able to enroll 42,000 more children in the State of Maryland. It is an important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also compliment the committee for including outreach so that we can reach families who don't know how to enroll, or whether they are qualified to enroll, so we can get more families and children enrolled in the children's health care program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take advantage of the opportunity that we currently have before us. This is an opportunity in which we can make major progress in dealing with those children in our community who will either lose their coverage because we take no action, and those who currently have no insurance whom we can get enrolled in this program. It is a valuable program. We have an opportunity to move forward. So I urge my colleagues to support the fine effort of the Senate Finance  Committee in bringing forward this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="ETHICS AND LOBBYING REFORM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to say I am proud, very proud. I came to Washington hoping that we could make a difference in terms of the way business is done here. And I will be honest, I had some moments of doubt over the last 6 months. There were times that I wandered around the floor of the Senate, and even among my own party and the other party, and I heard kind of a murmuring of discontent over the ethics reform that we passed back in January. I got nervous that we  weren't serious about it, that we really weren't going to push the kind of cleansing of things that we have done in the legislation before us on which we are about to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't hard, what we are doing. We are trying to live like everybody else in America. Most Americans don't have a corporation they can call for a ride on a jet plane. Most Americans don't have somebody who wants to pay for a fancy trip. Most Americans really don't have the ability to decide that one group in their State gets money when others don't. But we did here. That was wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am so proud of this legislation. Is it perfect? No. I will wait--probably in vain--for that piece of legislation that we pass that is perfect. But because of our process, because of the glorious nature of a democracy, it is always a matter of give and take, always a matter of finding compromise to find that piece of legislation that can get enough votes so that we can send it to the President's desk. That is what this process was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have some friends--and, frankly, some people I agree with--on the other side of the aisle who are unhappy with some of the provisions in this bill. They are willing to look at the bundling provisions, the ban on travel and gifts, and the ban on corporate jets. They are willing to overlook the revolving door reforms--reforms in terms of sneaking provisions into conference bills without them ever being in either piece of legislation in the House and Senate, and focus in on just the inadequacies  of the earmark reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, would I have liked it to be a 67-vote point of order rather than a 60-vote point of order? Yes, I would have. Would I have wished for a system maybe that was even more transparent? Yes. But this is major reform. I will tell you that there are a few Senators who do not participate in the earmarking process, and I am not here to pat them or myself on the back for the fact that we do not do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say I think it is interesting that the phrase "the fox in the henhouse" was used as to the provisions in this bill. You know, there is a saying, "all hat and no cattle." Well, I think that maybe this is the time to use the phrase "all foxes and no hens," because if you step back from this issue of earmark reform, it is not complicated. It is pretty easy. As one of the cartoons said, "We have met the enemy and it is us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All we have to do to achieve the transparency that we need is for every Senator to put every earmark request that they are making on their Web site. I will say it again. All we have to do is have every Senator put every earmark request they are making on their own Web site. And then it won't be hard to make sure that the chairman of the committee or the majority floor leader have, in fact, certified all of the earmarks. I am a little offended that there is some assumption that these chairmen  and the majority leader would go out of their way to not tell the public there is a congressionally directed expenditure in the bill and will try to hide it. They are going to be caught if they do that. It is going to become public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then you will have the kind of accountability that really works around here. So I was disappointed when I heard that one of the Members of the other Chamber said he thought he could put earmarks in this conference report because we needed to vet it. It is not our job to vet them. It is not the Parliamentarian's job. They don't have the staff to do this. That is the job of the people of the United States because, guess what. It is their money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a strong ethics bill. Even though I was a cosponsor along with the Senators who spoke against this on the earmark reform, I want to say this goes a long way in the right direction. It is a great effort. I am proud of Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein, Senator Feingold, Senator Obama, and all of the other Senators who worked on this bill, and many on the Republican side have as well. I think we are going to pass it by a big number today. It is a moment  we should all be proud of, an accomplishment we should herald, and we should remember that if we are worried about foxes, we ought to check in our own closet for that fox outfit before we start pointing the finger at anybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
