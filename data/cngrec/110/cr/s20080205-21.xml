  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let Senators be aware that we Senators must and should address one another in the third person. There is a reason for this: It minimizes the chances of us having on display bad tempers. Are Senators aware that Senators should address one another--how? Not in the second person but, rather, in the third person? Is the Senator from Timbuktu aware of that  rule? Is the Senator from West Virginia aware of the rule? Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from West Virginia will take his seat. I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
