  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Chemical Facility Security Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that this act will improve upon the current legislation authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to regulate security practices at the Nation's chemical facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 5, 2006, <bill type="h" number="5441">H.R. 5441</bill>, FY07 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act became law (P.L. 109-295). Section 550 of that bill granted the Department of Homeland Security the authority to promulgate interim regulations for chemical facility security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although not required for interim regulations, the Department put out an Advance Notice of Rulemaking and requested public comments. Parts of the proposed regulations caused concern, prompting comments from myself and several of my colleagues in Congress. The intention of this bill is to address four areas of concern: Preemption of State laws, use of specific security measures, information protection, and private rights of action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most concerning piece of the proposed regulation occurred when the Department decided to go far beyond congressional intent and assert the right of the Secretary to preempt any State or local law; <bill type="h" number="5441">H.R. 5441</bill> was silent on the issue of preemption of State laws, and other major chemical security legislation considered in the 109th Congress--specifically <bill type="h" number="5695">H.R. 5695</bill> and <bill type="s" number="2145">S. 2145</bill>--protected State laws from preemption in most cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will protect State laws by allowing no Federal funds to be used to approve a site security plan unless the facility meets or exceeds security standards established by the State or local government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5441">H.R. 5441</bill> restricted the Secretary from requiring the use of any particular security measure. The use of specific security measures could, however, prove necessary to lower the risk posed to and by the chemical facility in certain cases. This bill removes this restriction and would allow the Secretary to require the use of specific security measures where necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the proposed regulations, the Department seeks to create a new class of security information called Chemical-Terrorism Vulnerability Information (CVI). The creation of new classes of protected information is not desirable, and this bill would require Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans to be treated as Sensitive Security Information (SSI). SSI is the same information classification currently used for Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans required by the  Coast Guard under the Maritime Transportation Security Act, under which chemical facilities located at ports are currently regulated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5441">H.R. 5441</bill> also restricted the right of a private citizen to sue a facility or the Department to force the facility to adopt and enforce the security measures. I feel that private suits are sometimes necessary to force a Federal agency to enforce regulations passed by Congress. Given the proliferation of signing statements made by President Bush in the past, we should not assume that congressional intent will be automatically followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regulations that preclude American citizens from access to judicial action run counter to our values. We should be empowering the citizens of this country to help protect the homeland, not restricting them from doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
