    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express some thoughts about the earlier statement of the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, that he was not going to attempt to bring this bill up for a vote this week. I think that is the only right choice that could have been made. He has been talking about bringing it up this week and actually getting a vote on Friday on a bill that we only got the paperwork on Saturday morning at 2 a.m. It hasn't been substituted yet, to my knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a piece of legislation of enormous complexity which has not gone through the proper committee--the Judiciary Committee. It was written by a group of people who claim they have reached an agreement. The agreement is that on both sides, they are saying nobody can offer an amendment that goes to what they consider the core of it because they will all band together and vote against it. So I guess that means if anybody has a different view about how immigration should be handled, the people  I really love and respect, whom I affectionately call "masters of the universe," are just going to all get together and vote no. So I am not sure what the purpose of having votes is. But presumably, the rest of us, now that we have had a chance to read it, will be able to at least nibble around the edges and offer a few amendments that might make it a little better, and I look forward to that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is very important that this bill was not rammed through this week and no attempt was made to do that. I think it would have poisoned the atmosphere. It would have been a very bad scene had that occurred. So now we are talking about 2 weeks of debate. There is no doubt in my mind that this Senate could spend a month easily on this bill--maybe more. It is a critically important piece of legislation. It has much impact on our whole economy, our culture, and our rule of law. We could do  better with it if we spend time on it. So I hope we are not in a situation where the leadership--the conferee group which has been meeting--is going to lock together and just vote down anything that displeases them or one side or the other says this is important and shouldn't be amended. So I am worried about that. We will see how it goes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the American people will take the opportunity to study the legislation. It does have some good things in it. It does have provisions in it that are quite superior to the bill I referred to as fatally flawed last year. But the cloture vote we just took was to move to last year's bill, and unless I am mistaken, we have not seen the new bill that is supposed to be substituted. We haven't seen anything other than a draft of the former bill. It has not been put in legislative language, even  in the smaller print in the draft version that has been floated since Saturday. It is 326 pages, but in normal bill language, it will turn out to be probably 800, maybe 1,000 pages with each one of the clauses and phrases. Based on our history of dealing with immigration,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of people wanted to ram this through before the Memorial Day recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad Senator Reid has abandoned that and will allow the American people the opportunity to have an extra week to look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues who have worked on the bill. They are good people. They have it in their heads that they want to fix immigration, and it is time for a comprehensive fix of immigration. There are tough decisions to be made. But I get a little bit worried when time after time I hear people say: Well, there is a lot in it I don't like,  but you know, you just have to live with it. I am not sure we ought to live with anything that doesn't make sense.  I am not sure we ought to live with anything that is bad policy. Why do we have to do that? Because this group has met and they said no serious amendments can be changed--adopted that would alter the core of the bill, the basic philosophy of it, I worry about that. We are troubled that a number of things don't quite reach the promised principles that have been floated as part of this discussion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trigger is in the bill, but I think it is far too weak. The temporary guest worker program is preferable to last year's, but it is very unsettling to me. I have an odd feeling that this temporary worker program that is in the bill is not going to work. We should not pass anything that won't work. It needs to be done in a better way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hoped-for move to a more merit-based system, a point system like Canada does, is troubling because no significant move in that direction appears to be on the horizon for 8 years. It is 8 years before the point system will really take effect. So I am worried about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are fundamental. Will the workplace system be effective? We need to study that language because if it is not done right, it won't work. I will have an opportunity to talk more about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my staff and a lot of other staff who have worked their hearts out Saturday, Sunday, and into the night last night and all morning today, trying to read and digest this bill to see what it really means so we can do a better job of serving our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the guiding principle, the overarching goal of an immigration bill, must be to serve the national interest. It is not to serve special interests, groups of special interests, businesses, or immigration advocacy groups. It is to serve the national interests, and that means a principled approach that creates a lawful system that serves our economy and our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
