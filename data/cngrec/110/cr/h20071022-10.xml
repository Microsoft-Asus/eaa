  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate our colleague, Bobby Jindal, who on Saturday was elected to serve as the  next Governor for the State of Louisiana. Republican Governor-elect Jindal successfully defeated 11 opponents to become the youngest sitting Governor in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The son of immigrants, Bobby has built a reputation as a hard worker and dedicated public servant. As a fellow Member of Congress, I have had the opportunity to work with Bobby. I know from his representation here in Washington and his years of service to the citizens of his State that the people of Louisiana have elected a strong leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate Bobby; his wife, Supriya; his dedicated staff; and his entire family for this wonderful victory. As Republican cochair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans and a strong supporter of the Indian American community, I am grateful for Bobby's success and praise him for being the first Indian-American Governor in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
