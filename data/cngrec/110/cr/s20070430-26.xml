    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a distinguished law enforcement officer for her service and dedication to our Nation. After nearly 24 years, Ms. Rachel R. Klay recently retired as a special agent with the U.S. Secret Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agent Klay was born in Orange City, IA, which, I might add, is just across the border from my home State of South Dakota. After graduating from Northwestern College in Orange City, she then went on to graduate school at Sangamon State University in Springfield, IL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 6, 1983, Rachel was sworn in as a Special Agent with the United States Secret Service and assigned to the Chicago Field Office, where she served with distinction for 4 years. During the course of her career, Agent Klay also served at the Secret Service's Western Protective Division, the Washington Field Office, the Presidential Protective Division, the Liaison Division, and the Investigative Support Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1999 to 2002, she worked as a Resident Agent in Sioux Falls, SD. She then served in the Secret Service's Liaison Division before retiring earlier this year to take employment at the Federal Reserve Board as a Senior Special Agent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past decade, I have had the pleasure of getting to know Agent Klay and have had the opportunity to see her in action, both in South Dakota and here in Washington, DC. While always quick with a smile and a friendly demeanor, she also exuded the professionalism, confidence, and courage associated with the tremendous responsibilities she bore as a Special Agent with the Secret Service. Simply put, our country is better, stronger, and safer because of her service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important and fitting that we as Americans recognize the invaluable contribution made every day by law enforcement officers such as Agent Klay. These dedicated professionals put their lives on the line to investigate crimes and protect us and our families. Law enforcement officers such as Agent Klay are the ones who stand guard and preserve our safety. Their tireless efforts, personal sacrifices, and dedication to the rule of law are an example of what is right and good about our country  and those who serve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is therefore my honor and privilege to pay tribute today to the distinguished career and record of accomplishment provided by Special Agent Rachel Klay. Through her service, she has added to the reputation of integrity and valor of the United States Secret Service, and in doing so has provided an invaluable service to our Nation. On behalf of South Dakota and a grateful nation, I thank Agent Klay for her service and wish her all the best in this new chapter in her life and career.</paragraph>
