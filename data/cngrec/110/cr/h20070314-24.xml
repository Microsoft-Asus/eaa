  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Halliburton has decided to move its headquarters to Dubai. This is a company that has received over $25 billion worth  of contracts in Iraq, and this is the kind of thanks the U.S. taxpayers get. In fact, this is a real slap in the face of the U.S. taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ABC National News reported Sunday night that Halliburton has been charged by government inspectors of overcharging our government and overcharging our taxpayers to the tune of $2.7 billion. No company that commits those types of overcharges should ever get a Federal contract again. In fact, in my opinion, the U.S. Government should not give a contract to any company that cannot certify that over half of its employees are U.S. citizens.</paragraph>
