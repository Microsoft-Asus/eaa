  <narrative>U.S. CHARITIES HELP HAMAS -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8814]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it seems the terrorist group Hamas may have been receiving money from a U.S.-based fake charity organization that funds Hamas's reigns of terror in the Middle East, all under the hypocritical name of compassion and goodwill. A Dallas, Texas, Muslim charity has been charged with pouring millions of dollars into a terrorist slush fund that is bent on destroying Israel and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the charity denies any wrongdoing, of course, prosecutors say money went straight to Hamas and some of the money went to aid families of suicide bombers. But this self-righteous "charity" says they are innocent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The charity claims they were sending money for humanitarian efforts in Palestine. Madam Speaker, the fanatical terrorist group Hamas is not a humanitarian organization. They kill humanitarians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If nonprofit organizations in the United States are aiding terrorist organizations in their devastation, destruction, and death, they should be held accountable. If this charity is a fraud, then the money should be confiscated and given to victims of terrorism. And then the charity organizers ought to go to jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
