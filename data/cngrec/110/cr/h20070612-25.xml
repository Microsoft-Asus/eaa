  <speaking speaker="412199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have been working in a bipartisan manner to approve important legislation which will have a real impact on the lives of hardworking American families. Unfortunately, President Bush has expressed his opposition to a majority of the bipartisan legislation we have passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Congress sent the President a stem cell research bill that would provide hope for millions of Americans suffering from diseases like cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's. The final bill promotes lifesaving embryonic stem cell research by increasing the number of stem lines that are eligible to be used for federally funded research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope the President would not stand in the way of real medical progress and would reconsider his veto threat to this vitally important legislation. The President also opposes legislation passed by the House that would make prescription drugs more affordable for America's seniors. And he also opposes legislation making more affordable student loans for America's teenagers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress cannot move this Nation in a new direction on its own. It's time for the President to join us, creating a meaningful change for the American people.</paragraph>
