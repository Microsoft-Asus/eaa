  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, 7,000 Minnesotans stood on the steps of the St. Paul capitol in our State for the purpose of standing for freedom. It was a beautiful, sunny, ebullient Saturday morning, and 7,000 hardworking Minnesotans took their time away from their families and away from their work to stand on the steps of our State capitol to say: Enough is enough, stop raising my taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last vote I took in this body prior to our recess had the Democrats calling for the largest tax increase in American history and the largest spending increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people in Minnesota, Mr. Speaker, asked me to come back to this body to fight for their freedom and to fight for the ability to hold on to more of their hardworking income, and that is exactly what we intend to do.</paragraph>
