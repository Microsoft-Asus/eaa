    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend Women's Lunch Place in Boston, MA for 25 years of dedicated service to women in need in the Boston area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The persistence of homelessness in our State has long been a focus of concern and attention for many of us in Boston and throughout our Commonwealth. Homeless persons each have their own story of their unique circumstances, but they teach us the same lesson--that we must deal more effectively with the causes of homelessness, such as drug abuse, poverty, domestic violence, mental illness, and the lack of basic skills and adequate education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the members of Women's Lunch Place and its supporters take well-deserved pride in the outstanding work they have done over the past 25 years in providing needed assistance for the countless numbers of women who have walked through its doors. They have made a remarkable difference in the lives of those they have touched so deeply, and all of us in Massachusetts are proud of their achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The strong commitment of Women's Lunch Place has enabled these women to embark on a new life and equipped them with the support of a community and a newfound optimism for their future. As it continues its mission and its ever-expanding possibilities in the years ahead, I commend Women's Lunch Place for all it does so well.</paragraph>
