    <paragraph>Freedom of speech is one of the country's most cherished values. Nothing sets us farther apart from the countries and regimes we oppose than our belief that everyone's opinion matters--everyone's--and that everyone has a right to express it. That is why when we hear things on the radio and other places that are offensive, by and large we tolerate them. But last week Rush Limbaugh went way over the line. While I respect his right to say anything he likes, his unpatriotic comments cannot  be ignored. During his show last Wednesday, Limbaugh was engaged in one of his typical rants. This one was unremarkable and indistinguishable from his usual dribble which has been steadily losing listeners for years, until he crossed that line by calling our men and women in uniform</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been debating the Iraq war in the Senate and throughout the country, not for months but for years. There are good, patriotic Americans who favor the war and good, patriotic Americans who oppose President  Bush's first getting us into war and the way he has handled the war. Neither party holds a patent on patriotism. I know all of my Republican colleagues would agree with this, or at least I hope so. Yet Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack  the courage and character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us. Rush Limbaugh got himself a deferment from serving when he was a young man. He never served in uniform. He never saw a person in the extreme difficulty of maintaining peace in a foreign country engaged in civil war. He never saw a person in combat. Yet he thinks</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past Friday, many Democrats joined me in drafting a letter to the chief executive officer of Clear Channel, Mark Mays, that we will send out this week. Here is what we wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. Mays, At the time we sign this letter, 3,801 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq, and another 27,936 have been wounded. 160,000 others awoke this morning on foreign sand, far from home, to face the danger and uncertainty of another day at war. Although Americans of goodwill debate the merits of this war, we can all agree that those who serve with such great courage deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. That is why Rush Limbaugh's recent characterization of troops who oppose  the war as "phony soldiers" is such an outrage. Our troops are fighting and dying to bring to others the freedoms that many take for granted. It is unconscionable that Mr. Limbaugh would criticize them for exercising the fundamentally American right to free speech. Mr. Limbaugh has made outrageous remarks before, but this affront to our soldiers is beyond the pale. The military, like any community within the United States, includes members both for and against the war. Senior generals, such as General John Batiste and Paul Eaton, have come out against the war while others have publicly supported it. A December 2006 poll conducted by the Military Times found just 35 percent of service members approved of President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq, compared to 42 percent who disapproved. From this figure alone, it is clear</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as patriotism is the exclusive realm of neither party, taking a stand against those who spew hate and impugn the integrity of our troops is a job that belongs to both parties. I can't help but wonder how my Republican colleagues would have reacted if the tables were turned--if a well-known Democratic radio personality had used the same insulting line of attack against troops who support the war. The letter I read will be available on the Senate floor all day. During the votes, after the  votes, colleagues on both sides of the aisle will have every chance to add their names to it. I encourage all to do so. If we take the Republican side at their word that last week's vote on another controversial statement related to the war was truly about patriotism, not politics, then I have no doubt they will stand with us against Limbaugh's comments with equal fervor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident we will see Republicans join with us in overwhelming numbers. "Confident" is the wrong word. "Hopeful" is the right word. I am hopeful we will see Republicans join with us in overwhelming numbers. Anything less would be a double standard that has no place in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to join together against this irresponsible, hateful, and unpatriotic attack by calling upon Rush Limbaugh to give our troops the apology they deserve. I hope all will sign this letter.</paragraph>
