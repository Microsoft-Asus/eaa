  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas 40,000 people in the United States, and 1,200,000 people globally, die in road crashes each year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas another 20,000,000 to 50,000,000 people globally are injured each year as a result of speeding motor vehicles, the increasing use of motor vehicles, and rapid urbanization;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the World Health Organization has predicted that by the year 2020 the annual number of deaths from motor vehicle crashes is likely to surpass the annual number of deaths from AIDS;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the current estimated cost of motor vehicle crashes worldwide is $518,000,000,000 annually, representing between 3 and 5 percent of the gross domestic product of each nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas over 90 percent of motor vehicle-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, motor vehicle-related deaths and costs continue to rise in these countries due to a lack of appropriate road engineering and injury prevention programs in public health sectors; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution designating the third Sunday of November as a day of remembrance for road crash victims and their families, and called on nations globally to improve road safety: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals of a world day of remembrance for road crash victims; and</chair>
  <chair> (2) encourages the people of the United States to commemorate a world day of remembrance for road crash victims with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other activities.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

  <chair>The joint resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>
    <bill type="sj" number="17">S.J. Res. 17</bill>
  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas the decline of several commercially valuable fish stocks throughout the world's oceans highlights the need for fishing nations to conserve fish stocks and develop management systems that promote fisheries sustainability;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas fish stocks are migratory throughout their habitats, and changing ocean conditions can restructure marine habitats and redistribute the species dependent on those habitats;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas changing global climate regimes may increase ocean water temperature, creating suitable new habitats in areas previously too cold to support certain fish stocks, such as the Arctic Ocean;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas habitat expansion and migration of fish stocks into the Arctic Ocean and the potential for vessel docking and navigation in the Arctic Ocean could create conditions favorable for establishing and expanding commercial fisheries in the future;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas commercial fishing has occurred in several regions of the Arctic Ocean, including the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Greenland Sea, although fisheries scientists have only limited data on current and projected future fish stock abundance and distribution patterns throughout the Arctic Ocean;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas remote indigenous communities in all nations that border the Arctic Ocean engage in limited, small scale subsistence fishing and must maintain access to and sustainability of this fishing in order to survive;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas many of these communities depend on a variety of other marine life for social, cultural and subsistence purposes, including marine mammals and seabirds that may be adversely affected by climate change, and emerging fisheries in the Arctic should take into account the social, economic, cultural and subsistence needs of these small coastal communities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas managing for fisheries sustainability requires that all commercial fishing be conducted in accordance with science-based limits on harvest, timely and accurate reporting of catch data, equitable allocation and access systems, and effective monitoring and enforcement systems;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas migratory fish stocks traverse international boundaries between the exclusive economic zones of fishing nations and the high seas, and ensuring sustainability of fisheries targeting these stocks requires management systems based on international coordination and cooperation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas international fishing treaties and agreements provide a framework for establishing rules to guide sustainable fishing activities among those nations that are parties to the agreement, and regional fisheries management organizations provide international fora for implementing these agreements and facilitating international cooperation and collaboration;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas under its authorities in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council has proposed that the United States close all Federal waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to commercial fishing until a fisheries management plan is fully developed; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas future commercial fishing and fisheries management activities in the Arctic Ocean should be developed through a coordinated international framework, as provided by international treaties or regional fisheries management organizations, and this framework should be implemented before significant commercial fishing activity expands to the high seas: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the United States should initiate international discussions and take necessary steps with other Arctic nations to negotiate an agreement or agreements for managing migratory, transboundary, and straddling fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean and establishing a new international fisheries management organization or organizations for the region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the agreement or agreements negotiated pursuant to paragraph (1) should conform to the requirements of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and contain mechanisms, inter alia, for establishing catch and bycatch limits, harvest allocations, observers, monitoring, data collection and reporting, enforcement, and other elements necessary for sustaining future Arctic fish stocks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) as international fisheries agreements are negotiated and implemented, the United States should consult with the North Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and Alaska Native subsistence communities of the Arctic; and</chair>
  <chair> (4) until the agreement or agreements negotiated pursuant to paragraph (1) come into force and measures consistent with the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement are in effect, the United States should support international efforts to halt the expansion of commercial fishing activities in the high seas of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</chair>
