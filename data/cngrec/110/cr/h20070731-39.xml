  <narrative>PASS PENDING TRADE AGREEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9191]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. GOODLATTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass several pending trade agreements. I believe in the benefits of free and fair trade. I support efforts to open foreign markets to American goods and services whenever possible because such efforts lead to increased economic growth for the Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With approximately one in every four jobs in my congressional district being tied to trade, the expansion of trade means a healthy future for a number of local businesses, and in turn, new jobs for my district and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is disappointing that the Democratic majority has not embraced these trade agreements, as they would mean new jobs for citizens across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I remain committed to the benefits of free and fair trade, and I urge this House to take action on these agreements.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
