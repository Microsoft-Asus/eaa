    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize Flowers Foods of Thomasville, GA, which has just been named by Forbes magazine as this year's "Best-Managed" publicly traded food company. This honor comes on top of a record fourth quarter and a record year for Flowers Foods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Flowers Foods has clearly set a standard of excellence for which all of us should strive. Operating out of Thomasville, GA, since 1919, Flowers Foods has a proven record of success and dedication not only to its customers and employees but also to the State of Georgia. I have watched as this company has grown over the years to the point where it now serves almost 40 percent of the U.S. population. I expect its continued success to serve as a shining example to businesses across Georgia and the  United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend chief executive officer George E. Deese and all the employees of Flowers Foods and their families on a job well done.</paragraph>
