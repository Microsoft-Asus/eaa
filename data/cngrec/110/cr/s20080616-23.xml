    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize the community of Corona, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. Corona is a rural community located in Roberts County, and will be celebrating its quasquicentennial the weekend of June 20-22 with a street dance, a 5k walk/run, hot air balloon rides, a parade, and fireworks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1881, a town site called Prior was plotted approximately 1 1/2  miles north of the future site of Corona, named for its owner, C. H. Prior. Prior was the original stopping point for the postal service until moving to the present location of Corona in 1883, which provided closer access to the railroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The early business district of Corona was comprised of a doctor, a newspaper, two banks, four grocery stores, a butcher shop, a post office, four grain elevators, a general store, a hardware store, a creamery, and two lumber yards. Main Street was marked with hitching posts, gasoline lights, and wooden sidewalks that were notorious for their hazardous conditions when wet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Corona still boasts several businesses including a caf&#xE9;, a post office, a grain elevator, and most importantly, the Corona Learning Center. Three industrial enterprises are also based in the area: Mark's Custom Woodworking, Ammann Honey Farm, and Dakota Machine Works. Despite the hardworking nature of Corona's inhabitants, they still manage to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with one of the longest parades in the State, whether rain, snow, or shine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most South Dakotans call small towns like Corona home. South Dakota's small communities are the bedrock of our economy and vital to the future of our State. It is especially because of our small communities, and the feelings of loyalty and familiarity that they engender, that I am proud to call South Dakota home. Towns like Corona and its citizens are no different and truly know what it means to be a South Dakotan. Even 125 years after its founding, Corona continues to be a vibrant addition to  our wonderful State, and I once again congratulate them on this achievement.</paragraph>
