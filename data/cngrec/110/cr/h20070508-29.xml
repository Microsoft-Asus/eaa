  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has now been 4 months since Democrats took control of Congress, and already we see a dramatic change in how business is done on Capitol Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To begin with, we restored the 5-day workweek so that actually we are addressing the people's business. Longer workweeks have led to more bills and resolutions being passed. In 2005 the previous Congress had only 72 bills up to this point. This year alone we have already passed 165. That is almost 100 bills more in this short 4-month period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also approved a budget for the upcoming fiscal year that significantly increases funding for veterans' health care, children's health care and education. And we do it all without raising taxes, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we've only been in charge now for 4 months, but we are already producing positive results for the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
