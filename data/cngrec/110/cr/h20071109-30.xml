    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge an historic victory that occurred over last weekend, when the United States Naval Academy football team, for the first time in 43 years, upset the University of Notre Dame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recognize the accomplishments of this Midshipmen football team, we also recognize the commitment that each middie has made to our country. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Midshipmen for their historic victory over the Fighting Irish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in this spirit that I submit further remarks for inclusion in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record as well as an editorial from the Baltimore Sun recognizing the extraordinary accomplishment of these young men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And also for the record, I would like to say, Go Navy. Beat Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the United States Naval Academy Football Team for Saturday's thrilling victory over the University of Notre Dame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Midshipmen defeated the Fighting Irish 46-44 in triple-overtime, marking the first Navy victory in the annual match-up since 1963.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A tradition since 1927, the Navy-Notre Dame series is the longest uninterrupted intersectional series in Division I college football. This year's installment of this great football rivalry was, for the first time, tied at the end of regulation and featured 90 combined points, the most ever in the 80-year-old series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Midshipmen victory in the third overtime snapped Notre Dame's 43-year win streak in harrowing fashion. Navy made what appeared to be its last stand against the Fighting Irish Offense, stopping a Notre Dame attempt at a two-point conversion to tie the game. A controversial pass interference call allowed Notre Dame one more chance to force a fourth overtime. It looked as though the streak was destined to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Midshipmen again held their ground and defeated Notre Dame. On this Saturday, the disadvantages that a service academy team has to overcome relative to its "Big Name" Division I competition did not matter. The Naval Academy does not have an exclusive television contract. Its recruiters cannot promise top-tier high school seniors access to a network of NFL scouts and alumni.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the United States Naval Academy beat the University of Notre Dame, a team of  young men celebrated an athletic victory that had escaped two generations of Midshipmen--two generations of Academy graduates who led our Navy and our country through the Cold War and into the twenty-first century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recognize the accomplishment of this Midshipmen Football team, we also recognize the commitment that each Middie has made to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Midshipmen for their historic victory over the Fighting Irish. It is in this spirit that I submit for inclusion in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD this editorial from the Baltimore Sun recognizing the extraordinary accomplishment of these young men. For the record, "Go Navy. Beat Army."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[From the Baltimore Sun, Nov. 6, 2007]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One for the Middies</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please forgive the irrepressible grins, the sunny outlook and the other outward signs of deep satisfaction displayed this week by fans of U.S. Naval Academy football. Navy's 46-44 triple-overtime victory over the Fighting Irish on Saturday in South Bend, Ind., was bound to have a lasting effect. Beating a rival once every 43 years will do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Notre Dame-Navy match-up is one of the more lopsided annual events in college football. One fields a team of high school all-Americans, the other with future Navy and Marine Corps officers. Unless Roger Staubach is behind center taking snaps (as he was for Navy in 1963), the results are generally predictable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the combination of a solid Navy team with a potent offense and postseason ambitions opposed by a Notre Dame squad mired in a losing season of record-setting proportions helped turn the unthinkable into the wonderful--at least from the Midshipmen's perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No doubt coach Paul Johnson will tell his players that this was just one victory and Navy needs more wins to get to another bowl game. And, of course, their fans will expect them to beat a certain military academy from the Hudson River Valley next month. No season would be complete without a win over West Point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, this is a moment to savor. Even a Notre Dame fan has to admit it's nice to see an underdog come out on top once in a while. Navy still needs a 60-year winning streak to even its career record against the Irish. That's not likely, but at least it doesn't seem quite as improbable today.</paragraph>
