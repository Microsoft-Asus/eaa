  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to speak for just a moment about the comments that Senator Specter made earlier about the process for considering the nomination of Eric Holder as Attorney General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican members of the Judiciary Committee have been seeking information and doing work to prepare for the hearing. But there is a great deal of information that is not yet available and a great deal of information that hasn't yet been reviewed, all to the point that it is going to take a little bit of time to prepare for the hearing in order to do it right. Of course, we want to do it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is absolutely no desire on anyone's part to slow a process down or filibuster or in any other way make it difficult for the orderly process to unfold for the confirmation of the nominee of the President, we do ask that we be accorded the same consideration that was given to others in this situation and that there be adequate time to confirm him. I see no reason, if he is qualified and if he is confirmed, that he could not take office very soon after the President himself takes office,  perhaps as early as a week or two after that. So nobody is talking about a long delay, but we do need to have adequate time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, since the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has indicated he would like to begin holding hearings on January 8, which is literally right after we begin the swearing in of the new Members and the beginning of the next session, there is not adequate time for the kinds of things that have to be done if that is the date that we meet. This has been conveyed to the chairman by Senator Specter. He has asked for a reasonable amount of time to get prepared. I hope that can be  accommodated. It is of sufficient concern that several of us have indicated, through a letter to the chairman, that we are going to insist on having adequate time for the consideration of his nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember the nomination of John Ashcroft who was a colleague of everyone here, a Senator from Missouri, when he was nominated to become the Attorney General; nevertheless, it took 4 days of hearings for the Senate to decide to confirm him. His hearings began on Tuesday, January 16. As I said, they lasted for 4 days. The chairman of the committee has, as I said, indicated that the Holder hearings would be scheduled for January 8, more than a week earlier. I don't think that is adequate for the  things we have to do. Ashcroft was voted on by the full committee on January 30. He was confirmed on February 1. So that timing certainly would be totally appropriate for nominee Holder and would not in any way delay the administration with respect to the office of the Attorney General. In fact, irony of ironies, because Senator Ashcroft was not confirmed until February 1, Eric Holder himself, who was in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, we don't even have Eric Holder's questionnaire or FBI background investigation, all of which are necessary to prepare for the hearing.  Senator Specter noted that we currently have 86 boxes of archived committee documents relating to Mr. Holder's tenure at the Justice Department to review. There are additional documents that have been sought from the Department of Justice and the Clinton library which would provide additional information  that we will need to examine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One might say this is a lot of work to do for a nominee. Bear in mind, this is the Attorney General of the United States, an individual who has some controversy in his past. I don't know whether this controversy is sufficient to suggest that he should not be confirmed, but that is what the investigation and hearings, of course, are all about. We are familiar with what these items are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Holder was involved in the pardons of members of the FALN organization by President Clinton, the pardons of Marc Rich, Pincus Green, Susan Rosenberg, and Linda Sue Evans. He was also involved in a controversial raid in Miami by the Border Patrol action to take Elian Gonzales into custody. He was involved in death penalty approvals, rejections, or disputes. One that troubles me--and I want to get to the bottom of this--was the decision of the Department of Justice not to defend the power of  Congress to enact a particular statute, 18 U.S.C 3501. There was Supreme Court litigation called Dickerson v. United States, including Department of Justice responses to Judiciary Committee inquiries on the subject and views of U.S. attorneys and Department advisory panels on the matter. The case involved</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know whether any of those controversial matters are enough to reject the nominee, but they are well known, controversial, and I think we have an obligation to look into all of these matters. I am not alone. Richard Cohen wrote in the Washington Post that Eric Holder should not be the Attorney General. I don't know whether he is right or not, but the questions he raises need to be examined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glenn Greenwald wrote in the Salon magazine that Holder's involvement with the Rich pardon was "substantial, continuous, and concerted, much, much more than `peripheral,' " which is the way Holder himself described it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final note. In addition to having plenty of time to review and prepare and review documents and the FBI interviews and background checks of Eric Holder and prepare for his hearings, we will want to have sufficient time also to carefully consider other top Department of Justice nominees, such as the Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, Solicitor General, and the heads of the Office of Legal Counsel, the Criminal Division, the Civil Rights Division, and the National Security  Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope if we set the right precedent with the Attorney General himself, these other matters will be considered in due time and we won't have to argue each time there is an insufficient opportunity to conduct the kind of examination that would be necessary for positions as important as these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope our colleague, the chairman of the committee, will reconsider his initial decision to schedule the hearings on January 8. If we can move those back even a week, that would provide time for us to conduct the process properly. We are not asking for some outrageous delay just for the sake of delay. I hope he can accommodate us, and knowing of the views of the other members of the committee on the Republican side, that he would be willing to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a moment ago I had the honor of presiding before the distinguished Senator from Florida replaced me in the chair, and I was presiding during the time the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, came to the floor to discuss the timing of the nomination proceedings for the President-elect's candidate for Attorney General, Eric Holder. I had the chance to hear the points that they made, and  I wish, just briefly, to respond to a few of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the junior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am certainly in no position to speak for the chairman. Obviously we heard Senator Kyl ask that the timing be done on a reasonable basis, and I think Senator Leahy, the very distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is nothing if not reasonable and has shown enormous reasonableness with the timing of all the nominees that have come before him. And I would expect this to be no different. But in evaluating the reasonableness  of the schedule that the chairman has proposed, or, I should say, announced, it may be worth putting it into the context of the history of these sorts of nominees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you go all the way back to President Carter, for more than 30 years, whether the Senate was controlled by Republicans or Democrats, or the President was a Republican or a Democrat, we have had nominees for Attorney General come through the process. And throughout that long span of time, the average time between the announcement by the President of his choice for Attorney General and the nomination hearing, the average amount of time has been 29 days. And the average amount of time until a  committee vote has been 37 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is the background. If you average over 30 years, from the announcement, 29 days to the hearing, 37 days to the vote. The schedule that Chairman Leahy has proposed is 39 days to the hearing, and he hopes for 50 days to the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So instead of the average that it has been over 30 years of 29 days, the Republicans have 10 extra days beyond the average to do the work that they assert that they need to do, and the vote may not come for 50 days, which is 11 days longer than the average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think everyone in this body understands the importance of a new President having his new Attorney General in place quickly. The President is going to be sworn in on January 20, and I think it is in all our interests as Americans to make sure that his choice is honored in a reasonable timeframe so that when the President takes office, he has an intact team. Certainly with the Attorney General as such an important part of the President's national security team in this time of national security  concerns, he should have an intact team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so it seems to me that the average is a pretty reasonable place to start, and when the chairman has given an extra 10 days beyond the average just to the beginning of hearings, and hopefully an extra 13 days beyond the average for the vote, it's a pretty good signal that the chairman is being very reasonable about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, some of the Attorneys General whom we have seen, Attorney General Mukasey had a period of 30 days from his nomination to the start of the hearings. That was at President Bush's request. Remember, he indicated that he wanted to get him in place soon. The Department was in grave distress and we needed to act quickly. We acted in 30 days. We are acting here in 39 days, more than was given for Attorney General Mukasey. The vote hopefully will be the same as for Attorney General Mukasey:  50 days from the announcement to the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't sound unreasonable. Nobody said it was unreasonable when Attorney General Mukasey was put through that schedule. I don't see how it can be unreasonable that Eric Holder should have a more generous schedule, and somehow that is no longer reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Attorney General Ashcroft, it was 25 days to the hearing instead of 39; 39 days to the vote instead of the hoped-for 50. For Attorney General Reno, 26 days to the hearing instead of 39 days; 27 days to the vote instead of the hoped-for 50. Nearly twice as much time as for Attorney General Reno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think the point is pretty clear. It is the tradition and the history of  this body to honor the President's request to act quickly, and in terms of the reasonableness of the schedule that Chairman Leahy has proposed, he has proposed a schedule that is on the generous side of the average and of recent history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the concern that there is a lot to look at in Eric Holder's history, well, every lawyer who is experienced and active enough in the profession to be a candidate to be Attorney General of the United States has got a long history to look at. That is a given. That is a constant. That is not something that is different about Eric Holder than about any of his predecessors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, if anything, the opposite concern would be justified, which is that we have already had a lot of time to look at Eric Holder. First of all, he has an astonishingly distinguished record to be Attorney General. It is remarkable--his personal story, his career. It is all spectacular, truly. But specific to the question of nomination, this is a lawyer who came right after law school to the Department of Justice and served as a prosecutor for a decade prosecuting public corruption cases. So  he had to be cleared by the FBI to come in as a Department of Justice attorney, and he served there for all those 10 years. That is all a matter of clear public record. Everybody has had a chance to look at that forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next thing that happened, in 1988, Eric Holder was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the bench to serve as Superior Court judge in Washington, DC. Again, he was confirmed by the Senate. We had a full look of everything up to 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his service on the bench, Eric Holder was nominated by President Clinton to serve as the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. United States Attorney Holder and I were colleagues; me in Rhode Island, him down in DC. I went through that process of nomination and confirmation. It is exhaustive. It was done for him. He was confirmed at that time. So as of the date he was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, we had done a complete Senate look of his  record to that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that wasn't the last time. In 1997, President Clinton nominated United States Attorney Holder to serve as the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Attorney General Reno's No. 2 in that department. And he was then confirmed by this body, the Senate, unanimously. And, again, we had that full record of his before us at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a guy who has been the subject of very public attention as a public official, the Deputy Attorney General. There isn't a whole lot that one does as Deputy Attorney General that isn't available to the public, that isn't in the news media. This is not somebody who has come out of nowhere and who has a great, vast mysterious past history that we need to have a look at. Indeed, this body has had three looks at him, confirmed him three separate times. The most recent time as late as 1997,  unanimously. So I think the notion that--with only 1997 to now to look through, a period of a mere decade--the idea that he is being shoved unreasonably rapidly through the process, when he is substantially slower than the average, simply doesn't hold water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would urge my Republican colleagues--again, they can have discussions with the chairman that obviously are at a rank higher than mine--but I would urge my colleagues to consider their views in that context: in the context of a spectacularly qualified individual who has thrice been confirmed by this body, as recently as 1997, and who is being given more time for scrutiny than the average or the recent Bush appointees, and in an environment in which I think we can all agree that after the  Bush management of the Department of Justice, we badly need a new Attorney General in there and soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with those observations I will yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for waiting while I finished my remarks. I see the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma on the other side of the Chamber and I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.</chair>

    <paragraph>I ask to speak in morning business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague and his informed words. Much of what he has stated I agree with, but there is a significant difference. No. 1 is I was not in the Senate when Mr. Holder was confirmed. Given the facts that played out associated with pardons that President Clinton had, the look needs to be refreshed without any question because there is no question that Mr. Holder erred in his judgment and has essentially said so, in association with one Mr. Marc Rich, a fugitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not doubt Mr. Holder has a distinguished record. He is well qualified for lots of areas. I do not think it ought to be on the floor that we debate whether we have a hearing. But I can tell you that the information we have requested, both from the Clinton libraries and others, will not be available to us to peruse and to study. I may in fact in the long term end up voting for Mr. Holder, but I am not about to do anything less than a very thorough job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also remind my colleagues I was the first Republican Senator in the midst of the committee to call for the resignation of Attorney General Gonzales--rightly so. The position of Attorney General, although it is appointed by the President, is very different than all the rest of the appointments because he is for all of us, every citizen in this country, the chief law enforcement officer of this land. His loyalty is not to the President. His loyalty has to be to the Constitution. It has to be  to the responsible bodies that guide this country, although if we in fact have hearings early, we will have to have additional hearings. We will not allow a vote to occur until we have thoroughly, to each member of the Judiciary Committee's satisfaction, had the record examined and had the questions answered that are going to need to be answered with regard to some of the events that have taken place late in the Clinton administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not to cast any aspersions on Mr. Holder. I think he is a fine man. But judgment is the key thing that is most important and there is a red flag. So if it is insisted that we go early, earlier than we are prepared so we can truly ask the questions we think the country would need us to ask, then I think we will have a difficult time ever moving that nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That should not be the case. The fact is this gentleman deserves the best, the most thorough opportunity to explain himself in a way where people are asking proper questions, not improper questions. More important, the American people deserve for us to do our job. That means we have to be very well briefed, very well studied on the questions and circumstances about which we will apply them.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be happy to in a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have given positive comments to the press on Mr. Holder, so I am not necessarily someone in opposition. But I can tell you I am in opposition to not being in a position to do my job. It is going to be impossible, and I will tell my colleague that, with the schedule that has been set forth. I will not be able to be prepared at the time. I have one staff lawyer. For us to go through everything to my satisfaction, for me to fulfill my oath, that is not a possibility between now and January 9.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing I would say is much of the information we have requested is not even going to be available to us until January 6. So it would be terrible to start the next Congress off having a fight about a fight. My hope is we can come to a compromise so we all feel very well prepared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no intent to delay Mr. Holder's nomination. There is every intent to make sure we are prepared to thoroughly vet his qualifications of independence and judgment. It is not his qualifications as to whether he has the capability to fulfill the role. It is whether he will demonstrate the independence and the judgment with which to fulfill it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague knows--he was at the hearing when I asked the Attorney General to resign--I am not a partisan. The President-elect who nominated this man I have a great deal of respect for. But I am going to do my job. If it means holding up a nomination until I get all the answers, then that is what I  will do. So there is no reason for us to do that by not accommodating the ranking member on this committee and setting the schedule with which the minority  on that committee are not prepared to be prepared to answer that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I am happy to yield to my colleague.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that very much. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his courtesy for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to make sure the distinguished Senator was not suggesting that when the Senate allowed 26 days between Attorney General Reno's announcement and her nomination hearing, or allowed 25 days between Attorney General Ashcroft's announcement and his nomination hearing, or allowed 30 days between Attorney General Mukasey's announcement and his nomination hearing that the Senate was then underprepared or had not done its job in evaluating, or didn't have enough time to evaluate those candidates.  I think they probably did. They appeared to going forward. By comparison, the 39 days----</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I could finish the question----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>I suggest we did a poor job with Attorney General Gonzales, that is No. 1. No. 2, I was not here then so I don't know whether we did or did not. Mukasey--the difference that would lie is there is a large red flag on one or two specific actions of this gentleman as he acted as assistant Attorney General. That requires good scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I assure my colleague that does not mean, and I think he knows this--I have not made a decision on this gentleman and I will not until we have gone through the hearing process. As I have said to the press, I am generally inclined to think he is very well qualified for this. But the question of judgment will require a lot of research on associated issues that have been outlined here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, to me, it is not a game I am playing. I think my colleagues in the Senate know I work very hard to stay informed and up to detail on every issue that is before us. I would say to my colleague, to me, I don't care what the time was ever. What I care about is do we do it right so we do not have a repeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure my colleague knows he doesn't want us to have a repeat of making a mistake and not thoroughly vetting someone to the degree we should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is the Judiciary Committee in the next Congress operates very smoothly, that we stand on the principles that we spoke about as we went through this last year, and that we do not see the process of trying to slow down judicial appointments because it is a partisan issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has my pledge that will never be anything I will pertain to or participate in. If somebody is qualified and they are this President's nominee and they are qualified after going through the Judiciary Committee and I believe they should be voted on, I intend to vote for them and not hold them up. But I think this is a very different instance. There are two specific problems that have to be very well vetted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From what we have seen so far, the vast majority and minority have not met Mr. Holder. We are going to be asked to meet with him on the day before the committee hearing so we will not have had the time even after we meet with him to be able to cross-check what we have asked him against what facts we know because we will not have all the facts in, because we will not even have all the records from the Clinton library at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest we ought to start it off in more of a spirit of cooperation. My ranking member is of the learned opinion for the years that he has been here, and he is a proven expert in the law, that we need more time. We hope that request would be honored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wanted, while the Senator from Oklahoma is still on the floor, to let him know I appreciate his concern and I am grateful for his kind words. I would hope the one or two red flags that he has mentioned are not such as to justify necessarily extending the period between nomination and confirmation hearings more than 2 weeks beyond what the Senate gave for other nominees such as Attorney General Thornburgh, Attorney General Barr--almost 2 weeks for Attorney General Reno, 2 weeks  longer than for Attorney General Ashcroft, 1 day short of 2 weeks longer than for Attorney General Meese. Some of these people have some red flags too, but the Senate was able to do its job timely and I hope we will do so again.</paragraph>
