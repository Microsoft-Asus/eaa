  <narrative>BRING DOWN PRICES AT THE PUMP TODAY -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6579]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, every day Americans are struggling to drive their kids to school or run important errands. Every day Americans are struggling to fill up their gas tanks. And every day President Bush opposes a different Democratic solution to bringing down prices at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is day 9 of our efforts urging the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move that has a history of real results. But the White House has slammed the idea, saying it has been ineffective in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess President Bush doesn't remember when his father released oil from the Reserve in 1990 and oil prices dropped 33 percent immediately. Or when President Clinton took action in 2000. Real relief was apparent before oil even reached market. He also forgot when he himself released oil from the SPR only 2 years ago, and a barrel of oil dropped $5.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is action Americans are demanding; relief at the pump now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, releasing oil from the reserve is a tested and proven solution to providing struggling Americans with relief today. It is time President Bush stands up for consumers and taps into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</paragraph>
