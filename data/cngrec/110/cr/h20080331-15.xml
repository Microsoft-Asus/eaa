    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3651">H.R. 3651</bill> was introduced by the ranking member on the National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee, Representative Bishop. The legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain identified public lands to the State of Utah for use by the Utah National Guard. The land would revert to the United States should it ever cease to be used by the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to commend my colleague and friend, Representative Bishop, for his leadership in this matter and his willingness to work with the committee to resolve issues raised in earlier consideration of the legislation. I am sure that I speak for Chairman Rahall in that regard, and most certainly his fellow members on the Resources Committee. Therefore, I have no objection to the passage of <bill type="h" number="3651">H.R. 3651</bill>; and, in fact, enthusiastically endorse it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3651">H.R. 3651</bill>, the Utah National Guard Readiness Act, was cosponsored by the entire Utah delegation. There are only three of us, but we all agreed. So Mr. Matheson, Mr. Cannon, and I are sponsoring this bill, as requested by the Adjutant General of the Utah National Guard as well as the Governor of the State of Utah, in order to address the long-term growing pains of the National Guard at their Camp Williams headquarters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Utah National Guard has run out of State-controlled land on which to expand and build and support its vital national guard and national defense missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lands transferred under this act are already withdrawn from military use by the Guard from the Bureau of Land Management. So placing the land in the State's name for use by the National Guard will allow for the consolidation of ownership patterns in the critical headquarters area, and allow the State of Utah to bond for future Guard facilities in a more streamlined and cost-effective manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Rahall, and his staff, for working on this bill and moving it forward. I also thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, for his assistance and that of the subcommittee professional staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this day and age, we are asking the National Guardsmen to do more  and more heavy lifting for our Nation's defense and in deploying overseas in armed conflict. At the same time, we are asking them to also be on the frontlines in protect the homeland, and also to be there for our States and communities in times of emergency or natural disasters. We ask a lot of them, and they deliver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will allow our Utah National Guard to support its future mission growth in meeting these challenges. It is a small thing for us to be able to help them down the road in meeting their obligations. I thank my colleagues for consideration of this bill, and I strongly urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, and as chairman of the Air Land Subcommittee of that committee, I particularly want to commend Mr. Bishop for his remarks regarding the National Guard deployments and our obligations to them. And in recognition of that, I would like his remarks to be incorporated as my own with regard to his bill. With his permission I would like to do that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I think the gentleman from Hawaii could have done it much more artfully than I did, but I will be happy to allow him to do that.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3651">H.R. 3651</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
