    <paragraph>This morning, I talked about the Energy bill and the work of Democrats and Republicans to get it passed. I failed--and I apologize--to mention two of the most important people for getting that passed, two staff members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chris Miller, who works in my office, is such a wonderful, hard-working public servant. Chris is originally from Detroit. He has worked in Congress for 20 years, 18 years with the Senate. He worked for Senator Jeffords and for me on the Environment and Public Works Committee. His work ethic is unsurpassed. He has become a resource for the entire Senate, Democrats and Republicans. During the Energy bill, staff members came to him and some Members themselves came to him, asked where we  were. He gave them information as to where we were, where we were going. Chris has a master's degree from the University of Michigan. That is in natural resource management. He has a bachelor's also from the same institution in political science. I told him personally last night, after the bill passed, how much I appreciated his hard work. I want the record spread with the fact that he is an exemplary employee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to talk about someone I have worked with over the years because he has been in the Senate for a long time, and that is Bob Simon. Bob has a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from MIT in 1982. He is a person with a wide range of knowledge. Before coming to the Senate about 14 years ago or so, he worked at the Department of Energy and the National Research Council for the National Academies of Science and Engineering. He has served in a variety of science- and technology-related positions  in the Senate since 1993. He became a staff director for the overall committee the month the Democrats won the majority. He works very well with Senator Domenici, the ranking member and until recently the chairman of that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is really a good person, works so hard--another example of people we have here on Capitol Hill who are here because they believe in public service. That is why he is here. He is a person who works extremely hard, and his work on this bill was instrumental to its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask if the distinguished Republican leader has anything to say?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Republican leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. Let me just make the point that we have recently adopted <bill type="sr" number="250">S. Res. 250</bill>, which condemns the military junta in Burma and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The State Peace and Development Council, which rules Burma, is a truly outrageous, pariah regime that deserves universal condemnation. I only wish there were more countries that would join us in publicly criticizing the regime and in taking  action to help bring about positive change in this troubled nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader.</chair>
