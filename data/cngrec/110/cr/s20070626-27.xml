    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Dr. Nathan Carliner. Dr. Carliner was a well-respected cardiologist who practiced at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center and a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He will be remembered for his commitment to his patients, his colleagues, and his students, as well as his devotion to friends and family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Carliner was born in Baltimore and raised on South Road in Mount Washington. He followed in the footsteps of his father, Dr. Paul Carliner, who was also a doctor and codiscovered Dramamine in 1947. After his father's untimely death at just 46 years old, Nathan decided to devote his life to medicine. He was a 1958 Gilman School graduate and earned a bachelor of science degree at Johns Hopkins University. He went on to graduate from Hopkins Medical School in 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing his internship and residency, Dr. Carliner joined the Army Medical Corps. He was medical service chief at the 3rd Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, MASH, at Binh Thuy in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam war. After the war, Dr. Carliner studied cardiology and advanced electrocardiography before moving back to Baltimore in the 1970s. Once he returned to his hometown, Nathan continued his service both to his state and his country. He was a full professor at the University of Maryland  School of Medicine and he was associate chief of cardiology and director of noninvasive cardiology services at the veterans hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Carliner was known not just for his professionalism and his experience but also for his calming demeanor and his commitment to mentoring medical students and postgraduate trainees. Nathan touched so many lives and made many great contributions both to his field and to his colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nathan Carliner's death is a tragedy. Yet his life was a triumph. I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family--his brother Mark, his sister Esther Carliner Viros, and his four nephews, particularly Paul Carliner, who worked in my office for over 12 years and who shares his uncle's commitment and dedication to helping others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting this extraordinary man.</paragraph>
