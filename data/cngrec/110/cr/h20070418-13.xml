    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we continue to mourn the recent tragedy at Virginia Tech, we are reminded once again how fragile life is. Notwithstanding this tragedy, I would like to take a short moment to acknowledge the accomplishments of the University of Florida, which I represent in Gainesville, for repeating as men's national basketball champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic championship makes the Gators the first team since 1991-1992 to win back-to-back national titles and become only the seventh school ever to repeat as champions. With the Gators' 84-75 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes, Florida remains the only school in the NCAA history to hold both the men's basketball and football championship titles in the same year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Florida Gators are excellent representatives of both the university and  the great State of Florida in their focused persistence and unassailable desire to succeed. My colleagues, I take great pride in representing the University of Florida and congratulate Coach Billy Donovan and the entire university on this great accomplishment.</paragraph>
