    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in 1994 President Clinton, with the help of congressional Democrats, established the COPS program. The COPS program changed the way we fight crime in this country by giving local jurisdictions the support they needed to put over 100,000 new police officers on the street. The results were clear: a nationwide drop in crime and safer streets in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having been a police officer for 12 years, I proudly support the continuation of the COPS program. Unfortunately, the President and the Republicans have cut and gut the COPS program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COPS program is needed now more than ever. The threat of terrorism has put new burdens on our first responders, and recent news reports show violent crime in our cities is again on the rise. As a result, the Democrats will seek to put $1.5 billion forth in the budget to hire more police officers where they can do the most good, on the streets in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COPS program is a proven concept that has the full support of the law enforcement community. The Democrats will make the program even better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us work together to put cops back on the streets and give them the tools they need to keep us and America safe.</paragraph>
