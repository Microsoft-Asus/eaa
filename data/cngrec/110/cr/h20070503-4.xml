  <speaking speaker="400266" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the Reverend Rick Astle, who just delivered the invocation for the U.S. House as we begin this National Day of Prayer, a time when communities across America will be joining in prayer for our country today. And what better person to begin this day than a man whose prayer ministry has carried him across our country and who has written a book on this very subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and reared in Oklahoma, now residing in Whiteville, North Carolina, he is married to the former Donna Strickland of Lumberton, who is with us today; and they have one son, John, who is a law student at North Carolina Central.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick was educated at the University of Kentucky and at Southern Baptist Seminary, and he has served Southern Baptist churches for over 30 years, has spoken in over 20 States, and is author of the book, The Priority of Kingdom-Focused Prayer, and now is the Director of Missions for the Waccamaw Baptist Association in Conway, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as his brother-in-law, I am particularly honored to have him open us on this very special National Day of Prayer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
