    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today with my colleague Senator Smith because many Oregonians are hurting at home today. For 3 days this week our State has been slammed by a storm, the strength of which boggles the mind--hurricane force winds with gusts exceeding 120 miles an hour and almost a foot of rain, raising water levels in some areas by 25 feet in less than 48 hours. Hundreds of our people are now in shelters, tens of thousands are without power and don't have phones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thousands of Oregonians have been willing to step forward with incredible acts of courage and generosity. Using helicopters and boats, the Oregon National Guard and the Coast Guard have come through for our folks, rescuing hundreds of people trapped by rising water. Along with activating the National Guard, the Governor has brought every State agency in to help take care of the needs of the displaced, get communications restored, fix the roads, clear the bridges, and begin to assess the extraordinary  damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We especially today, both of Oregon's Senators, thank the Oregon chapter of the Red Cross, because they immediately moved into the affected areas and opened shelters. They provided meals and they have now been assisting with the cleanup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Governor has asked the President to declare a major disaster in our State and all of the Oregon congressional delegation joins the Governor in urging the President to grant this request immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Folks from FEMA, the emergency management agency, have arrived in our State. They are going to begin making formal damage assessments today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith and I talked to Secretary Chertoff on the phone and we asked for the Department of Homeland Security to pull out all the stops to aid our State immediately. The immediate priority is to get our citizens the help they need to survive during these critical days. Once the full extent of the damage is known, Oregon and Washington, the hard-hit Pacific Northwest, are going to need Federal assistance in recovering from the disaster. This is surely going to entail rebuilding roads  and other essential parts of our infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith and I are committed this morning to getting the help that is so urgently needed by the people of Oregon. We believe it is critical in terms of timing that this help be made available now so folks can get back on their feet. We intend to pursue a variety of options, including adding emergency funding to future spending bills if that is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the rest of my time to my colleague Senator Smith. We believe on Oregon issues there are no partisan questions. Today the people of our State are hurting and both of Oregon's Senators are committed to getting the help that is needed to sustain lives at home, to the Pacific Northwest, and the people of Oregon immediately.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague for being here with me today. Moments ago, we phoned Secretary Chertoff to discuss how we, as Oregon Senators, can best help those of our State who have been devastated by this storm. Both Senator Wyden and I wish we could be with them now. On Monday, Senator Wyden and I hosted our sixth annual economic forum in Portland. We rushed to the airport after the event in the midst of this incredible storm to find that our outgoing flight  was unable land in such horrendous conditions. We fortunate enough to find another flight to Washington so we could be present for Tuesday's vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we would both like to be with the citizens of our State. We are instead using what leverage we have in Washington to ensure the Federal Government responds to the best of its ability. We have called upon the President to declare this event a major disaster and free up Federal resources to begin rebuilding this devastated area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would like in particular to commend FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard. FEMA took a lot of criticism as a result of Hurricane Katrina, but their response in Oregon has been spectacular. We thank them on behalf of all Oregonians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also thank the Coast Guard. Within the first 24 hours, the Coast Guard responded to well over 600 emergency calls and was able to save a tremendous number of lives. For this, we thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I consider our country, our values and the kinds of catastrophes that have beset our country, we understand that we cannot stop Mother Nature. But these catastrophes cannot and will not break the spirit of the American people. I look at the great motto above your desk, sir, E pluribus unum--out of  many, one. I am reminded that when events like this occur, the many show up and become one. They risk their own lives to save others. This is a tremendous  act of selflessness and I applaud the heros fighting to save our fellow Oregonians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank our Federal responders, and I urge a disaster declaration as soon as possible. In the Northwest, we have natural disasters ranging from earthquakes to volcanoes. And there are storms that barrel in off the Pacific which can do an unbelievable amount of damage. They cause landslides, tear the roofs off our homes, and swell our rivers to record-breaking levels. Near the town of Tillamook, a river rose literally 20.5 feet within just a few hours, sweeping away livestock, homes, and tragically,  unsuspecting residents. But the response from all types of government and nongovernment organizations, including the Red Cross, has been magnificent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many church communities are coming to the rescue. Communications have been lost. Amateur radio operators have filled the airwaves, connecting rescuers to those in need of rescue. We thank them and pledge that--as united Oregon Senators--we will do whatever we can for the sake of our State. We thank the Federal Government for their swift response and again urge an immediate disaster declaration to strengthen our ability to heal the psychological and physical wound left by this storm. We will begin  to repair the damage that has afflicted so many counties in Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I assure the people of our State that we in the Federal Government will do our part. We will stay on this job until it is done and until Oregon has fully recovered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
