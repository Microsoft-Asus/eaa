  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let this be the day that, respectful of the sacrifice of our men and women overseas, inspired and emboldened by the clarion call of the American people on November 7, 2006, and determined to show a decent respect for the opinions of thoughtful and caring people the world over, this Congress says to an administration that has been arrogant in its bearing and incompetent in its execution, no longer shall you turn a blind eye to the readiness of our troops. No longer shall  you ignore the needs of our veterans. At long last, you are being called to account for a failed policy in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the supplemental appropriation bill, which marks the return of sanity and wisdom in the conduct of American foreign policy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
