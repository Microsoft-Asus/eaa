  <narrative>REMEMBERING MONE LITTLE -- (Senate - January 31, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="539">S539</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Monday marked the 1-year anniversary of the tragic death of Mone Little. On January 28, 2007, 19-year-old Mone, granddaughter of late Motown legend and lead singer of The Temptations, David Ruffin, was gunned down in a drive-by shooting while walking with three friends in Detroit. While Mone was not the target, she was the only one in the group who was shot. Those responsible for this heinous crime have not been caught.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mone, a student at Oakland Community College, was in the process of exploring her dreams. The community continues to grieve the senseless loss of this young woman. Unfortunately, we experience too many of these tragedies. Each year approximately 30,000 Americans are killed by a firearm, an average of 10 children and 74 adults each day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us continue to urge the Senate to pass sensible gun legislation. Law enforcement officers have requested help in their difficult task of keeping our streets safe. Those that have been personally impacted by gun tragedies have called for change in the hope of protecting others from the pain they have endured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have a right to expect better protection against gun violence. Until Congress acts, many more lives will be lost. I once again urge my colleagues to take up and pass sensible gun legislation so that we can help prevent such tragedies.</paragraph>
