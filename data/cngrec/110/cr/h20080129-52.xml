    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to a non-profit community organization in my 10th Congressional District of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce is celebrating more than 100 years of dedicated service to Augusta, Georgia's economic development. Founded in 1905, the chamber has grown to include more than 1,100 members. The chamber and its members provide citizens with a strong business environment that increases employment, retail trade and commerce, and industrial growth in Augusta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce has worked to promote a prosperous future for all Augustans through legislative efforts and through networking programs, such as Women in Business, Leadership Augusta, and the Chamber Business Academy. The chamber promotes healthy and productive workforces through its nationally-recognized Drugs Don't Work program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce is also committed to being a good neighbor, with committees designated to serve as liaisons between businesses and local educators and military communities. Furthermore, the chamber promotes business while working carefully to protect Augusta's natural environment. The chamber works with State and Federal agencies to minimize the impact economic development has on the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such a diligent organization is to be commended for its efforts. The Augusta Metro Chamber of Commerce is an investment in the present and future well-being of the Augusta community. As it celebrates a centennial milestone, may this chamber of commerce continue steadfast in its work to ensure Augusta's continued competitiveness in our domestic and global economies.</paragraph>
