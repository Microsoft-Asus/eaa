    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise this morning to grieve, along with the residents of my entire district, over the loss of two members of the Virgin Islands National Guard who were lost when the Black Hawk helicopter they were on was shot down in Iraq on Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thank God for them, their professionalism, dedication and their service, Lieutenant Colonel David Canegata III and Sergeant Floyd James Lake. And we thank God for the over 400 soldiers, men and women, who have served in this war, including five others who also made the ultimate sacrifice. We pray for their families and for the day that we will bring all of our soldiers home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, especially now, I am forced to ask on their behalf and on behalf of all of the people of the Virgin Islands who have sent our loved ones to every war from the Revolutionary to this in higher per capita numbers than most States, why it is that some would seek to deny us an even limited vote in the Committee of the Whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These brave men died in support of extending democracy in the Middle East. Every Member of this body should vote to extend democracy here at home, to support your colleagues and fellow Americans who happen to live in the District and territories, and we should have a unanimous vote on <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
