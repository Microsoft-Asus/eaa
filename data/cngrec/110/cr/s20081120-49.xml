  <narrative>FORT POLK BARRACKS PRIVATIZATION PILOT PROGRAM -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10731">S10731</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on September 27, the Senate passed the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, which the President signed into law on October 14. The legislation includes critical provisions that will directly improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform, support needed reforms in the operations of the Department of Defense and provide our soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel and marines with the tools they need to defend our freedom.  I thank and commend Senator Levin and our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for the thorough work on this detailed legislation and their perseverance in crafting the legislation in a difficult and at times uncertain process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were a number of filed floor amendments to the bill that were not  able to be considered because of the procedural situation on the floor in September. The managers of the bill, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, stated that they had prepared a set of over 90 cleared amendments in a managers' package for which they believed they had unanimous consent to include in the bill. It is my understanding that one of those amendments was  the provision I had filed to expand the existing pilot authority in section 2881a of title 10, to authorize the Army to carry out a pilot program using the private sector for the acquisition or construction of military unaccompanied housing for all ranks in an arrangement similar to what we have carried successfully with the privatization of family housing and senior</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army already has five similar privatization projects underway for senior unaccompanied enlisted personnel or officers. The business case for these projects shows that they are not only less costly than traditional government-funded construction and sustainment, but more importantly, the living conditions are vastly improved as soldiers have access to larger, modern apartments on post. The living conditions for these soldiers and officers will be enhanced to the same level as that of military  members with families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given our Nation's current financial crisis, defense spending is likely to come under great stress over the next few years. Historically the Army and the other services have had great challenges in maintaining even minimum levels of housing sustainment and revitalization funding to keep our barracks fit for our soldiers. I can speak from personal experience about the serious deficiencies in the barracks at Fort Polk in Leesville. Despite the recent increase in Army funding for barracks revitalization  there, I worry that needed long-term funding will be difficult to secure under the traditional model to prevent deterioration in the longer run. Improved quality of life, including housing, is critical to the retention of our enlisted soldiers, and critical to keeping our All Volunteer force strong. Partnerships between the Army and the private sector for this segment of our military housing will be needed as a fundamental long-term solution to providing the best housing for our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the procedural setback in September, I appreciate the support we received for our amendment and am committed to continue working with the Armed Services Committee to advance this issue in 2009. We are also hopeful that the Army will use its existing authorities to begin extending the successful privatization model to construction and revitalization of Barracks for all of our soldiers.</paragraph>
