    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House will be voting on the Energy Independence and Security Act. With this legislation, the new Democratic Congress is leading America in a new direction on energy policy, the most significant energy bill in a generation. We are taking a major step toward ending our dependence on foreign oil by increasing efficiency standards for cars and trucks for the first time in 30 years. This will reduce America's need for oil by 1.1 million gallons per day, cut millions  of tons of global warming pollution, and save families up to $1,000 every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill implements landmark energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, which will save American families and businesses billions of dollars in unnecessary energy costs. Finally, the bill boosts the production of environmentally protective home-grown biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can and we will do more: promote solar, wind and other renewable energy sources, for example. But this legislation finally begins to address high gas prices, America's oil addiction and the global warming crisis. It will help create hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy technologies. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a new direction of energy. Vote for <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
