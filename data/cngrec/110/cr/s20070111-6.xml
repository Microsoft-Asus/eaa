    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning business for 90 minutes. The Republicans will control the first 45 minutes, the majority will have the remaining 45 minutes. Following this period of morning business, the Senate will resume the ethics legislation that is pending before this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I indicated we would vote this morning on the Stevens second-degree amendment dealing with airplanes. However, Senator Stevens decided to withdraw the amendment in preparation to file another one. There were some problems with that, as he indicated to me. I am sure he will have a new amendment soon. He is working with somebody on this side of the aisle, I understand, to come up with a second-degree amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other amendments offered yesterday are still pending, and, again, I hope we can move forward in disposing of these amendments. I think Senator Durbin will be here soon--as soon as we have the opportunity after we finish morning business--to move to table some of the amendments dealing with appropriations matters.</paragraph>
