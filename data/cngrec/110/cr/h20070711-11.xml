    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act. For far too long we've watched as Pell Grants have stayed flat and tuition has continued to soar, over 40 percent in the last 6 years alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students today are graduating with greater and greater debt. As a result, they are increasingly unwilling to take critical public sector jobs such as first responders, law enforcement officials, nurses and teachers because of the modest salaries. For example, nearly 32 percent of graduates pursuing teacher careers can't afford to repay their loans on a starting teacher's salary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing the College Cost Reduction Act, we are encouraging and rewarding public service by providing $5,000 in loan forgiveness to graduates who take public service jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is one excellent provision that makes an important investment in our communities, and it's just one of the many reasons I'm going to be supporting this legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support the College Cost Reduction Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
