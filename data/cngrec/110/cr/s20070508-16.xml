  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="NOMINATION OF FREDERICK J. KAPALA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say a few words about Judge Kapala. Frederick Kapala has been nominated by Senator Obama and myself to be a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Kapala has served with distinction as a State court judge in Illinois for the past quarter century, and he has earned a great reputation. It is a very positive thing to say that 99 percent of the attorneys surveyed gave Judge Kapala a positive recommendation for his temperament,  integrity, and management skills. He had a unanimous rating of "well qualified" by the American Bar Association, the highest rating a nominee can receive. He has been judged by many to be an excellent candidate for the Federal bench.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have met with him personally. I have met his family. I like this man. I think he will serve our judiciary well. I hope when we vote on this in a few minutes he will receive an overwhelming vote of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="NOMINATION OF FREDERICK J. KAPALA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the nomination of Judge Frederick J. Kapala to serve as a judge on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Kapala's career exemplifies a strong commitment to public service. He currently serves as an appellate judge on the Second District Appellate Court in Illinois, a position he has held since 2001. Prior to his service on the Second District Appellate Court, Judge Kapala was a circuit court judge for the 17th Judicial  Circuit for Winnebago and Boone Counties for 7 years. Prior to that service, Judge Kapala was an Associate Circuit Court Judge for the same circuit for 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1976, Judge Kapala became an assistant State's attorney in Winnebago County. He made a brief foray into private practice, joining the law firm of Pedderson, Menzimer, Conde, Stoner, and Killoren in Rockford from 1977 to 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Kapala is a magna cum laude graduate of Marquette University. He proudly served his country in the U.S. Army on both Active and Reserve duty from 1970 to 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Kapala has dedicated his life and career to the public good. Whether it was his military service or his judicial service to the good people of Rockford and the counties of Winnebago and Boone, Judge Kapala has served with compassion and distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join the Senate in confirming him to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois who has spoken in support of the nomination of Judge Frederick J. Kapala to be a U.S. district court judge for the Northern District of Illinois. He has an outstanding academic record--graduating magma cum laude from Marquette University in 1972, where he was Phi Beta Kappa. He obtained his law degree from the University of Illinois, where he was a moot court board member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has a professional career which is diversified and with extensive judicial experience. From 1970 to 1980, Judge Kapala served our country in the United States Army, on both active and reserve duty. He obtained the rank of Captain before his honorable discharge. Upon graduation from law school, he was assistant State's attorney--that is the prosecuting attorney in Illinois--for 1 year. He then practiced law for 5 years. He has been an associate circuit court judge from 1982 to 1994 and a circuit  court judge for 7 years, until 2001. Since 2001, he has been an appellate court justice for the State of Illinois. He has extensive community activities. He was rated by the American Bar Association as unanimously "well qualified."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, a summary of Judge Kapala's curriculum vitae be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>My sense from prior confirmation proceedings and votes in the Senate is that Judge Kapala will receive a strong vote, probably unanimous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the remaining time, I will discuss what we are doing on the immigration bill because there have been so many inquiries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the history of the immigration legislation from the 109th Congress. The Judiciary Committee reported out a bill. It came to the floor of the Senate, with many amendments, and it was passed with substantial bipartisan support. The House of Representatives had a very different configuration on the bill. They were concerned only with the border security, contrasted with the Senate bill, which was a comprehensive bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had numerous meetings in an effort to structure a consensus bill in the course of the last many weeks. For many weeks, we met on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock, with as many as a dozen Republican Senators present, with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Commerce present. We have had substantial White House involvement reflecting the President's statement that he wants a comprehensive immigration reform bill. We have spent many hours on  extended meetings with Democrats. There were half a dozen Democrats attending these meetings and a rather unique process illustrated last week where we met for 2 1/2  hours with a dozen Senators being present. It is pretty hard to keep a dozen Senators sitting in one room at one time going over a great many ideas. We have come to an agreement on what we have called a "grand bargain," which is the outline of an immigration bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that we need to protect our borders and we have legislated for fencing. We want to provide fencing to protect the major metropolitan areas, and we can't have a fence for the entire length of the border. We have proposed and are prepared to enact legislation which would provide for 6,000 additional Border Patrol agents to bring the number to 12,000. We are proposing very strong employer sanctions. We do not want employment in the United States to be a magnet for illegal immigration,  and it is now technically possible to have foolproof identification. It can be costly and we are still working through the details, but there is no doubt we want to secure the border and stop illegal immigration as the first item.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about triggers so that we don't move ahead to dealing with the 11 million undocumented immigrants or dealing with a temporary worker program until we have solved the problem of securing the border and providing for identification so that there is a basis for using tough sanctions on the employers. But you can't do that unless they have a fair opportunity to know who is legal and who is illegal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are rejecting the idea of amnesty for the 11 million undocumented immigrants. They are going to have to earn being on the citizenship path at the end. It will be required that they pay taxes, have community roots, have a substantial period of employment, and that they learn English. We are going to do our best to deport those who have criminal records. There is a real security risk with some of the undocumented immigrants who have criminal records and where they do commit crimes. It is a practical  impossibility to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are trying to structure a temporary worker program which is temporary, coming only for the purpose of filling needs and then returning to their in native countries. We are looking at a system so that if there are U.S.  citizens, people in this country who can take the jobs, they will have the first choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader has stated publicly his intention to proceed under rule XIV and file a bill this week--perhaps tomorrow, and it will be listed for floor debate next Monday. There is a lot of concern among Republicans about proceeding in that way with concern that the bill that was reported out of committee does not have widespread support and the bill that passed the Senate does not have widespread support. And that there is a disinclination how it will go. Nobody knows for sure, but there  is a disinclination to support a motion to proceed, raising the possibility that there may be a filibuster there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a concern in many quarters that we need more time. We have been proceeding diligently with very extended meetings. I have to confess there has been a fair amount of wheel spinning, but that we are not ready to proceed next Monday on the 14th to take up the bill the last 2 weeks before Memorial Day, as the leader has scheduled. I can understand the majority leader's concern about moving ahead and holding our feet to the fire to try to produce a bill but we are still working on it. Staff  worked over the weekend. There was a meeting at the White House on Sunday. I had an extended discussion yesterday with Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy met with one of the Secretaries, and we are working at top speed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will certainly be preferable if we can come up with a bill that would not have to have <bill type="s" number="2611">S. 2611</bill>, which passed the Senate last year or the chairman's mark or the bill that came out of Judiciary. I have been asked about this every time I step into the corridor, so I thought it would be useful to give this brief summary, without impacting on Senator Leahy's time. I will note that some Democratic time on the judicial nomination was taken up by Senator Durbin earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frederick Joseph Kapala, Northern District of Illinois</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Frederick Joseph Kapala was first nominated on December 6, 2006. He was renominated on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on his nomination on March 13, 2007, and he was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April 25, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Kapala has truly outstanding academic and professional qualifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He received his B.A. magma cum laude, in 1972 from Marquette University where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Pi Gamma Mu (social science honors). He received his J.D. from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1976. During law school, he participated in Moot Court and served as a member of the Moot Court Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1970 to 1980, Judge Kapala served our country in the United States Army, on both active and reserve duty. He obtained the rank of Captain before his honorable discharge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation from law school, Judge Kapala served for one year as an Assistant State's Attorney in the County of Winnebago, Illinois before joining the law firm of Pedderson, Menzimer, Conde, Stoner and Killoren in 1977. He practiced both litigation and transactional law with that firm until 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 1981 and 1982, he also served part time as a Special Assistant Attorney General in the Illinois Attorney General's Office, prosecuting consumer fraud cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a practitioner, Judge Kapala tried over 100 cases to verdict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982, Judge Kapala was first appointed to the state court bench as an Associate Circuit Court Judge for the 17th Judicial Circuit, a state trial court. While serving in this office, he was presiding judge of the juvenile court in Winnebago County from 1989 until 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, Judge Kapala was first elected a full Circuit Court Judge in the same circuit, and since then, he has been re-elected twice. During his tenure in this capacity, Judge Kapala was appointed as the presiding judge of the criminal court division in Winnebago County from 1995 until 2001. In 2001, he was assigned to serve as a Judge of the Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ABA unanimously rated Mr. Kapala as "Well Qualified."</paragraph>

  <narrative>(The remarks of Mr. LEAHY pertaining to the introduction of <bill type="s" number="1327">S. 1327</bill> and <bill type="s" number="1328">S. 1328</bill> are located in today's Record under "Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.")</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="IMMIGRATION REFORM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are making significant progress today with another confirmation of a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. I am sure Frederick J. Kapala will be confirmed for the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. His nomination is supported by the home State Senators. I thank Senator Durbin for chairing the hearing on this nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Kapala serves as a state appellate judge on the Second District Appellate Court in Illinois. He has almost 20 years of experience as a state trial court judge. Before coming to the bench, he worked for the Rockford, Illinois law firm of Pedderson, Menzimer, Conde, Stoner and Killoren, and he worked as an Assistant State's Attorney in Winnebago County. Prior to his legal career, he served 10 years in the U.S. Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will be the 17th judicial confirmation this year. The calendar just turned to the month of May, it is spring, and we have already confirmed as many judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 session, when President Clinton's nominees were being reviewed by the Republican-controlled Senate majority. We have done as much in May in a Democrat-controlled Senate as the Republican-controlled Senate did in a whole year for President Clinton. That was a session when not a single circuit court  nominee was confirmed. Of course, we have already confirmed two circuit court nominees in the early months of this session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention this because it is somewhat frustrating to hear the gross misstatements made by some of the Republican leaders, such as Vice President Cheney, Mr. Rove, and others, who speak for the President on the pace of judicial nominees. Not only is this the 17th judicial confirmation this year, it is also the 117th judicial confirmation in the approximately 2 years I have served as Judiciary chairman over the past 6 years. That exceeds by more than a dozen the confirmations Senator Hatch  presided over during the 2 years he was Judiciary chairman. It also exceeds by more than a dozen the district court nominees confirmed during the two years he was Judiciary Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the confirmation of Judge Hardiman to the Third Circuit earlier this year, the total circuit court confirmations achieved during my chairmanships, which have not yet extended over the 24 months of Senator Hatch's chairmanship, also exceed those achieved during his. I only mention this because if you listen to what comes down to being total mistruths by the Vice President or others, you would think we blocked the President's judges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Actually, we have done far better for President Bush--far better than when a Republican majority was here and pocket filibustered 61 of President Clinton's nominees. It is a little known, and obviously unappreciated, fact that during the more than 6 years of the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges, and more total judges have been confirmed while I served as Judiciary Committee Chairman than during the tenures of either of the two Republican Chairman working with Republican  Senate majorities did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 judicial vacancies. Yet, the President has sent only 25 nominations for these vacancies. Twenty-three of these vacancies--almost half--have no nominee. Of the 16 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for six of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the harping and the criticism, the Judiciary Committee has been working hard to make progress on those nominations the President has sent to us. Of course, when he sends nominees that he knows are unacceptable to home state Senators, it is not a formula for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Judge Kapala, and his family, on his confirmation today.</paragraph>
