    <paragraph>Madam President, before the Senator proceeds, I wish to take a minute and thank all of our staffs who worked tremendously hard to get this bill to the floor, the staff on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd's personal staff--many Members worked very hard, along with their staff members but particularly those people who sit in the back row back there and are not recognized who stay up very late to get this to all of us. To all of our floor staff, I say thank you for  your tremendous work in getting us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
