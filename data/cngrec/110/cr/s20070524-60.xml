    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Philip, SD. The town of Philip will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Haakon County, Philip was founded in 1907 with the arrival of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. It was named after James "Scotty" Philip, a local rancher who was known for his efforts to preserve the buffalo population from extinction. Philip has been a successful and thriving community for the past 100 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Philip on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
