    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will proceed to a period for the transaction of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we were able to reach an agreement to consider <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, the tax extenders legislation. Following morning business tomorrow, the Senate will consider three amendments to the bill, with limited debate and votes in relation to the amendments. Senators should expect the first amendment vote to occur prior to the caucus lunches and the remaining votes in the afternoon. One of the things to consider now is maybe not having morning business tomorrow to move this along more rapidly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican leader is seeking recognition, and when he finishes, I will give a few remarks.</paragraph>
