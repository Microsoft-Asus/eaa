  <narrative>MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY FACE -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10702]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. EMANUEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the past week, we negotiated what the financial markets needed and what the public market wanted, taxpayer protections. This is only the first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we address the balance sheets of banks, the next step must now address the checkbooks for middle class families and the struggles that they face. The middle class today is working harder, earning less, and paying more. In the last 7 years, median household income has dropped by $1,200, and costs for energy, health care, as well as college education, have gone up $4,800.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The middle class is hurting and squeezing. The second economic program must put their needs at the heart of what we do, because today it is important to have universal access to savings, universal access to higher education, a middle class tax cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you work, you have health care. We must build an energy policy that makes this a hybrid economy, an agenda that puts the middle class at the heart of its economic strategy. Unlike the last 7 years, we will make sure that what we are doing today is successful in the future, because we must strengthen the economy while we save and deal with the financial markets crisis on this short-term basis.</paragraph>
