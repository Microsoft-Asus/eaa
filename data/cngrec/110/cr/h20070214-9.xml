  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the House is conducting the most important debate of this Congress, whether Members will support the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq. I oppose the President's plan, and during this debate I am hoping that those who support the escalation of the war can answer a couple of questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, if the President is allowed to move forward, how do we guarantee these troops have the protective armor they need? Earlier this month we learned that troop escalation would create logistical hurdles for both the Army and Marines, which are already short thousands of vehicles and armor kits. Members who support the President's plan need to explain how do we provide the troops the equipment they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members who support the plan also need to explain where do we come up with the additional troops that will be needed to support 21,500 combat troops. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates as many as 48,000 troops may be required to implement the plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these are questions that supporters of escalating the war in Iraq should ask before they vote to escalate the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
