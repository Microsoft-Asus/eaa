    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take a moment to remember a North Dakota hero who passed away last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 3 miles straight west of this Senate Chamber lies the Iwo Jima memorial. Its centerpiece is a statue of six men raising an American flag to  symbolize the capture of Mount Suribachi and the ensuing U.S. military victory at Iwo Jima.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 23, 1945, a 24-year-old marine from North Dakota named Charles W. Lindberg played a key role in the events immortalized by the Iwo Jima memorial. On that day, he was part of the group that raised the first American flag to fly over Japanese soil in the Second World War. Many names from that war stand out in our memories: Normandy, Midway, the Battle of the Bulge. But perhaps none stands out like Iwo Jima.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The battle for Iwo Jima was one of the fiercest of the entire war. The American attack, planned to capture the two airfields on the island and provide a staging area for B-29 bombing runs on the Japanese home islands, was the first invasion of traditionally Japanese territory in the war. Fighting on the island lasted over a month. Over 20,000 Americans were injured and 6,825 more heroically made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on Iwo Jima North Dakota's Marine Cpl. Charles Lindberg made his mark on history. The indelible image of the battle for Iwo Jima is of six men raising an American flag atop the island. But those six men were not the first group of men to claim Iwo Jima for the United States. That honor belongs to a patrol that included Corporal Lindberg. The distinction between the two was one he spent a lifetime explaining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 23, Corporal Lindberg took his 72-pound flame-thrower to enemy pillboxes at the base of Mount Suribachi and set out for the top with five other marines, an old pipe to be used as a flagpole, and the American flag. They gained the summit and planted the flag. Lindberg recalled that the flag's raising created such a commotion of cheers and whistles that it brought the enemy back out. That threat drew Lindberg back to battle, and so he missed the raising of the second flag, which was  captured for history and recreated at the Iwo Jima memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lindberg won a Silver Star for his bravery that day, and a Purple Heart for the injury that led to his evacuation from the island less than one week later. Thirty-six members of his 40-man patrol were killed or wounded while fighting on Iwo Jima, which would rage for a full month after the flag-raising. Lindberg was fortunate enough to return home, to marry, and to live out a somewhat quieter life as an electrician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 24, at the age of 83, he passed away. He was the last surviving member of the group of heroes who had the honor of raising the first American flag to fly over Japanese territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is it that makes a young man from a simple town like Grand Forks, ND, risk his life the way Corporal Lindberg did on Iwo Jima? Was it the fight for freedom and liberty? Was it his patriotism and his love of country? Was it his bravery and courage? Perhaps it was all those things. In fact, I would say that the story of Charles Lindberg presents the best of all that is American. Duty. Honor. Bravery. Sacrifice. I am proud to say that Corporal Lindberg comes from my home State of North Dakota.  I am proud to call Corporal Lindberg an American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lindberg's passing serves as a reminder to be thankful for the heroic service of all those who answered the call to serve our country. The service of the millions of young men called to duty in World War II--and in all of our nation's wars--can never be forgotten. We are all touched in some way by heroes like Charles Lindberg, whether they are our family members, our loved ones, or our neighbors. Let us always remember the debt we owe these heroes, and always cherish the freedom they successfully  fought to preserve.</paragraph>
