    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as I closed the rally today with 400 veterans in support of our troops and their mission in Iraq and Afghanistan, I quoted John Stuart Mill, who said, "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral unpatriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. A person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight, nothing they care more about than their own personal safety, is a miserable creature who has  no chance of ever being free unless those very freedoms are made and kept by better persons than themselves."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those better persons are our Nation's veterans, the men and women in uniform, and today may God almighty, Jehovah God, bless and keep those brave Americans in harm's way on our behalf.</paragraph>
