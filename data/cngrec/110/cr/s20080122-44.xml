  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="TRIBUTE TO REVEREND DR. WALLACE S. HARTSFIELD, SR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a devoted pastor, community leader, father and friend: Reverend Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, Sr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 1 of this year, Reverend Hartsfield retired as senior pastor of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church in Kansas City, MO. He served as the congregation's pastor for more than 40 years and as a dedicated member of the clergy for more than 55 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hartsfield has worked as a key leader and mentor in social, political, and religious circles in Kansas City and throughout the country. He has served at every level of the National Baptist Convention of America and as the president of the General Baptist Convention of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, has dubbed this remarkable leader the "Godfather of Preachers" for his ministerial knowledge and superior oratorical skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Countless Kansas Citians--and Americans--have been touched by this man and his messages. Always positive, Dr. Hartsfield speaks out for peace, social and racial justice, AIDS intervention, faith, and hard work. And like a true pastor, he cares deeply for his congregation and the surrounding community. My guess is he will not slow down much even in retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a measure of our appreciation for Pastor Hartsfield's long service to the community, Congressman Cleaver, Senator McCaskill, and I worked to enact legislation designating the U.S. Postal Service facility at 4320 Blue Parkway in Kansas City the "Wallace S. Hartsfield Post Office Building." This designation is but small recognition of Dr. Hartsfield's many accomplishments as a minister, dedicated community activist, civil servant, and compassionate role model. I am proud  to call him a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Future generations will look to his leadership and example to find hope and inspiration. Dr. Hartsfield has truly made the world a better place.</paragraph>
