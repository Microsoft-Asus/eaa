    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 80th birthday of an American hero, the late C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 7 years, I have fought for a national holiday to honor C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez, a man who not only carried the torch for justice and freedom, but was the hope of thousands of impoverished people. C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez believed in "la causa," the cause; and he believed in "la huelga," the struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach his birthday, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="76">H. Res. 76</bill>, a resolution that educates our youth about his heroic life, celebrates his accomplishments and honors him with a national holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The battle for social justice is far from over. But in the words of C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez, "si se puede."</paragraph>
