    <paragraph>Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the South River Ruritan Club in Edgewater, MD, on their 50th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The South River Ruritan Club, a community service organization, was chartered on March 13, 1957, and for 50 years has been providing much needed services to the citizens of Edgewater, Annapolis, and southern Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Club, whose members are all volunteers, have contributed well in excess of half a million dollars in direct financial aid and countless hours of time, to numerous community service projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The club awards local students scholastic and vocational scholarships and provides assistance to local Scout troops, youth athletics, and other youth-related programs. They conduct an annual essay contest for fifth grade students and have sponsored students to the National Association of Student Council Conference and Exchange Student programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They contribute annually to the local fire and rescue departments, the Maryland and Anne Arundel County police departments, and support environmental programs, including efforts to protect the Chesapeake Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Active Duty military, retired and disabled military, and veterans organizations also benefit from the volunteer efforts of the club. They have sent direct aid to our troops in Iraq and provide additional financial assistance through their military's morale and welfare assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their work also includes assistance in such areas as financial aid to needy families, victims of violent crimes, families displaced by catastrophes such as fires, and hurricanes, and assistance through Habitat for Humanity. They contribute annually to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital Children's Center and they loan wheelchairs, walkers, and other medical assistance equipment to members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the South River Ruritan Club on their wonderful record of community service over the last 50 years and wish them enormous success as they continue their commitment to improving their communities and supporting the families who live in and around them. This club and their membership, both past and present, have every reason to be proud of what they have accomplished.</paragraph>
