    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Congressional Prayer Caucus to formally acknowledge the importance of prayer in American life and history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I remind my colleagues, constituents and country of our need for prayer by reading a portion of the words offered on the floor of the United States Senate on June 13, 1947, by Peter Marshall. Mr. Marshall prayed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"God of our fathers, in whose name this Republic was born, we pray that by Thy help we may be worthy to receive Thy blessings upon our labors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In this world where men have made deceit a habit, lying an art, and cruelty a science, help us to show the moral superiority of the way of life we cherish. Here may men see truth upheld, honesty loved and kindness practiced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We do not pray that other Nations may love us, but that they may know that we stand for what is right, unafraid, with the courage of our convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"May our private lives and our public actions be consistent with our prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
