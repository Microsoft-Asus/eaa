    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Washington this week, there are thousands and thousands of African American women who are members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. That was the first Greek letter African American sorority in this country. It's been a sorority that's been intertwined with all of the activities of this society. In the last 100 years through women's suffrage and the civil right's movement, there have been active members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Service and scholarship are the bywords of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Their members have included Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, and honorary members have included Eleanor Roosevelt, and announced yesterday, Michelle Obama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Alpha Kappa Alpha women are doing good works in this country, and I appreciate their including me. I will be joining them at a luncheon today. And I congratulate them on 100 years of service started at Howard University here in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
