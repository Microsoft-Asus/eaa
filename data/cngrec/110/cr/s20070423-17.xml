    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to congratulate Dr. Howard-Yana Shapiro, who will receive the Organic Leadership Award on May 7, 2007. The award is bestowed annually by the Organic Trade Association on individuals who have demonstrated leadership and vision in furthering the goals of organic agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Shapiro has had a very impressive career in organic agriculture, having been involved with sustainable agricultural and agroforestry systems, plant genetics, and food production systems for over 35 years. He is best known as the principal author of "Gardening for the Future of the Earth," which shows how to "create natural bounty in your own backyard and help save the planet one seed at a time."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his long and diverse career, Dr. Shapiro has been a community gardening activist, a university professor for 15 years, twice a Fulbright Scholar, twice a Ford Foundation Fellow, and winner of the National Endowment for the Humanities Award. He has worked with indigenous communities, nongovernmental organizations, governmental agencies, and private institutions throughout the world, including Conservation International, World Wildlife Fund, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Agency for  International Development, U.S. Forest Service, ICRAF, The World Agroforestry Centre, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and many other national and regional agricultural institutions in Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Senegal, South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, Dr. Shapiro has held a leadership role in Seeds of Change, the largest certified organic seed company in the country. Located along the Rio Grande in El Guique, NM, Seeds of Change, a division of Mars, Incorporated, is a pioneering cultivator of organically grown seeds for home and market growers, a leader in the organic foods industry, and a valued resource for organic farmers. Dr. Shapiro has been dedicated to Seeds of Change since its inception and was a key figure during the  launching of the Seeds of Change 100 percent certified organic food line in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that New Mexico is home to Seeds of Change and that the company, and organic agriculture as an industry, has been so well served by the expertise and vision of Dr. Shapiro throughout its growth. Again, I congratulate Dr. Howard-Yana Shapiro for receiving the Organic Trade Association's highest honor. I thank him for his commitment to furthering organic agriculture around the world, and I wish him continued success in the years ahead.</paragraph>
