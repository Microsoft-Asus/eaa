    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 410 recognizes the great accomplishments, sacrifices, and service of the men and women of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the occasion of the Bureau's 100th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt and Attorney General Charles Bonaparte established a new Federal investigative agency consisting of a small force of special agents to assist States in combating crimes occurring across State lines. Little could they have envisioned that their idea would have evolved into one of the most foremost investigative agencies in history. It is fitting that we honor the men and women who have brought the FBI that stature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of its existence, the Bureau's men and women have proven time and again that when the Nation calls upon them, they are ready to meet any challenge. They have worked tirelessly to stem foreign threats against the United States during two world wars and the Cold War by investigating espionage and sabotage on American shores. The FBI helped to keep our Nation safe, and over the course of time became one of the foremost professional espionage investigative agencies in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI's been called upon on numerous occasions to protect the civil rights of Americans and to bring justice to those who violate them. Today, the FBI remains the foremost Federal law enforcement agency for investigating serious civil rights violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI has been called upon to investigate various types of violent crime, organized criminal enterprises, international fraud schemes, and financial and other forms of white-collar crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as the Internet has so vastly expanded and transformed the world communication and commerce, we have tasked the FBI with protecting us against cyber-based attacks and high technology crimes. The Bureau, for example, investigates computer fraud, child pornography, theft of intellectual property, and worldwide computer intrusions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI has responded to threats to public safety posed by violent extremist groups, both domestic and international, tirelessly working to prevent crimes of terrorism against Americans at home and abroad. Their accomplishments are nothing less than extraordinary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mr. Speaker, these accomplishments have not been without a tragic cost. Since its inception, 34 FBI special agents have made the ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in the line of service. Every day, FBI special agents face the risks and endure the hardships to make our Nation safe. They truly personify the Bureau's motto: Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is fitting that we congratulate the men and women of the FBI on the 100th anniversary of the Bureau. We honor their heroic commitment and sacrifices and thank them for their past and continued efforts to keep America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Gohmert, the sponsor of the resolution, the committee chairman, Mr. Conyers, and the committee ranking member, Mr. Smith, for their leadership on this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague on a bipartisan basis to recognize that in the 100 years since President Theodore Roosevelt created the FBI out of basically an assemblage of Secret Service agents and detectives, what we have done is we have grown 1,000-fold in the number of agents. Clearly today with 30,000 employees, you ask how large has the task of the FBI grown. It has grown 1,000-fold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether in fact it was taking on public corruption throughout this last 100 years or taking on racketeering, white collar crime, taking on the rubble of the Oklahoma City bombing and finding out who the true perpetrators were and bringing them to justice, or going after wrongdoing by the most hidden and most influential of corporate America, the FBI has spread out to do its job and do it well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bureau, in fact, has taken the next step since September 11 when its primary task became protecting us from another terrorist attack like the one we experienced in New York, in Washington, and Pennsylvania. Those attacks made it very clear that this elite agency had to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today more than ever the FBI agents who are spread throughout the world in every embassy and in locations not even known to this body, they deal with counterterrorism in a way that no other agency can. Working hand-in-hand with overseas entities who have the charge for that, they make it their business to ensure that that foreign terrorism doesn't become an American tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No other group is so prepared to recognize the needs of America and the civil rights of America. The FBI has been a critical tool for President after President to enforce our civil rights laws often against the powerful, even against governors and other elected officials who chose not to recognize the importance of the U.S. Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI has never been a partisan organization and has, in fact, served each and every administration in a way that we today commemorate and appreciate so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, Mr. Speaker, for the first 90-plus years, the FBI was important. After September 11, 2001, the FBI's expanded role is vital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I urge the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
