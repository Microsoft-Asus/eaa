  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the College Student Relief Act, legislation that will cut interest rates in half over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We live in an information-driven world where a college education is more vital than ever. Yet financial barriers will prevent millions of American high school graduates from realizing their full potential and getting the  education that they need. This legislation will help middle- and working-class families afford to send their children to college at a time when the cost of college, particularly in Arizona, is skyrocketing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average subsidized loan debt for tens of thousands of students in my home State of Arizona is around $15,000, a staggering amount for someone entering the workforce. This new act will save students in Arizona an average of $4,700, a substantial difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must focus on preparing young Americans like those we have in the gallery today to be competitive in this 21st century global economy. Ensuring access to higher education is critical. This is a goal that is supported by the American people.</paragraph>
