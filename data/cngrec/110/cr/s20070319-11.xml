    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to remind the Senate that not only are brave men and women serving their countries overseas, but they are serving here at home, too. That service can end in tragedy, even on our own soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such an incident occurred last Thursday, March 15, 2007, near Cotton City, NM. I am sad to report that on that day, two Border Patrol agents assigned to the Lordsburg, NM, border patrol station were killed in the line of duty in a vehicular accident. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of Agent Ramon Nevarez, Jr., and Agent David Tourscher for their loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agent Nevarez is survived by his wife, Bonnie, his mother Juana, his sister Viridiana, and his brother Ryan. Agent Tourscher is survived by his father Gary and his mother Jeanne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Border security is one of our first lines of defense in the United States. An important part of that security is the men and women who are willing to serve on the front lines of our borders as Border Patrol agents. Agent Nevarez and Agent Tourscher were two such brave men, and I know the Senate joins me in thanking their families for the service of those two men.</paragraph>
