  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Terry Erickson, a man who has dedicated his life's work to helping children. Terry has tirelessly served western Wisconsin youth for over 40 years, mainly as the executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater La Crosse, a place I proudly called my second home while growing up on the north side of La Crosse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 100 years, the Boys and Girls Club of America has been fostering an environment of hope and opportunity for all children. In addition to promoting character development and educational progress, the club creates a safe environment so kids can simply play and enjoy themselves. In fact, some of my fondest childhood memories are a result of my participation in the La Crosse club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when many temptations existed in our neighborhoods for children and when there were plenty of opportunities for us to get into trouble, I found the club to be a safe haven for me and many other students for playing sports or just hanging out with our friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the creation of the Boys and Girls Club of Greater La Crosse in 1966, Terry has been a champion for youth programming and a father-like figure for many of us. Terry's devotion to the club's goal of inspiring all young people to realize their full potential is unrivaled. It is this passion and enthusiasm that has resulted in unprecedented growth for the organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Terry's leadership, the Boys and Girl Club of Greater La Crosse has flourished, growing from a small organization into one of the premier clubs throughout the country. The organization has expanded to six different locations, including a partnership with Viterbo University. Recently, Terry's university president, Bill Medlandis, and the Mathy family's dedication to this partnership resulted in the Amie L. Mathy Center, a club located on the campus of Viterbo University that enriches academic  support for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of lives Terry has positively affected throughout the years is impossible to quantify. I know my two boys have greatly benefited from their experiences with the club and from Terry's selfless example. Because of Terry's guidance, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater La Crosse has created a haven for youth and a sense of community in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terry simply brings out the best in people, whether they are young children and students who benefited from the club's many activities, or the countless adults who have volunteered their time to make the La Crosse club one of the premier models in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been said that great teachers enjoy a special immortality because their influence never stops radiating. I just hope that upon his retirement, Terry appreciates the wonderful teaching that he has done and the countless lives that he has influenced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to count myself as one of Terry's products, and I am even prouder to call him my friend. Although Terry's service and commitment to the children of the La Crosse area will be deeply missed upon his retirement, the solid foundation he has laid for the club will empower children for decades to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate my childhood friend and classmate Kevin Johnston, who was chosen to take over for Terry at the club. I couldn't imagine a better selection, given Kevin's history with the club, his passion for youth of our community and his close relationship with Terry throughout the years. I know Kevin will excel in his new position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Terry for his unyielding service and dedication to the community. As in any lengthy undertaking, Terry's service to our children required tremendous personal time and sacrifice by himself and his entire family. That's why, on behalf of all the children in the La Crosse area, I would like to thank Terry, Sue and their entire family for the impact that they have had in the La Crosse community. I wish Terry and Sue all the best as they close this chapter in their lives and begin a new  one. But knowing Terry, I am sure the best interests of our youth will be close at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Terry. Thank you for a job well done. We all wish you Godspeed.</paragraph>
