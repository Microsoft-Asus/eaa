    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank one of my constituents, Pastor Eric W. Jorgensen of St. Stephen's Reformed Episcopal Church in Eldersburg, Maryland, for serving as a guest chaplain of the House of Representatives and providing us a beautiful prayer before we begin our work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a tradition begun by Benjamin Franklin that has been followed ever since by the House of Representatives and the Senate. Benjamin Franklin, then 82 years of age, rose during a moment of crisis during our Constitutional Convention. This is part of what he said: "In the days of our contest with Great Britain when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for divine protection. I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of  this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. If a sparrow cannot fall without his notice, can a Nation rise without his aid?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we begin to proceed to any other business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Franklin, for this precedent. Thank you, Pastor Jorgensen, for helping to continue this great tradition.</paragraph>
