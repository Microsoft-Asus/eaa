  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the House today revisits the subject of the industrial loan corporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Industrial loan corporations were created early in the last century as a kind of a niche at a time when it was felt that banks did not adequately serve working people, people of lower incomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress dealt with the situation of banking reform in the 1980s, Congress decided to limit this form to six States, which now have the right to issue industrial loan charters, and recognize that the general business of banking was now being carried out in a way that did not require these niche banks, which Congress did not want to at that time wipe out banks that had been appropriately established under existing law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it's clear that they were regarded as a somewhat nonconforming use. There are people today who talk about what a good thing the industrial loan corporations are. None of them, however, seem to me to have shown the courage of their convictions, because those who believe that the industrial loan corporation should continue to flourish and grow, as will happen if we don't pass the bill, ought to be abolishing that restriction that says only six States can issue those charters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot think of any other financial instrument of which we have general approval where only six States are allowed to charter them. People who genuinely believe in the ILCs are the ones who ought to be pushing legislation. They do not. They implicitly accept the fact that they are an exception to a general principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The particular general principle to which they are an exception is the one which we have affirmed recently when we did the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill, namely that banking and commerce should be separate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me be very clear. If an entity that is in the manufacturing business or the retail business or any other business wants to get into financing its purchases, or even wants to lend money to people, they wouldn't be affected by this as long as they were willing to forgo deposit insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here because if you become an official bank, as ILCs can be to this extent, you get various benefits from the Federal Government, including deposit insurance. So this is not the Federal  Government intruding on purely private business decisions, it is the Federal Government saying, look, we have set up the system of deposit insurance. We have set up other things that apply to banks. We want to restrict those services to entities which are only  in the banking business. We do not want people who have as their primary business a manufacturer or wholesale or retail sales also dealing with banking. We think that is an unwise mixture. We think that the decisions that are made that we want to insure through the depository insurance system ought to be made purely on the banking aspects of this and not because the bank will make money on the side from where the purchase goes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, people have asked, why this legislation now? The answer is that for a variety of reasons, I am not fully aware of why, this situation changed drastically in the last few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ILCs, as they exist today, are not a problem. No one is talking about abolishing them. In the State of Utah, where they are most important, and where there continues to be strong support for them, there is opposition to them even in some of the other States that have the right to charter them, the estimate we received from the Utah bank supervisor was that 93 percent of the assets of ILCs meet the test that we would apply here in this bill to everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That test, by the way, is the one that we took out of Gramm-Leach-Bliley; namely, that to be in the banking business, you have to be at least 85 percent a financial institution, though we do recognize there will be some incidentals. Ninety-three percent of the Utah ILCs meet this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is over the last few years, a number of large manufacturing and commercial entities have decided that they would like to get into the ILC business. So people have said to us, why are you upsetting the status quo? We are not. Here, to be honest, we are preserving, we think, the status quo, which is the principle of the separation of banking, commerce, a banking system which exists under that rubric and a small niche for some banks which, for historical reasons, were allowed not necessarily  to follow this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's changing the status quo is the application from a number of large entities, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, many others, to get into the ILC business. We believe that does not really reflect what Congress intended in the 1980s. It's not illegal under current law, but we think that Congress did not anticipate then that large commercial and manufacturing entities would seek substantially to broaden the ILC approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were people who disagreed with us that we should preserve the distinction between banking and commerce. I asked them, where is that bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, those who would support by not changing the law a broad expansion of the ILCs are the ones who are seeking drastic change in our banking laws. They are, in effect, saying, you know, this distinction between banking and commerce you make is arbitrary, it has been outdated, let's get rid of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the way to get rid of that is for people to bring forward a bill. I can promise them as chairman of the Financial Services Committee, we will have a hearing, we will consider it. But let them bring forward a bill, and let's do that as a conscious decision of the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will oppose it, I think most Members will, which is probably why they don't want to bring it forward. But let's not do it in a kind of a back-door way by the expansion of what had been intended to be a residual niche kind of banking. This bill today would say that going forward, it doesn't wipe out existing entities, but going forward, ILC charters will only be granted to those that are at least 85 percent financial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to give my thanks to the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission, Chairman Bair. They have been put in a tough situation, because the law theoretically allows them to create an infinite number of new ILCs with no respect whatsoever for the banking and commerce distinction. Once this House passed a bill on the subject, although it did not pass the Senate, a phrase one often hears, the FDIC at our request has imposed a moratorium on new ILC charters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the FDIC is a law-abiding organization. Chairwoman Bair has an appropriate understanding of the role of the regulatory body in a democratic system. She will not forever maintain a moratorium, nor should she. What she did was, quite appropriately, give Congress the chance to legislate. We are beginning that process today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that we will pass the bill, that it will go to the Senate and they will pass something, and we will be able to work out legislation which will essentially preserve the distinction between banking and commerce. The necessity for us to act now is that if we do not act, the status quo will be greatly transformed, and the distinction we have long maintained in our law between banking and commerce, instead of admitting a fairly small exception where six States can do it, and where even in the  State where it is most prominent only 7 percent of the assets under this form are the exception, we will then see a general erosion. Erosion may understate it; a general abolition of the line between banking and commerce. We do not think that is appropriate, and passing this bill is the way to stop it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400150" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Frank for all his leadership on this issue, not just in this session, but in previous sessions, and also thank Ranking Member Spencer Bachus for his consistent support of the principles embodied in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank and I have cosponsored meaningful reform of the ILC charter option for a number of years now. We have gotten a bill, passed the House twice, it died in the Senate. I think this year, though, the third time may be the charm. I think we have substantially more support for this legislation in the Senate than in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it's available in only a handful of States, the ILC charter is the last loophole remaining for commercial firms wishing to engage in full-service banking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While a majority of current commercial owners of industrial banks refrain from using all the banking powers available to them, the broad ILC charter does allow for a complete mixing of banking and commerce, which I and other objective observers, such as Alan Greenspan, Chairman Ben Bernanke and others, consider to be financially unwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trend in Congress over the past several decades has been one of removing loopholes and exceptions in the bank law. We did it most recently in 1987 and in 1999, and the trend is clear: If you want to engage in full-service banking, you must become a bank or a thrift holding company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chartering an ILC in Utah is really your only option to make an end run around our bank laws, and the secret is out. ILC assets have grown more than 3,500 percent over the past decade. Applications for new ILCs look nothing like they did 80 years ago when this charter was created. States such as California, Maryland and others have taken notice of this alarming trend in ILC applications and have installed roadblocks to an extension of the charter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State action alone is insufficient, however. It's time that Congress address this policy concern, using the time which was wisely given to us by the FDIC-imposed moratorium. I also want to commend Chairman Bair and the FDIC for listening to the concerns of Congress and imposing that moratorium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Should Congress fail to send <bill type="h" number="698">H.R. 698</bill> to the President, we will be increasingly in danger of creating a parallel banking system to that which we have now and which has served the country very well. Both financial and commercial firms will look to this industrial bank option as a way to escape the rules that apply to everybody else. The banking system is well served by the different charter options available to them, but the universe in which an industrial bank can operate is more expansive than  any other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is poor public policy. Simply saying that since no ILC has yet taken full advantage, that Congress shouldn't act, is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are currently in a time of banking stability. Up until recently the FDIC had gone a record 952 days without a bank failure. But I don't like to think about the type of hit that the deposit insurance fund would have taken,  and the hit that taxpayers would have taken, if Enron had had an industrial bank prior to their collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill is a combination of significant bipartisan effort undertaken by myself and Chairman Frank to strike a balance between protecting those ILCs already in existence and preventing any further widening of this loophole by commercial firms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list of supporters for this reform measure is long and growing. We have 145 cosponsors of this measure to date, and the other body has already begun its deliberations of an identical bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to sincerely thank Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and their staff for the hard work on this bill, and urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson), a former member of our committee with whom many of us disagree but who, representing the State of Utah, has been a very staunch and articulate defender of a form of banking which is very important in his State.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400255" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Frank for his good work. I have great respect for Chairman Frank, and I have great respect for my colleague Mr. Gillmor. On this particular issue, I respectfully have a different point of view, but I do understand the time and effort that has gone into looking at this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important to note that when we look at legislation, we often are trying to solve problems and achieve progress. That is what Congress does, and my concern here is this is legislation that is a solution in search of the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We already have a number of banks that have been chartered with commercial parents, and we have a track record of regulation of this type of institution that is a stellar track record. Quite frankly, I think the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC, and the State of Utah, which regulates these particular banks, has a great track record. So I fear that we have moved down a path where we said, "Oh, gee, these things could happen; therefore, let's stop this industry from moving in the  direction that it has been moving."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important for us to show concern and make sure we don't go down a path that could have negative implications, but in this case where we have already had a number of banks chartered and a track record that is so solid and none of these potential problems have manifested themselves, I question whether Congress should be moving in this direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this debate has moved along, we have also said, well, what about the auto companies? Maybe we should carve out an exemption for them. What about the ones that already exist? Like Target already has one. We need to cut out an exemption for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you start to slice and dice this industry and allow certain exemptions here and there, that calls into question the basic premise of if there really is a problem to have commercial ownership of this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will close with just one other point of fact. I noted in the hearing before the Financial Services Committee a couple weeks ago a comment by one of the witnesses was made that I have heard periodically throughout this debate. They said: My gosh, what if Enron and WorldCom had one of these? Where would we be then?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And my answer is: Based on the track record of this industry, I would like to think that, while those parent companies had their financial difficulties, the subsidiary bank would have been fine. We have examples right now where the parent company, like Conseco, went into bankruptcy, and their industrial loan company based in Utah was shielded from all those financial problems and, quite frankly, sold at a premium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that shows that the style of regulation, which is different, it is a different style of regulation called "bottom up" or "bank centric" regulation, it shows that type of regulation has worked, it has protected against transgressions, and I think that track record is something we need to keep in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as this issue percolates along, it is clear this bill is going to pass the House today. I suspect the Senate may have a different type of bill as well. And as this issue perks along, I just encourage everyone to keep an open mind about looking at the actual track record, understanding the magnitude of the potential problems, but also keeping in mind that more choices for consumers, greater efficiency for our economy, those are good things, too, and they ought to be balanced in this overall  debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I really thank the chairman for giving me some time when I am speaking out. Quite frankly, I am going to vote against the bill, but I appreciate him giving me time to speak today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I respect all my colleagues that worked on this, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on the adjusted loan bank issue in the future.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400150" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me commend the gentleman from Utah for an articulate presentation. He is protecting the hometown industry, and there is nothing wrong with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this bill, though, involves something much broader than that; and it involves a very important financial principle that has been recognized for decades, which is a separation of banking and commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Really, the fact that some of these ILCs have not utilized all the powers they could have isn't really an argument against this bill. Because the business plan of some of the new industrial companies trying to take over ILCs, Home Depot is a great example, is totally different than what the history in the past has been. So that history I don't think is really relevant to what this bill is aimed at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that having been said, I am very pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to the ranking member, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I really believe that we do need enhanced regulatory supervisions over the ILCs, and this legislation does that. The Federal Reserve and other Federal regulators have urged us to enhance the regulation, and that is what this does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also does two things; and every year that we wait to pass this, it becomes a bigger problem. But we grandfather the existing ILCs. If we had done this bill 2 or 3 years ago, we would have had much fewer of these and we wouldn't have the problems that we have today, talking about, well, this commercial firm has one, this commercial doesn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it was through no fault of the chairman of the full committee. Mr. Frank, when he was ranking member, pushed this very hard as a solution to this problem, as did the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Gillmor, and I want to commend both of them for their hard work over the past several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to particularly commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank. He has really made this a collaborative effort. It has been a bipartisan effort; and I hope the bill, because of that, is a better bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we are going to have a good vote here. I do think, because it is a bipartisan effort and it is a compromise, that we will have, hopefully, better success in not only passing this bill out of the House but seeing it ultimately enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These ILCs, and they are ILCs, industrial loan companies, now they are industrial bank holding. This is the Industrial Bank Holding Company Act, because they really have evolved into bank holding companies; and what these started out primarily as is just a small loan company where industrial employees were able to borrow money. It is very similar to a credit union. The only difference is they didn't join as members. They just borrowed money, because they really didn't have access to a commercial  bank at that time, and that was the whole reason for these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman said and as the subcommittee Chair said, all of these exist in six States. The vast majority of the assets of ILCs are chartered in Utah; California and Nevada being the other States that have significant numbers of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the subcommittee Chair has said, these things have grown 3,500 percent just since we started focusing on this.  It is really growing out of control. And what it does, we made a policy decision several years ago in this Congress that we would not allow commercial firms to operate banks, and this will really enforce that policy decision that we made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As they have grown in size and nature and complexity, several not only regulatory but policy issues have been presented, not only to the Congress, but to the regulators. One of the concerns, as the subcommittee Chair and the chairman have both referred to, is a concern over mixing banking and commerce, which is really not what the American financial system is all about. Japan and other systems have allowed a mixing of commerce and banking, and we are evolving, but they have run into problems.  We would like to avoid those problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An exemption in the current law permits any type of company, including a commercial firm, to acquire an ILC in six States. We want to close that loophole. We want to stop that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me conclude by saying I do have one concern, and I am going to have a colloquy with the chairman in a moment. But I am concerned that this bill, and it is not intended and I know the chairman has said previously we hope to address this in the Senate or in conference, but I am concerned that it may discriminate against our domestic automobile manufacturing dealers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I say that is most automobile companies today, including the large foreign automobile manufacturers, have set up ILCs. General Motors has set up an ILC. But Chrysler and Ford do not have ILCs. And, as drafted today, the bill would allow the foreign automobile manufacturers as well as GM, and I am going to clarify that in the colloquy, to continue their ILCs. However, Ford and Chrysler, or DaimlerChrysler, which may end up to be Chrysler, does not have an ILC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned not only that that is a disadvantage to the automobile companies but to the Nation's dealers that sell Ford and Chrysler products. People are going into this every day, they are thinking ILCs give them a competitive advantage, and I don't want to see Chrysler and Ford shut out of having an opportunity to have this advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the process moves forward, I would like to work with both the chairman and the ranking member to ensure the legislation does not create an unlevel playing field that harms our domestic automobile industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I would like to pose a question to the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the committee reported bill, Chairman Frank, a number of firms that already controlled industrial banks before January 29, 2007, are grandfathered from the new prohibition on control of industrial banks by commercial firms. The grandfathered firms that control a particular industrial bank are subject to a disposition agreement with the FDIC that is affected by the outcome of this legislation. Under the agreement, the FDIC has the power to waive the disposition requirement, depending  on the state of the law, in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question is whether it is the committee's intention that the decision to grandfather these firms supercedes this particular prior agreement and makes a waiver unnecessary, provided the grandfathered firms abide by all of the limitations imposed on grandfathered firms and operate under the supervision of the appropriate Federal supervisory agency.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield to me, let me say, and I want to pay tribute to members of the staffs on both sides, Mr. Paese and Mr. Yi on my side here, who did a lot of negotiating. There are a lot of regulators involved here, the FDIC as the primary regulator, but the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Comptroller, and we did the best we could to try and not have this be a means of changing existing relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I can assure the gentleman from Alabama that he has precisely stated our intent. When we grandfathered these firms in this bill, it was our purpose and is our purpose to let them continue to operate the existing industrial banks under the limitations of the bill and under the supervision of each grandfathered firm's appropriate supervisory agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope that would respond to the question. It is our intention essentially to ratify the existing arrangements by law, which would, of course, preclude the need for a waiver if the law is clear about what it does.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Chairman, your response does indeed clarify the situation, and I thank you for doing that. And I again thank you and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gillmor) for their work on this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to join with you. You have both praised Chairman Bair, and I think she has done an exceptional job of trying to sort through this difficult situation. And I would also like to commend the OTS and the Federal Reserve for working a compromise on some of the supervisory questions that were presented by this bill. Late last week, they came to an agreement between themselves.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield. With some encouragement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, and I appreciate that encouragement; and I know they do, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I again commend the chairman. I think this is a very good bill that deserves the support of all the membership.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400150" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to respond to my good friend from Utah. He made an interesting point which is, well, if these are terrible, why don't you abolish them? That, of course, becomes a Catch-22. I guarantee you that if we had proposed in fact to abolish or severely restrict existing ones, he would have been justifiably a lot less happy than he is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Congress made a decision. We don't always make the best decisions when we look back; we often make good decisions, but not perfect ones. We believe it would be unfair to undo what was originally done by law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note again that even in the State of Utah, which has become the primary focal point for the industrial loan corporations, 93 percent of the entities functioning as industrial loan corporations in Utah would be unaffected by this bill. They would be able to expand because they meet the 85 percent financial test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to the others, we believe that it is those who have finally figured out the potential of the industrial loan corporation going forward who are trying to change things. People have said to us, well, there's been no problem. Why are you doing this? Well, for once, maybe not once, let's not be too self-denigratory, we're doing this to get ahead of the problem. Yes, that's precisely the case. The ILCs have not caused problems. It is the, I believe, overwhelming view of people here and people who  have watched the banking business and who believe in the separation of banking and commerce that if we don't act, we will see some problems. So that is what we are doing here. And I hope that this bill passes with a large margin, and we can pretty soon engage with our colleagues in the Senate about putting a final product on the desk of the President.</paragraph>
