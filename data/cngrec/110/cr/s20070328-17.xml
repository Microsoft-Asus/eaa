    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my privilege to call to the attention of my colleagues a great Ohioan and distinguished Tuskegee Airman, Howard Arthur Tibbs, who this week will be posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been written about the valiant service and tremendous bravery of these African-American men during World War II. Collectively the Airmen flew over 15,000 sorties and 1,500 missions in their legendary P-51 Mustangs. They were awarded two Presidential Unit Citations, 744 Air Medals, 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and numerous individual bronze and silver stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this simple listing of their military accomplishments does not capture the true breadth of their commitment and sacrifice to this country. Not only did they greatly contribute to the Allies' defeat of the Axis Powers, but they did so within a highly segregated military. It has been stated that "These airmen fought two wars--one against a military force overseas and the other against racism at home and abroad."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Howard Arthur Tibbs exemplified the qualities for which the Tuskegee Airmen are so admired. At the age of 24, the Salem, OH native enlisted into the service of his country at Fort Hayes in Columbus, OH. He fought bravely and served honorably under tremendously challenging conditions. Our State and our Nation are indebted to him and his fellow airmen for their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A window into the character of Howard Arthur Tibbs is provided by the advice he gave his children. "Give each day your best," he told them, "and the best is bound to come back to you." Howard Tibbs certainly gave his best to this country, and this country is right to recognize his bravery and accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I proudly celebrate the life and sacrifice of this great Ohioan on the occasion of his posthumous award of the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
