    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="1462">H.R. 1462</bill>, as introduced by our colleague Congressman MARK UDALL of Colorado and amended by the Committee on Natural Resources, is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the implementation of the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Species in the Central and Lower Platte River Basin and to modify the Pathfinder Dam and Reservoir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1462">H.R. 1462</bill>, as amended, would secure benefits for four target species and their associated habitats while also providing Endangered Species Act compliance for existing and certain new water-related activities in the Platte River basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1462">H.R. 1462</bill>, as amended, also authorizes the modification of Pathfinder Dam and Reservoir as is required by a legal settlement and is the key part of the water devoted to recovery implementation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this program is the result of years and years of negotiation and compromise between water users and environmentalists and should be seen as a model for dealing with endangered species conflicts. I congratulate my Democratic colleague from Colorado, the Honorable Representative MARK UDALL, for his hard work on this legislation. And I strongly urge my colleagues to stand in support of this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1462">H.R. 1462</bill> stems from endangered species conflicts along the Platte River. As a result of lawsuits and the real threat of water and power infrastructure being shut down over endangered species conflicts, the Federal Government, three States, water and power users, and environmental organizations came together on the Platte River Recovery Program, and this legislation implements part of that program. The result is that existing water and power infrastructure is protected while a collaborative and  far-reaching program to help save four different species begins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since this program is contingent upon Federal appropriations and a State can opt out, the governance committee charged with implementing the program has the enormous responsibility of keeping all stakeholders together, conversing with affected parties, communities and landowners on land and water issues and finding real results. Congress will continue to have oversight on this program to see if it is being run effectively and efficiently. This legislation, if implemented properly, can be a win-win  for both the people and species of the Platte River basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, let me just emphasize again there were so many interests at work here. I don't know if anybody is totally thrilled with the result, but it seemed to be an appropriate way to bring what could be  done together to come about with a result that will require oversight, will require monitoring. But under the circumstances to keep things from being totally shut down, we would encourage our colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which I introduced earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my thanks to Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Don Young, Subcommittee Chairwoman Napolitano, and Subcommittee Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers for making it possible for the bill to come before the House of Representatives today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will authorize the Interior Department to participate in the implementation of the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Species in the Central and Lower Platte River Basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I consider myself fortunate to have the honor of introducing it, and am gratified that it is cosponsored by my Colorado colleagues, Representatives DeGette, Salazar, and Perlmutter, as well as the entire House delegations of our neighboring States of Wyoming and Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its purpose is to continue a cooperative effort involving the Federal Government and the States of Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming (and other entities and groups) aimed at recovery of endangered species in ways that will not involve the creation of Federal water rights or requiring the grant of water rights to Federal entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the result of 14 years of negotiations that culminated last year when the Governors of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska joined Secretary Kempthorne in signing the agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, initial implementing steps have begun and the President's budget for fiscal 2008 has requested the initial funding for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program is modeled after a somewhat similar program for the recovery of several endangered species of fish in the upper basin of the Colorado River. I have strongly supported that program because it has enabled us in Colorado and other participating States to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act while allowing continued development and use of water for other purposes as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While such arrangements are not easy to work out, I think doing so is far better than alternative approaches that are more likely to be marked by conflicts or litigation. So, I think all concerned in the negotiation of this important agreement are to be congratulated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill that deserves the support of the entire House, and I urge its approval. For the benefit of our colleagues, I am attaching information about the background of the Recovery Program addressed by the bill:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1997, the States of Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming have worked with water users, conservation groups and the Interior Department to develop ways to allow continued water use and development along the Platte River to comply with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In late 2006 the States and the Interior Department signed the final agreement for a basin-wide Recovery Program to benefit three endangered species (interior least tern, whooping crane, and pallid sturgeon) and one threatened species (piping plover) referred to as the "target species."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal government is to pay half the cost--and the bill authorizes appropriation of those funds. Total authorization would be $157.14 million plus any needed inflation adjustments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Program is designed to secure defined benefits for the target species and their associated habitats while also providing ESA compliance for existing and certain new water-related activities in the Platte River basin. It is to be incremental, with the First Increment coming over the next 13 years. It would be implemented by a Governance Committee with membership including representatives of the three states, the Interior Department, water users, and environmental groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Program is designed to provide ESA compliance for existing and certain new water-related activities throughout the Platte River basin upstream of the confluence of the Platte and the Loup Rivers (in Nebraska), the land acquisition and management for the target bird species will occur in the central Platte River region (Lexington to Chapman, Nebraska), and Program water activities would be designed to provide benefits for the target bird species in the central Platte River region and  for the pallid sturgeon in the lower Platte River region (below the confluence with the Elkhorn River).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Program has three main elements--(1) increasing stream flows in the central Platte River during relevant periods through retiming and water conservation/supply projects; (2) enhancing, restoring and protecting habitat lands for the target bird species; and (3) accommodating certain new water-related activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Program will achieve these results through an adaptive management approach employing scientific monitoring and research to evaluate the management actions and species habitat needs. These elements will be implemented according to underlying principles that require interests in land to be acquired only from willing participants and avoid increasing tax burdens to local citizens by paying taxes or their equivalent on Program lands. Program lands will be held by a land holding entity (rather  than by the Federal or state governments) and will be managed under a "good neighbor" policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Program's long-term objective for water is to provide sufficient water to and through the central Platte River habitat area to assist in improving and maintaining habitat for the target species using incentive based water projects. During the First Increment (13 years) the Program's objective is to retime and improve flows in the central Platte River to reduce shortages to target flows by an average of 130,000 to 150,000 acre-feet per year at Grand Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the First Increment, the Program's objective is to protect, restore, and maintain 10,000 acres of habitat. The Program's long-term objective for land is to acquire land interests, restore where appropriate, and maintain and manage approximately 29,000 acres of suitable habitat along the central Platte River between Lexington and Chapman, Nebraska. Land acquired during the Program's First Increment will be credited to this long-term objective as will certain lands that meet criteria established  by the Governance Committee but are managed by other entities such as environmental organizations or utility and irrigation districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One Program purpose is to mitigate the adverse impacts of certain new water-related activities through the implementation of state and Federal depletions plans. This will allow continued growth and water development to occur in the Platte River basin along with improving conditions for the target species.</paragraph>
