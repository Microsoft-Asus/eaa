    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Hawaii?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3352">H.R. 3352</bill> was introduced by my colleague and our good friend from Alaska (Mr. Young), and it amends the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act to authorize the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expand the use of hydrographic data and hydrographic services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Coast Survey, which is within NOAA's National Ocean Service, conducts hydrographic surveys measuring the depth and bottom configuration of bodies of water. The Hydrographic Services Review Panel, a quality assurance program authorized in 2002, suggested several recommendations to improve NOAA's hydrographic services. Strengthening the emergency response and recovery capabilities were among the recommendations suggested. <bill type="h" number="3352">H.R. 3352</bill> addresses these recommendations directly, and meets  homeland security and maritime domain awareness needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend our friend Congressman DON YOUNG for introducing this bill, and urge all Members to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3352">H.R. 3352</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hydrographic surveys and shoreline mapping activities provide data to produce accurate nautical charts. Many vessels from large container ships and oil tankers to the smaller commercial fishing vessels and recreational boaters rely on nautical charts to safely navigate U.S. waterways. There is currently a backlog in the survey work, making many nautical charts out of date. <bill type="h" number="3352">H.R. 3352</bill> will reauthorize the program that supports hydrographic surveys and shoreline mapping activities, and continue  the efforts to provide all users with accurate nautical charts. I urge an "aye" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3352">H.R. 3352</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
