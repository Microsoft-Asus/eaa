    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Republicans have now had 2 weeks to sift through the rhetoric and reality of the bipartisan children's health insurance bill that the President vetoed. When the President vetoed the bill, he said it was a step toward government-run health care. Surely, he can't believe that. If he understood the program, he would know that it is a Federal-State partnership to ensure that children have access to private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President also says that the bill attempts to expand the SCHIP program to upper middle class children who are not currently eligible. Again that is false. It does not expand the program. There are now about 12 million children who are eligible for SCHIP. Today we are reaching 6 million of those kids. Our legislation would allow us to reach an additional 4 million children who are already eligible for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President also says that our bill is too expensive. But he ignores the fact that it is fully paid for. And he is asking for $190 billion more to fund the occupation of Iraq. Even if the President does not make children his priority, let us do so by overriding his veto on Thursday. Republicans have had 2 weeks to realize that the President's reasons for vetoing this bill simply do not add up. So they should join us in overriding the veto.</paragraph>
