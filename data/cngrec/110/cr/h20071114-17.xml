    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my congratulations to one of my constituents who's dedicated his adult life toward protecting the men and women of Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to congratulate Les Braunns of Springdale on his promotion to the rank of major in the Arkansas State Police. A 28-year veteran trooper, Major Braunns was most recently the commanding officer of Troop L, where he earned the respect and friendship of the men he commanded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the men of Troop L, Major Braunns always led his men by example, and led his men from the front, never asking a trooper to perform a task he was unwilling to perform himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His men pointed to the most recent example of his leadership from an incident in July when the Hell's Angels descended on my district for their annual get-together. Then Captain Braunns marched into a group of 300 and told them, "You can police yourselves, or we can do it for you." The State police kept their word and so did the Hell's Angels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Major Braunns on his promotion, and I thank him and appreciate all that he's done for the State of Arkansas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
