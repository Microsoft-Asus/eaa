    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the Space Foundation's 25th anniversary. Throughout this time, space has become an integral part of our national security and everyday life. The Space Foundation has been instrumental in our advancements in space, and I am proud to recognize their 25th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The Space Foundation is a nonprofit organization which was founded in 1983 by a small group of innovative individuals in Colorado Springs, CO. It began as an organization "to foster, develop and promote, among the citizens of the U.S. and among other people of the world, a greater understanding and awareness of the practical and theoretical utilization of space for the benefit of civilization and the fostering of a peaceful and prosperous world." They have certainly lived up to this creed  and have more than excelled in their promotion and edification of space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The Space Foundation is a leader in exploration and development. They work with all components of space including commercial, civil, and national security. The Foundation is regarded internationally as a leading space advocacy organization, and is a member of the U.S. Delegation to the United Nation's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The Space Foundation has recognized the need for increased attention to space education. Their one-of-a-kind program allocates resources and helps prepare teachers to not only teach children about space, but to excite them about space. They have connected with teachers in all 50 States as well as countries in Europe and Asia. Beyond the classroom, the Space Foundation seeks to raise awareness and involvement in community programs. They hold two of the three top conferences for space professionals  in the world: Strategic Space and Defense and the National Space Symposium. The National Space Symposium is the premier space policy and program forum in the world. It is a unique opportunity for interaction and discussion among the world's space community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> There is no question that space will continue to play an increasingly important strategic role in both technological advancement and national security. The Space Foundation will undoubtedly continue to play a major role in this arena. I commend the Space Foundation on their 25th anniversary, and wish them continued success in the future as they remain an invaluable advocate for space.</paragraph>
