  <narrative>THE NATIONAL CRITTENTON FOUNDATION -- (Senate - April 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2815">S2815</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in commemorating the 125th anniversary of the National Crittenton Foundation and the Crittenton Family of Agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 113 years, Florence Crittenton Services Inc. in Wheeling, WV has served thousands of teen mothers and their children as the State's only maternity home--one that is nationally recognized for its unique gender-responsive program. In recognition of its continuing contribution to the State, the State Journal recently named this innovative agency one of the "55 Good Things About West Virginia." The honor is well deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1895, Florence Crittenton Services Inc. first opened its doors to provide shelter and support for "wayward" women in crisis. Over the past century, it has evolved from being a group home and adoption agency to a nationally-accredited and respected therapeutic residential program that serves abused, neglected, and behaviorally-challenged girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among its many forward-thinking programs is Wellspring Family Services, a comprehensive, community-based behavioral health, parenting support and education service provider. Cradles to Crayons, a child care program for young mothers in care, provides a structured and safe environment for children while their parents complete their education and participate in therapeutic programming. This child care program continues today and serves the child care needs of Crittenton residents and community  members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grounded in its original mission to help children and families in need achieve self-sufficiency, all of the agency's programs pay close attention to the underlying challenges that keep young women from succeeding, including addiction, domestic violence, and sexual abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout its history, Florence Crittenton Services, Inc. has maintained a unique cooperative relationship with The National Crittenton Foundation. This partnership is based on founder Charles Crittenton's and Dr. Kate Waller Barrett's belief that the most effective way to address compelling national social issues was through a network of affiliated independent, local organizations supported by a national body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than a century after Charles Crittenton founded his first home, the National Crittenton Foundation is re-emerging as an active force for social change. The foundation and its agencies continue their work to break the cycles of intergenerational issues like teen pregnancy, violence and substance abuse through a mix of strength-based gender and culturally-specific services tailored to meet the needs of young girls in local communities. For years, I have worked to improve services and support  of needy children and families, and I have been proud to work with the Florence Crittenton Society in Wheeling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the National Crittenton Foundation and West Virginia's Florence Crittenton Services, Inc. come to Capitol Hill to celebrate 125 years of service to young women at risk and their children, I ask you to help me congratulate them on their achievements and thank them for their profound commitment to our children and our communities.</paragraph>
