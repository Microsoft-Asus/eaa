  <narrative>(u) Veterans means persons as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#xA7;2108(1), or any superseding legislation.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to implement section 4(c). In addition, section  4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are "the same as the most relevant substantive regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated to implement the statutory provisions referred to in paragraph (2)" of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and subchapter</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a qualification to the statutory obligation to issue regulations that are "the same as the most substantive regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive branch)", section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the Board to "determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be more effective for the implementation of the rights and protections under" section 4(c) of the  VEOA.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such regulations must take into account the fact that the Board does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. OPM's regulations are designed for  the competitive service (defined in 5 U.S.C. &#xA7;2102(a)(2)), which does not exist in the employing offices subject to this regulation. Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while providing no VEOA</narrative>
  <narrative>Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the Executive branch.</narrative>
  <narrative>Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions</narrative>
  <narrative>Sec. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.105.Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.106.Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 1.105. RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE. </narrative>
  <narrative>Subject to section 1.106, employing offices with covered employees or covered positions are responsible for making all veterans' preference determinations, consistent with the VEOA.</narrative>
  <narrative>Applicants for appointment to a covered position and covered employees may contest adverse veterans' preference determinations,  including any determination that a preference eligible applicant is not a qualified applicant, pursuant to sections 401-416 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. &#xA7;1401-1416, and provisions of law referred to therein; 206a(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. &#xA7;1401, 1316a(3); and the Office's Procedural Rules.</narrative>
  <narrative>Subpart C--Veterans' Preference in Appointments</narrative>

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO RESTRICTED POSITIONS. </narrative>
  <narrative>In each appointment action for the positions of custodian, elevator operator, guard, and messenger (as defined below and collectively referred to in these regulations as restricted covered positions) employing offices shall restrict competition to preference eligible applicants as long as qualified preference eligible applicants are available. The provisions of sections 1.109 and 1.110 below shall apply to the appointment of a preference eligible applicant to a restricted covered position. The  provisions of section 1.108 shall apply to the appointment of a preference eligible applicant to a restricted covered position, in the event that there is more than one preference eligible applicant for the position.</narrative>
  <narrative>Custodian--One whose primary duty is the performance of cleaning or other ordinary routine maintenance duties in or about a government building or a building under Federal control, park, monument, or other Federal reservation.</narrative>

The  term guard does not include law enforcement officer positions of the Capitol Police Board.</narrative>
  <narrative>Messenger--One whose primary duty is the supervision or performance of general messenger work (such as running errands, delivering messages, and answering call bells).</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Where an employing office has duly adopted a policy requiring the numerical scoring or rating of applicants for covered positions, the employing office shall add points to the earned ratings of those preference eligible applicants who receive passing scores in an entrance examination, in a manner that is proportionately comparable to the points prescribed in 5 U.S.C. &#xA7;3309. For example, five preference points shall be granted to preference eligible applicants in a 100-point system, one  point shall be granted in a 20-point system, and so on.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) In all other situations involving appointment to a covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' preference eligibility as an affirmative factor that is given weight in a manner that is proportionately comparable to the points prescribed in 5 U.S.C. &#xA7;3309 in the employing office's determination of who will be appointed from among qualified applicants.</narrative>
  <narrative>When considering applicants for covered positions in which experience is an element of qualification, employing offices shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an extension of time spent in the position in which the applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a combination of both methods. Employing offices shall credit time spent in the military service according to the method that will be of most benefit to the preference eligible applicant.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) for all experience material to the position for which the applicant is being considered, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he/she received pay therefor.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office shall waive:</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the preference eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the position;</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it has made a conditional offer of employment is preference eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. &#xA7;2108(3)(c) and who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the covered  position, the employing office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and to submit additional information to the employing office, within 15 days of the date of the notification. The director of the employing office may, by providing written notice to the preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a particular covered position, if necessary because of a need to fill the covered position immediately. Should the preference eligible applicant make</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. &#xA7;12101 et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. &#xA7;1302(a)(3).</narrative>
  <narrative>Subpart D--Veterans' preference in reductions in force</narrative>
  <narrative>Sec. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.111..Definitions applicable in reductions in force. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.112..Application of preference in reductions in force. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.113..Crediting experience in reductions in force. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.114..Waiver of physical requirements in reductions in force. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1.115..Transfer of functions. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 1.111. DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE. </narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees within a particular position or job classification, at or within a particular competitive area, as those terms are defined below.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing office's organizational structure, as determined by the employing office, in which covered employees compete for retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and geographical location, and it must include all employees within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area may consist of all or part of an employing office. The minimum competitive area is a department or  subdivision of the employing office within the local commuting area.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) Position classifications or job classifications are determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all covered positions within a competitive area that are in the same grade, occupational level or classification, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working conditions so that an employing office may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the position classification without  undue interruption.</narrative>
  <narrative>(d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with respect to the application of section 1.114 of these regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, the following shall apply:</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) "active service" has the meaning given it by section 101 of title 37;</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) "a retired member of a uniformed service" means a member or former member of a uniformed service who is entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service is considered a preference eligible only if</narrative>
  <narrative>(A) his/her retirement was based on disability--</narrative>
  <narrative>(i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or</narrative>
  <narrative>(ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war as defined by sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;</narrative>
  <narrative>(B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but not including periods of active duty for training; or</narrative>
  <narrative>(C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position to which this subchapter  applies and thereafter he/she continued to be so employed without a break in service of more than 30 days.</narrative>
  <narrative>The definition of "preference eligible" as set forth in 5 U.S.C &#xA7;2108 and section 1.102(o) of these regulations shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in determining an employee's qualifications for retention under section 1.114 of these regulations.</narrative>
  <narrative>H&amp;S Regs: (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. The term "reduction in force" does not encompass a termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon performance, conduct or other  grounds attributable to an employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to a change in party leadership or majority party status within the House of Congress where the employee is employed.</narrative>
  <narrative>C Reg: (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. The term "reduction in force" does not encompass a termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon performance, conduct or other  grounds attributable to an employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the employing office on a temporary basis.</narrative>
  <narrative>(f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by a covered employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered employee needs more than 90 days after  the reduction in force to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day</narrative>
  <narrative>Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, if any, covered employees within a particular group of competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' preference eligibility status in accordance with these regulations. In determining which covered employees will be retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such competing covered employees, regardless  of length of service or performance, provided that the preference eligible employee's performance has not been determined to be unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is a "disabled veteran" under section 1.102(h) above who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more and whose performance has not been determined to be unacceptable</narrative>
  <narrative>In computing length of service in connection with a reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit to preference eligible covered employees as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for the total length of time in active service in the armed forces;</narrative>

  <narrative>(a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in force:</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the position.</narrative>
