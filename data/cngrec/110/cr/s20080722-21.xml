  <narrative>125TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHURCHS FERRY, NORTH DAKOTA</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community in North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. On June 27 through June 29, the residents of Churchs Ferry celebrated their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Great Northern Rail Road town site was founded in 1886 and named for the ferry service operated by Irvine A. Church. Mr. Church moved his Church post office to the town on November 13, 1886, adopting the new name. To conform to new government spelling regulations the name was changed to Churchs Ferry on November 30, 1894.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although its population is small, Churchs Ferry serves as a testament to  hard work and determination. Even after a Federal buyout in 2000 relocated many residents of Churchs Ferry from the rising flood waters of Devils Lake, some residents remained. These 10 residents have persevered and worked extremely hard to keep Churchs Ferry alive. Paul Christenson is the mayor, mechanic, and mower of the community's 30 acres of grass and takes great pride in keeping  Churchs Ferry beautiful. Two new businesses have opened, including Gardendwellers Farm, which grows custom crops for wineries and restaurants and offers horticulture tours and workshops, and Water's Edge Dog Boarding kennel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Visitors who pass through Churchs Ferry still see that the street signs are up and can drive by city hall, the post office, Kat's Korral bar, Paul's Repair shop, the Zion Lutheran Church, a museum, the Masonic Temple and the former school's gym/kitchen/stage addition that was purchased by the school's alumni association. The 125th anniversary celebration started off Friday, June 27, with a 1-mile walk and concluded on Sunday with a polka church service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Churchs Ferry, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Churchs Ferry and all the other historic small towns of ND, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Churchs Ferry that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
