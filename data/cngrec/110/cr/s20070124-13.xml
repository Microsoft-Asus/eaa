  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from Tennessee for his support at this second look at waste amendment which I have offered. The Senator's arguments, as always, are extraordinarily cogent and logical. He makes the point--which I think is very valid, as a former Governor who had the line-item veto, which is a much stronger authority than what we have in this amendment--that this is important, managing the fiscal house, to making sure that items which get into legislation as  a result of being put in arbitrarily by some individual Member of Congress but which are not subject to the light of day in the traditional way--by being brought across the floor as individual items but, rather, are put into major pieces of legislation, sometimes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal, this fast-track rescission, which is what it really is, is not a partisan proposal. In fact, as proposed in my amendment, second look at waste, it would actually be primarily under the control of the next President. It has a 4-year window of activity and then it is sunsetted. By the time it would get into law, should it pass the Senate and then pass the House, it is likely that this President will only have, probably, a year and a half to use this authority, and then the next President,  whoever that President may be--maybe a Republican, maybe a Democrat--will have the authority to use this rescission ability for 2 1/2  years. So it is not partisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it was drafted, as the Senator from Tennessee noted, basically to mirror a proposal that was put forward by Senator Daschle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I have called this amendment daughter of Daschle. It is essentially the Daschle amendment as offered back in 1995, which was cosponsored by Senator Byrd. There are only two major changes--well, three major changes, and I have already said to those who have asked me that I am willing to adjust those changes to bring it even more in line with Daschle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the changes in this bill from the Daschle bill was that the President would have 300 days to send up his rescission notice. Some people have expressed concern that that gives the President the ability to use that rescission notice as a club over people's heads. The reason we gave the President 300 days in this amendment was we had reduced the number of rescission notices in the Daschle amendment. There were potentially 13 rescission actions available to the President, and in this amendment,  there are only 4 available to the President. Therefore, in the Daschle amendment, it was required that the rescission notice be sent up soon after the bill was signed. But, of course, with 13 different opportunities, it could go on all year long. We felt that since we were reducing it to four, we should give the President more leeway as to when he sent up those rescission notices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I can understand the argument. In fact, I accept the argument that maybe that is too much authority in the sense it gives the President too much leverage over the Congress. So when, I hope--I am using the term "when"--when this amendment comes forward in an amendable form, I will offer an amendment to reduce the 300 days back to 30 days. So the President would have to send up his rescission notices within 30 days of it being signed, or at least asking us to take a second look at it, and  that should adjust that problem and bring it directly in line, pretty much in line with what the Daschle amendment was originally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other area which was different from the Daschle amendment is the issue that deals with mandatory spending. Some people have said new mandatory spending--not existing programs, not existing veterans programs or farm programs or Medicare or Medicaid, but if there is a new mandatory program, that can also be subjected to the President asking for a second look at it. It has been argued by some on the other side that this would undermine the ability to reach a comprehensive settlement on entitlement  reform. That is really a straw argument. That argument has no legs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practical matter is, if a President reaches an agreement with the Congress on something as extraordinarily important as major entitlement reform, part of that agreement is going to be that the President signed off on it. So this argument of, well, but the President might come back and change it later on with a rescission notice really has no legs. It is just being made for the purpose of giving comfort to folks who believe they want to vote against this amendment. If people want to vote against  it, that is their right. But don't use that as an excuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment essentially does is it allows the Congress to fulfill its obligation to make sure that money which is sent by our taxpayers is spent effectively, honestly, appropriately, and without waste. And, it gives the executive branch a role in asking the question of Congress: Did you really mean to spend this money?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say, I have been here for a while--14 years in the Senate--and I have seen a lot of bills come across this floor which were fairly large, and when I took a look at them after I maybe had voted for it, I realized there were some things in them that I wished weren't in them. I didn't happen to vote for the highway bill which had the bridge to nowhere--the famous highway bill. But had I voted for it, I think I would have wanted to take a second look at some of the projects in that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same is true of a lot of our appropriations bills when we get to the end of the year and we haven't gotten our appropriations process completed effectively, so we lump 3 or 4 different appropriations bills, sometimes 5 or 6, occasionally 10, appropriations bills into 1 and we call it an Omnibus appropriations bill. Those bills tend to get items in them which have received no scrutiny, which are simply the result of an earmark for the purpose of accomplishing something which some Member of  the Senate or the House feels is appropriate but which one suspects, if the entire House or the Senate were to take a look at, we would say: Well, better to put that money toward reducing the deficit than toward spending the money in this specific area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill is, as I have said and as the Senator from Tennessee so eloquently said, a second look at waste. The purpose is to give us, the Congress, another tool to manage waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I wish it had come up last week because, quite honestly, I thought it was much more appropriate to last week's debate when we were debating earmarks and when about 50 percent of the debate time was spent on earmarks  because that is what it is really about. But it has now been put on this bill as a result of an agreement I reached with the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader. I respected his position. I admire his leadership. I didn't want to  create a situation where the lobbying bill got tied up forever over this issue, and the Senator from West Virginia said he would do that if I kept this amendment on the lobbying bill. So I agreed to put the amendment off and bring it forward at this time. So, hopefully, no one, when we get to this issue of cloture, is going to vote against cloture on the theory that it is not appropriate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is going to be the opportunity for Members of the Senate to vote on whether they believe a tool which will significantly improve our capacity to manage earmarks, to manage waste, is going to have a chance to be passed. It is a tool which has been offered by myself but which was actually offered by Senator Daschle and which was actually voted for by 37 members of the Democratic Party at that time, 20 of whom are still serving in the Senate. So it does seem to me that it is not unreasonable  to ask that we take it up and pass it at this time and move it forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we get to the cloture debate, I will have more to say on the matter, but I did want to come down and express my appreciation to the Senator from Tennessee for supporting the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from New Hampshire would allow me to ask him a question or two.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of course.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire was Governor, as I was, and my sense of this amendment is that it understands human nature pretty well. Is it not the Senator's experience as Governor, and as a member of the Appropriations Committee for a long time, that sometimes items slip through, and that the idea here would be for the President to be able to just send it back to Congress and say: Don't you want to take a second look at this before you actually spend taxpayers'  money? Is that not the general idea that is expressed by this amendment?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for his question. He is absolutely right. The essence of his question is that the power is retained with the legislative branch. This is not a line-item veto. This is not a veto. This is just the President saying to us, the legislators who have the power of the purse, take another look at this, which is why Senator Byrd supported it the last time it was on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the President sends a package of proposals back and asks: Do you really want to spend this money, and if a majority of the Senate decides that it did, and a majority of the House decides that it didn't, what happens then?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, answering the Senator through the Chair, then the money gets spent. If either House does not agree with the rescission, then the rescission fails. So the power of the legislative branch is retained, which is its constitutional authority, to spend money as it deems appropriate, and the President has no capacity to override that under this bill. All he has is the capacity to say to the legislative branch: Do you think you want to do this? If either House says, yes, we do, then  the money is spent.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>One final question, Mr. President. Does the Senator from New Hampshire believe that Federal spending is one of the most difficult challenges we have here and is a matter that will need a bipartisan approach? And that we need to employ all the reasonable tools that we can to try to bring Federal spending under control? Otherwise, we are going to create a massive crisis for our children and our grandchildren, and this proposal would be one such reasonable tool.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his question, which may have been rhetorical, and certainly I agree with that. To put this in context, we have to remember we are going to spend close to $3 trillion--we probably will spend $3 trillion this year in the appropriating accounts and in our budgets. There is no way we can manage all that efficiently, but certainly every tool that we can get that helps us manage it efficiently we should have. This is just another tool in the tool box  to make sure we don't waste the taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
