  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Vice President Cheney, in his usual arrogant way, refused to disclose the deliberations of his secret energy task force that gave billions to big oil and increased our dependence on OPEC. He claimed executive privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then his office illegally disclosed the identity of a secret undercover CIA officer, Valerie Plame. They claimed executive privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we find that the Vice President is mishandling classified information in volumes in violation of Executive Branch regulations. And we have the astonishing assertion that the Vice President is not part of the executive branch. Rip up those civics text books kids. Dick Cheney is above the law and the Constitution of the United States, according to his attorney. Or perhaps he's just that higher power that George Bush refers to every time he has to make a difficult decision like launching  an unneeded war in Iraq.</paragraph>
