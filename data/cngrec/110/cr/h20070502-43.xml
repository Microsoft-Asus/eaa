    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of C.W. Matthews, a long-term businessman in Cobb County, Georgia. Mr. Matthews passed away on Sunday at the age of 84, and with his passing, our Nation lost of one of its most inspired industrialists</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1940s, a 23-year-old Matthews established the C.W. Matthews Contracting Company, which today is the largest highway contractor in the southeastern United States. C.W. was a natural businessman, making friends with ease, growing his company the old-fashioned way, through hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 60 years, the company has employed thousands of workers, built many of the roads that help Cobb County thrive, and even worked on the expansion at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. In fact, Mr. Matthews, with only an eighth-grade education, created one of the most successful family-run businesses in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell Mr. Matthews' wife, Myrtle, of 66 years, his two sons, two grandsons, and seven great-grandchildren, the entire Cobb County community shares in your loss. We will always remember C.W. as a man of passion, drive and ingenuity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of C.W. Matthews.</paragraph>
