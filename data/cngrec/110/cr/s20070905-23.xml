  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Reed is in the Chamber or at least in the building. He and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison have been wanting to move this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I indicated, and the distinguished Republican leader agreed with me this morning, we need to move this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there are no amendments that are going to be offered, we should move to third reading. If there are amendments that are going to be offered, I would hope someone would notify the cloakroom immediately, Democratic or Republican cloakroom, and we will certainly be as considerate to them as necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But unless something happens pretty soon, I think we should move to third reading. If there are amendments, the two managers of the bill are happy to deal with those amendments. We are going to finish this bill tonight. I would hope on this bill I do not have to file cloture, on Military Construction and Veterans. I do not think that would be appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if there are no amendments and simply people let us return to final passage of this, I have no alternative. It would send a terribly bad message. Both the distinguished Republican leader and I think we should move forward. I hope we can. We are going to finish the bill tonight or I will file cloture on it tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>, an act making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say at the outset, the leadership of this committee has done a tremendous job in bringing forward legislation that hopefully will receive the strong bipartisan support of this body. I am especially thankful for the great work of Senator Jack Reed and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Tim Johnson and his staff for having moved forward in developing a package that, at the end of the day here, will hopefully receive the support of most of the Members of this  Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is important for us as we move forward to try to make sure we are doing everything we can for a strong America. This is important for us, for our military, for our men and women in uniform, and for our veterans. It is essential legislation which we must pass and which we all hope the President will sign into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to military construction, the bill provides $8.9 billion-plus for our Active-Duty construction efforts and $929 million for the National Guard and Reserve construction. This includes key projects around the country for the Army National Guard. This is a significant improvement over what the President requested for the National Guard. It will be part of making sure we have a strong military for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the legislation fully funds the 2005 recommendations of the BRAC, the Base Realignment and Closure Account. That BRAC recommendation which was approved by this Senate and by the Congress now 2 years ago is an important document that charts the way forward for the American military. This legislation will fully fund the recommendations of that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, with respect to Veterans Affairs, I am proud that this legislation will provide $87.5 billion for the VA. That is an increase of almost $3.6 billion over what the President requested. That increase will go to veterans health care and make sure our PTSD and mental health issues and TBI issues that we are seeing in great numbers as we are involved in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan--that we are providing the right kind of care to our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am appreciative of the national issues that are embraced in this legislation that will allow the funding to move forward and to make those projects a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to comment on a few provisions in this legislation that are important to my State of Colorado. I must say, as we worked on these matters over the years, it has been my honor to work closely with Senator Allard as we worked on important projects for our veterans and for our military in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to mention the Fitzsimons VA Hospital. There is $61 million in this legislation for Fitzsimons. Today in Colorado, the VA hospital in Denver is in very rough, shoddy condition. Our veterans deserve better. Over the last decade, there has been an effort in Colorado to try to establish a VA hospital that can become one of the crown jewels of our national health care. We are fortunate today that, under the leadership of MAJ Andy Lobb and others, we have found a site at what is the old Fitzsimons  Army hospital which has been turned over to the city of Aurora and to an authority that is rehabilitating that site. At that site today, we have already located the health facilities and hospitals for the University of Colorado. We are about ready to open a brand-new children's hospital at this center. The VA hospital is the next</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, Fort Carson. Fort Carson is a very important military installation in my State and helps us protect our Nation. Many of the men and women who serve and have trained at Fort Carson are now serving in Iraq and in Afghanistan. There is $470 million in military construction funds for Fort Carson. That amount of money will accommodate the arrival of an additional 12,000 Active-Duty and 18,360 Active-Duty family members who are currently moving to Fort Carson. I am very proud of the inclusion  of that amount of money in this legislation because it will allow us to warmly welcome the soldiers who are coming to Fort Carson, as well as their families, with the kinds of facilities they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schriever Air Force Base is part of our national defense. As I say, Colorado is blessed to be the crown jewel of the Nation's homeland defense and national security. We do that through many of our military installations, including Schriever Air Force Base. It is part of the air and space integration program. It is the place where we have our Air Force Space Command. It will receive $24.5 million for construction of the facilities that are needed there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Air Force Academy, located since the 1950s in El Paso County in Colorado Springs, is one of our Nation's premier institutes in training the future military leaders of our country. It is an installation of which I am very proud. This legislation includes $15 million for upgrades to the academic facilities at the U.S. Air Force Academy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard and Reserves station at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, CO, is an important part of the Army installations in our State. This legislation will add $7.3 million to replace the outdated squadron operations facility that houses the F-16s of the 140th Air Wing of the Colorado National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important legislation, and I am proud to be a supporter of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also will be speaking at a later time this afternoon or this evening on several other amendments I want to bring forth which are important amendments to the future of the State of Colorado but also very important to the future of our Nation's military and assuring that our military has the appropriate training facilities. We will be speaking to an amendment I will be calling up in short order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like of offer, but since I do not see a manager here, I will explain the amendment first and then ask that the amendment be brought up as soon as I finish my comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I will offer will strike an earmark from this bill that takes $4 billion intended for America's veterans and transfers it to the well-to-do citizens of Beverly Hills, CA. It is remarkable that we are even considering a veterans bill that contains an earmark for a facility on Wilshire Boulevard--the main street through Beverly Hills--a site barely 3 miles from the ritzy shops of Rodeo Drive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This earmark prevents the Veterans' Administration from taking highly valuable land in one of America's most lucrative real estate markets and putting it to work for our veterans. It would require that 200-plus acres in the middle of Beverly Hills that could be better used to generate revenue to care for America's veterans to sit empty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The earmark completely undermines the results of over 3 years of study performed by nonpartisan, independent experts. It also undermines the authority of the Veterans' Administration to best help veterans around the country, not just those in the Beverly Hills area. The language on page 44 of the Senate substitute prohibits the Veterans' Administration from taking any action to:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>exchange, trade, auction, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or reduce the acreage of, Federal land and improvements at the Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles Medical Center, California, encompassing approximately 388 acres on the north and south sides of Wilshire Boulevard and west of the 405 Freeway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Veterans' Administration estimates that reuse of this land would result in approximately $4 billion in savings--that is $450 per square foot for 205 acres--that would go directly to the Veterans' Administration for future construction since the receipts are deposited into Veterans' Administration accounts under its enhanced-use lease authority. We should note that the Veterans' Administration's enhanced-use lease authority specifically allows the Veterans' Administration to lease land and  retain receipts from the lease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Veterans' Administration can place an option to buy in the lease, whereby the property can be sold shortly after commencement of the lease, allowing the Veterans' Administration to retain the sale proceeds. This process was used in 2005 to sell property in downtown Chicago and the Veterans' Administration realized $50 million in proceeds. All can be used to better the health care of veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As important, this prohibition that is written into this earmark would result in voiding the Capital Assessment Realignment for Enhanced Services process, known as CARES, which has been agreed to by Congress and the administration. Much like BRAC, one exception could undermine the entire process that was based on veterans' needs and not on earmarked interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CARES is a systemwide process to put the Veterans' Administration's infrastructure to the best use for the current and future health care needs of veterans. This process was completed in May of 2004, and approved on a bipartisan basis by Congress and the administration. All medical construction budget requests since the completion of the study have complied with CARES recommendations and passed by Congress; that is, until today, if this bill passes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The study identified 18 sites which called for downsizing or disposal but which were naturally very controversial. Consequently, it was decided each of these sites needed "further study and analysis." Some of these studies have been completed, and realignment has begun, but the West Los Angeles study is still in process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House recently weighed in against this earmark, saying in its Statement of Administration Policy:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration strongly opposes the earmark provision that prohibits the disposal or transfer of property at the 388-acre West Los Angeles Medical Center. This language circumvents the recommendations in VA's nationwide infrastructure study, the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES). The original decision on this property would have allowed VA to designate a portion of the campus for disposal or leasing ..... it is likely that the restrictive Senate language would eliminate  more than $4 billion of revenue, which would be used to improve facilities around the country for our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The central concerns of those opposed to the reuse of portions of the 388-acre facility seems to be that it will  result in large commercial development. However, in the statement of work for the West L.A. project, the Veterans' Administration has included the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of a commitment made by a previous Secretary of Veterans Affairs, certain reuses of the property for commercial purposes were not considered in this study. In this context, the term "commercial" [includes] ..... uses such as shopping malls, movie theaters, convenience stores, fast food outlets, industrial/manufacturing activities, and other like operations. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Veterans' Administration is listening to the community and is considering their concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August of 2005, the Veterans' Administration issued an interim report, describing several options available for reuse of the land, but a final decision is still pending, and there is not yet a timetable as to when a decision will be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two public hearings--in May and September of 2005--have taken place, and one is taking place tomorrow night at the VA Center in West L.A. We should let the process we put in place run its course and not overrule the recommendations of independent experts and the Department of Veterans Affairs who are looking out for the needs of America's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If every Member of this body were to begin blocking modernization of the VA system every time a well-connected constituent in their State complains, America's veterans would be saddled with outdated infrastructure and their health care needs would not be met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to put this earmark in perspective because it would be the most wasteful and questionable earmark we have seen since the infamous "bridge to nowhere." The "bridge to nowhere" was extremely troubling, but at its heart was only an egregious waste of taxpayer dollars. This earmark, sadly, is much worse. It takes money--$4 billion of money--which would be used to care for the brave men and women who fought for our country and turns it over to build a park for Beverly Hills.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="11103">S11103</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Los Angeles Times editorialized on this situation recently, citing "the compelling demands for park space" in Beverly Hills as the best use of $4 billion. I disagree with the L.A. Times, as I often do, that $4 billion that belongs to veterans should stay with the Veterans' Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me repeat, according to the judgment of the L.A. Times, the best use of $4 billion is a public park between Beverly Hills and Sunset Beach. This defies common sense, and we should all disagree with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple. It would strike this language from the bill and preserve the VA's ability to make changes at this property that could generate over $4 billion for our Nation's veterans, as well as create a better facility that better serves the health care needs of our veterans. It would also preserve the integrity of the VA's process for realigning its infrastructure to meet the current and future health care needs of veterans and ensure that decisions are made according to the  needs of our veterans, instead of the local desires of America's most rich and famous citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to move that we set aside the pending amendment and that my amendment be sent to the desk and called up.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I come to the floor to oppose the amendment just presented by Senator DeMint. I worked very hard to get a provision in the military construction bill regarding this major piece of veterans property in the center of Los Angeles. I want to begin by thanking Senator Reed and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for agreeing to put this legislation in the Military Construction bill. This is 388 acres--388 acres--in the middle of Los Angeles. It  is bisected by Wilshire Boulevard. It is near Santa Monica Boulevard. It is a large piece of property, and on that property is a 1,000-bed veterans hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The property was deeded in 1888 following the Civil War by two families to the Federal Government to be used specifically and permanently as an Old Soldiers' Home for the use of veterans. As many Members know, California has the largest number of veterans in America--over 2 million--and over 300,000 veterans are enrolled to use the facilities in this State of which this facility is prime. At the time, as the population of disabled and elderly veterans grew following the end of the Civil War,  the Government decided to respond by establishing a number of national homes throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of 1888, Senator John P. Jones and Arcadia B. de Baker donated their Santa Monica ranch lands in southern California to establish the Pacific branch of the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The deed reads very specifically:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That whereas by an act of Congress approved March 2, 1887 to provide for the location and erection of a branch home for the disabled volunteer soldiers west of the Rocky Mountains, the Board of Managers of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were authorized, empowered, and directed to locate, establish, construct, and permanently maintain a branch of said National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sole purpose outlined in the original deed was affirmed in 2002 by then Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi when he visited the site and again when he issued a May 2004 decision regarding plans for the modernization of VA facilities elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has happened is the administration sees this land dedicated to veterans and says: Aha, there is a higher and better use for this land. We can make $4 billion if we lease out the unbuilt-upon parts of this land. That is what they have done under the radar screen. They have leased out to an automobile rental agency. They have leased out to a Fox movie lot. This is veterans land. This is land that was deeded to veterans to be used by veterans, not to be used by Fox movies, not to be used by  automobile rentals. The administration admits if they do this, they can raise $4 billion in commercial rentals from this land, thereby taking this hospital, now in its park-like setting, and encrusting it with high rise buildings along Wilshire Boulevard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, let me tell my colleagues what has happened. The veterans community has risen up in Los Angeles and said: We are the largest veterans community anywhere in the Nation. You are taking land deeded to us. You are going to lease it, rent it in any way you can for this higher and best use, which is high-rise construction, and they don't like it. The neighbors don't like it. The city doesn't like it. The Board of Supervisors doesn't like it. Yesterday, the L.A. Times editorialized against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this amendment is not an amendment just concocted out of my brain. This is an amendment that has been worked on for a long time, with Members of the House who represent this area and with the Military Construction Subcommittee of Appropriations. We want to preserve the integrity of the land that was originally granted for use as an Old Soldiers' Home for veterans purposes in this new modern-day era and do it in a way where we have access to the largest number of veterans anywhere in the United  States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it shocking that the Department of Veterans Affairs went ahead and leased parts of this land. The VA continues to this day film production on the property. It recently allowed Fox Studios to construct a set storage building there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, a 65,000-seat NFL football stadium was proposed for the open space on the west L.A. VA until Congress stepped in and passed a resolution to prohibit the action. Once again, I have asked Congress to step in and prohibit the commercialization of this site. It should be used for veterans purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when I was in Los Angeles in August, I met with former Mayor Dick Riordan and Eli Broad to discuss various options. No decisions were made, but they have a vision for this. The important thing is that it not be commercialized; that for the financial problems of the administration, they shouldn't commercialize this land. They shouldn't sell it to the highest bidder. They shouldn't go for the highest and best use. They shouldn't build high-rise construction. I will tell my colleagues, if it  happens, there will be an uprising from the neighbors in the area because this land is right off of the 405 freeway, and congestion and difficulties will result. I find it rather a crass gesture to take veterans land that is dedicated to veterans, that has a large hospital, 1,000 beds in it, that serves tens of thousands of enrolled veterans--no other city serves so many veterans--and go ahead and commercialize this site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what this does is stops that commercialization of the site. The California delegation is united, whether it is in the Senate or whether it is in the House. I can give my colleagues two  pages--and I will give my colleagues some of them--of people supporting this legislation: the County of Los Angeles; the City of Los Angeles; Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors; Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; Representatives Henry Waxman,  Berman, Harman, and Sherman; City Council members, every one of them; State Senator Kuehl; Assemblyman Feuer, Assemblywoman Bass, Assemblywoman Brownlee; Santa Monica mayor; Santa Monica council; AMVETS Post 2; AMVETS Post 116; American Legion Post 123; VFW Post 875; Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 446; the Bel-Air</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Department has announced is that they intend to make $4 billion by selling this land. You and I know what is going to go on this land: commercial, office, high-rises because that is what you get the money from. It would be a travesty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things we now know is that traumatic brain injury is a major injury from this war. We need to build on veterans facilities, not take their land away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would say, Senator DeMint, take back this motion. It is the wrong thing to do. Administration, I know you have a statement saying you oppose the amendment, but the city of Los Angeles, the county of Los Angeles is united.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam President, I move to table the amendment, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, it is just an interesting note that the man who gave this land, the 300-plus acres, to veterans was a United States Senator at the time, John P. Jones. He actually was a Republican from the State of Nevada, and he served 30 years in the Senate, from 1873 to 1903. So he was a 50-percent owner of this land, and it was a wonderful gift to the veterans. I think it should not be destroyed. Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I have come over to the floor, and I am a little out of breath because this amendment was somewhat of a surprise to me, although Senator Feinstein was a little worried about it possibly coming. I am sorry Senator DeMint isn't on the floor at this moment because I would like to look him in the eye and tell him that his amendment is misguided. It does damage to the veterans of this country and the faith they put in us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Feinstein eloquently stated, and just reiterated to me, the individual who gave this land for the veterans happened to be a Republican from Nevada who wanted to make a commitment to our veterans. So here we have a circumstance that is so bizarre because this amendment that Senator Feinstein wrote, which Senator DeMint is trying to pull out of the bill, and is now in the bill, is a very wise one. It is one that keeps faith with the veterans of this country  at a time when they deserve that support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some ways, I say to my colleagues, we have battled many times on this floor for California and for the environment and for women's rights and all the rest. But I remember when another administration at another time tried to sell the Presidio army base for billions of dollars, when the people were promised it would be a park and it was written in legislation that it would be a park. That administration said we could get billions of dollars. But the fact is that certain things you cannot put  a price on because, in the long run, it is the wrong thing to do. In the long run, it is wrong in this case to harm our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, here we have this land. As Senator Feinstein has explained to my colleagues, it is in the middle of Los Angeles. Land is a precious commodity in Los Angeles. We have a huge number of veterans who need services in Los Angeles--maybe the highest concentration of veterans in the country. I would have to check that out, but I would not be surprised; it is certainly one of the highest concentrations. Here we are in the middle of a war and we all know the horrors our soldiers are facing.  We know there are great unmet needs in the Veterans' Administration all over this country, and certainly in California. For example, we didn't even have a burn unit in California and this war has brought so many problems with serious burns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We finally were able to accommodate some beds in San Diego for that purpose. We finally were able to accommodate some of those who have lost their limbs because they were not able to get the services in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, I say to my friend, Senator DeMint of South Carolina, is not the time, not the place, not the moment to say to our veterans: You are not important; it is more important to have a rental car agency here or a movie studio here. This is not the time to tell that to our veterans. They are sacrificing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may have to have a women's clinic there someday. We may want to expand services for homeless veterans. Those of us who have lived through the Vietnam era know that homelessness followed our veterans. And still when you go on the streets of our cities, whether it is San Francisco, Los Angeles, or anywhere else, you will find a third to 45 percent of our veterans are from that era. They are Vietnam-era veterans who are homeless and struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may need to have job training centers for these returning veterans. Posttraumatic stress--my senior Senator made the point that we are now learning the depth of the problems we have. Is this the time to take this land away from the veterans? It is outrageous, and it is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Feinstein has absolutely done the right thing in this bill. I praise all of her colleagues on the committee. I wrote to Mr. Nicholson about this issue several months ago saying: Why are you doing this? I will ask to place that letter in the Record in a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Feinstein is right not only for our community in southern California but for the veterans throughout this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sent a letter on June 6, 2007, on this subject to the Honorable James Nicholson, Department of Veterans Affairs. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter I sent to Secretary Nicholson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>HART SENATE OFFICE BUILDING,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SECRETARY NICHOLSON: I am writing to you regarding the development of the West Los Angeles VA property and to urge you to ensure that its land and facilities are used by and for the veterans of the Los Angeles area.</narrative>
  <narrative>I believe that two important facts should serve as the overriding guidelines for the discussion about the West LA VA property.  First, as has been pointed out many times, this property is veterans' property--given to veterans, to be used by veterans--and should not in any way be viewed as excess property to be sold, leased, or used for other purposes. I oppose the use of an Enhanced Use Lease for any project at the West LA VA. It is for this reason that  I fully support Congressman Waxman's and Senator Feinstein's legislative efforts to preserve the land for veterans' use.</narrative>
  <narrative>The second important fact is that at least one million veterans reside within a 50 mile radius of the West LA VA property, more than in 42 other states combined. When we consider that this number continues to grow and that the recent additions to the veterans rolls are sometimes severely disabled, more services rather than fewer services will be needed over time. Additionally, a remarkable number of the homeless population of the area are veterans, many of whom suffer from substance abuse or  mental health problems. In Los Angeles County alone, it is estimated that at least 18,000 veterans are without shelter or a place to live. A broad range of services are desperately needed for them.</narrative>
  <narrative>As the master plan for this property is developed, many people are looking to the Department of Veterans Affairs to use this property to support veterans and their needs. The veterans of the Los Angeles area benefit greatly from the services offered there now, and it is crucial that with the increasing numbers of returning veterans it remain a facility fully committed to serving them--they deserve nothing less.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I talked about the fact that at least a million veterans reside within a 50-mile radius of the west Los Angeles VA property, more than in 42 other States combined. When we consider that this number continues to grow, this is clearly the wrong thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that what my colleague has done in this bill is in concert with everyone in our area. I don't think she or I would walk in and offer an amendment that was a direct blow to a community in South Carolina. We would never do that. That would not be the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community is opposed to what Mr. DeMint wants to have happen. Local government, many veterans, from the mayor's office, to the city council, to the board of supervisors, to the full congressional delegation, there is enormous support for the provision that Senator Feinstein has placed in this bill. Dozens of local veterans groups are in support of her provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to read some of these supporters because I want to give a sense to my colleagues that they should stick with us on this issue because Senator Feinstein's language that she got placed in this bill is strongly supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire list.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I will name a few. The County of Los Angeles, the city of Los Angeles, Representative Waxman, and every other Representative from that area; Howard Berman, Harman, Sherman, the L.A. City Council president, State Senator Sheila Kuehl, all those local folks, former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan, AMVETS Post 2, AMVETS Post 116, American Legion Post 123, VFW Post 875, Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 446, and then a slew of homeowners associations, including  the Coalition of Homeowner Associations Council District 5, the Coalition for Veterans Land, Friends of Westwood, and it goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have the religious community: St. Paul the Apostle Catholic parish. We have the chamber of commerce. We have the neighborhood council. It just goes on. The park conservancy, the civic association. The administration is wrong to take this action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Feinstein is right. She mentioned colleagues on the committee who were very helpful to her. It is very important to note that she moved in a very bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for withdrawing her motion to table to give me this opportunity to express myself because I think what she did was so important, and certainly she spoke for both of us when she did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope she will make this motion to table at the appropriate time, and we can table this amendment and send a message tonight to the veterans across this country that we stand with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Rhode Island.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300081" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I join Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer in their efforts to preserve this property in west Los Angeles as a VA facility and not turn it over to developers. This is commensurate with the deed that originally granted this property to the United States back in 1888. The deed reads as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, by an act of Congress approved March 2, 1887, to provide for the location and erection of a branch home for the disabled volunteer soldiers west of the Rocky Mountains, the board of managers of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers are authorized, empowered, and directed to locate, establish, construct and permanently maintain a branch of said National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this donation and the purpose that has been preserved over these many years has been to provide a place where veterans can be hospitalized, and it has become part of not only the Veterans' Administration system, it has become part of the culture of the community of Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the original deed has been reaffirmed numerous times. It was reaffirmed in 2002 by then-VA Secretary Anthony Principi when he visited the site and when he issued a May 2004 decision regarding plans for the modernization of VA facilities nationwide. In fact, a document released by the VA previewing the September 6, 2005, Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services--the CARES process--of the local advisory panel meeting regarding the west L.A. VA site states the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that the VA preserve the integrity of the land originally granted for use as an old Soldier's home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is the purpose of the language included in the appropriations bill by Senator Feinstein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CARES process was akin to the BRAC process used for the military, going around and looking at the uses of all the Veterans' Administration facilities around the country and concluding what is the best and highest purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is terribly important that the conclusion of this panel, very recently, is that it is important that the VA preserve the integrity of the land originally granted for use as an Old Soldiers' Home. That is what Senator Feinstein proposes to do, and it would be undercut by the amendment of Senator DeMint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer as they are trying not only to preserve the integrity of this land but also to preserve the integrity of the community of west Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had occasion to drive by this area, and I will stand corrected by the local geographic experts, but it is a place of open space and tranquility in a very large metropolitan area. So it is a value beyond the VA system; it is a  value to the community of Los Angeles. That is why there is a huge number of supporters of this initiative by Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer: the County of Los Angeles, the city of Los Angeles, Supervisor  Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Representative Waxman, our colleagues in the House--all these individuals are standing shoulder to shoulder on this issue. This is consistent with the original donation of the land. It is consistent with the evaluation of the Veterans' Administration as to how they should use the land, and it is consistent with the community of Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud and commend the Senators from California for their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I particularly thank Chairman Reed for putting this provision in the bill. I am very grateful. I am also very grateful for his defense of it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, for her help on the floor, for her support, and for her continuous advocacy on behalf of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, would you sell the National Mall for profit? Would you sell Roosevelt Island for profit? Would you sell any part of the federal highway system for profit? Why would you take land that has been dedicated for veterans purposes and lease it out for profit when we know, as Senator Boxer said, we have thousands of homeless veterans, and right now there is a proposal moving forward to possibly build some homeless units for veterans on that facility?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This land was deeded to the Federal Government, a huge amount of land, for the purpose of veterans, not for Fox movie studios, not for Enterprise, or whatever car rental agency, but for veterans in a city with the largest number of veterans in the United States, and over 322,000 veterans enrolled to use that facility, with a hospital of 1,000 beds on that facility. You are going to begin to lease out that land?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is terrible, just terrible. The next step would be the National Mall. We ought to resist this effort. There are a lot of ways to make money, but I think the worst way is to make money off veterans at this point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much resist this amendment. I join with my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, in resisting the amendment. I join with the committee chairman in resisting this amendment. I join with the ranking member of the committee in resisting this amendment. I hope there will be a very strong vote.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Moody Opens Doors to New Housing</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Tech. Sgt. Parker Gyokeres)</narrative>
  <narrative>Moody Air Force Base, GA.--Team Moody celebrated the completion of the first new single family housing units with a ribbon cutting ceremony Jan. 31, at the new Magnolia Grove Housing area.</narrative>
  <narrative>The $52 million project provides 383 three and four-bedroom homes in Magnolia Grove, each with no less than 1,630 square feet of space.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dignitaries attending the ribbon cutting ceremony included Maj. Gen. Del Eulberg, Air Force Civil Engineer, Col. Joe Callahan, 23rd Wing commander, and leadership from American Eagle Communities LLC.</narrative>
  <narrative>"This is a big day for the Airmen and families of Team Moody," said Colonel Callahan. "The Magnolia Grove homes are the nicest base housing units I have ever seen in the 31 years I have been living in base housing. Moody Family Housing has created a community that any Airman would be proud to live in." Moody Family Housing is a 50-year, joint public-private partnership between American Eagle Communities and the U.S. Air Force.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The partnership is intended to improve standards of living for current and future base housing residents," said Louis Screws, 23rd Civil Engineer Squadron housing flight chief.</narrative>
  <narrative>The homes are fully owned and maintained by American Eagle under rules agreed to in the project's transaction documents.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The Air Force benefits because they receive quality new housing without the up-front money a military construction contract requires," said Mr. Screws. "American Eagle can use private sector financing and private resources to build these homes faster, better and more economically using local codes and standards."</narrative>
  <narrative>The units are built with an all-metal framing system that arrives partially assembled in a kit for a single home. It takes only four days for a team of eight workers to frame an entire house, said Rich Safranic, Moody Family Housing quality assurance director.</narrative>
  <narrative>By using all-metal construction, the materials are less expensive to transport, stronger than wood, will not burn and can be recycled easily, said Mr. Safranic.</narrative>
  <narrative>American Eagle plans to use this construction technique for every home in Magnolia Grove, and with an average of five homes a week arriving at the site, every time-saving measure is essential, added the quality assurance inspector.</narrative>
  <narrative>Moody Family Housing expects to hand over an average of one house a day to Air Force inspectors for certification, said Naomi Hendricks, Moody Family Housing project director. The construction on Magnolia Grove housing is scheduled to be completed this December.</narrative>
  <narrative>The first residents of Magnolia Grove will be the 94 families currently residing in the "Courts" townhouses of the Quiet Pines housing area.These units are scheduled to be demolished as the residents are relocated. MFH will then use the land for new senior leadership housing, said Mr. Screws.</narrative>
  <narrative>American Eagle purchased 700 acres of peanut farmland along the southern edge of Moody. There will be 383 single-family units built on 150 acres of this property. The American Eagle Communities has permanently donated approximately 200 acres to the Banks Lake Wildlife Refuge Area. The remaining 350 acres are being set aside for future base-housing growth.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We are the first major installation to accomplish the goal of creating a new community using a privatized partnership like this," said Lowell Klepper, 23rd CES deputy base civil engineer. "Moody has been working towards this point for more than 20 years."</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>I note for the record that after 4 years of work on a housing privatization contract and the millions spent, exactly two houses have been built. This article talks about a celebration at Moody Air Force base upon the completion of these two homes. The problem is, neither one of these two houses has ever been occupied, and the privatization issue at Moody has developed into a real mess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Air Force entered into a real estate transaction with Carabetta Enterprises Inc. for privatized housing at Moody Air Force Base. The estimated cost of the project has exceeded available funding by $25 million, and the project lender stopped funding in March of 2007 to prevent all funds from being expended. At least three other Air Force bases--Patrick Air Force base in Florida, Little Rock Air Force base in Arkansas, and Hanscom Air Force base in Massachusetts--have similar contracting delays  with privatized housing projects associated with this same contractor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite having declared bankruptcy in the 1990s and supposedly being embroiled in a series of previous lawsuits over Government contracts, the Carabetta organization was allowed to form a new joint entity, American Eagle Communities LLC, and has won Government contracts in five States for a total $3.3 billion. American Eagle won the $50 million contract for the Moody Air Force Base Magnolia Grove privatized housing project, hired one of its principals to be the general contractor, and now has  left dozens of local subcontractors unpaid for months, resulting in numerous liens being filed, a complete lockdown of the site, and millions of dollars in unpaid bills to local subcontractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been concern that we have 1,000 new personnel who are going to be coming into Moody by 2009 under the BRAC, and this housing project is specifically designed to accommodate the influx. I have written two letters to the Air Force expressing my concern and inquiring about the delay and the intended plan of action. In response, the Air Force has said that because it has no legal agreements with the contractor, issues of nonpayment between the contractor and subcontractors must be resolved  through the legal system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not an acceptable answer. The Air Force is a contractor. This directly affects the quality of life of Air Force personnel at Moody Air Force Base as well as the other bases that have contracts with this particular contractor. Air Force personnel are suffering because of the poor performance of this contractor, and the Air Force should have been more proactive to fix this problem before we got to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have several questions on this issue that have yet to be answered. I am specifically asking the Air Force to answer: First, what were the factors contributing to the decision to award Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. this contract, given their known previous defaults and bankruptcy declarations? Secondly, is the Air Force currently taking steps to terminate this contract and, if so, what steps are they taking and, if not, why not? Thirdly, what is the plan for housing the incoming Air Force personnel  slated to live in the new quarters at Moody Air Force base as well as the other bases that are affected by the default of this contractor?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my opinion, this issue is also ripe for an IG investigation to figure out exactly what went wrong, why this contractor was awarded a $3.3 billion contract for privatized housing, covering five States, work on all of which has been halted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Air Force's expeditious attention and resolution of this issue.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill also strengthens our military bases, providing money for military construction efforts and improvements at bases, and to support projects related to the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 2005, known as BRAC. While I support strengthening our bases and their overall infrastructure, some disturbing information has come to light about the BRAC process and the closing of the Fort Monmouth Army base in New Jersey since our Appropriations Committee  completed work on this bill that warrants our immediate attention.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, fighting wars involves not just the men and women on the ground overseas but also dedicated workers here at home. It depends on the training and research done at military bases like Fort Monmouth. Fort Monmouth provides intelligence and reconnaissance support for our Armed Forces, making them more effective fighters and protecting their lives.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>Fort Monmouth researchers also develop critical technology for our Armed Forces, such as "Warlock Jammers," which were engineered at Fort Monmouth and modified for use in Iraq. This equipment emits radio frequencies that interfere with the signals that set off improvised explosive devices known as IEDs. The military was able to deploy them within 60 days of their development, and they started saving American lives.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300081" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I agree that great work has been done at Fort Monmouth to support our military and it deserves recognition. Fort Monmouth has played an important role in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the men and women working there are to be commended.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>The BRAC Commission knew about that important work and wanted to make sure our troops in the field would not be harmed by closing the base. They included a requirement that the Secretary of Defense issue a report to Congress proving that "movement of organizations, functions, or activities from Fort Monmouth to Aberdeen Proving Ground will be accomplished without disruption of their support to the Global War on Terrorism."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>Yet more than 2 years after the BRAC Commission vote, the administration has failed to produce this report. To make matters worse, the Army is trying to move personnel out of Fort Monmouth now, before it has even considered the effect on our Armed Forces. Before the Army starts to shift work out of Fort Monmouth, we need to know that it won't hurt our troops.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>When we raised concerns about this to the Army, it halted the transfer and our understanding was that the Army would wait until the report required by BRAC was completed. But now the Army has reversed course and plans to start transferring people soon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>This is simply unacceptable. No personnel should be transferred out of Fort Monmouth until the Department of Defense has submitted the report to Congress proving that the closure of Fort Monmouth will not hurt troops in the field.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300081" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for his thoughts. It is my understanding that the Army plans to issue a report on Fort Monmouth by the end of the year. I can also assure my colleagues from New Jersey that the Senate Armed Services Committee as the authorizing committee will continue its oversight of the BRAC process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record, the Budget Committee's official scoring of <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>,  the Military Construction and Department of Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, provides $64.745 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2008, which will result in new outlays of $38.327 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the bill will total $55.001 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate-reported bill is at its section 302(b) allocation for budget authority and $20 million below its allocation for outlays. No points of order lie against the committee-reported bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the distinguished chairman of the Military Construction and Department of Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing this legislation before the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="FORT MONMOUTH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I express my strong support for the level of funding provided for the Department of Veterans Affairs in the pending Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. I also take this opportunity to congratulate Senators Reed, Byrd, and the other members of the committee for their hard work on this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill truly reflects our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care and benefits. Indeed, the bill before us closely tracks the level of funding recommended by the Veterans' Affairs Committee in our Views and Estimates to the Budget Committee. This legislation would provide a $6.5 billion increase for VA health care over last year, $3.6 billion more than the President requested. This represents the largest increase in funding ever for VA health care. I am very pleased that there are additional  funds included in this amount for the treatment of traumatic brain injuries, TBI, and for VA mental health programs, to treat the "invisible wounds" that many veterans suffer from after serving in combat. These are two areas of vital importance to servicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the Military Construction-VA Appropriations Subcommittee members for their support of the VA Office of Inspector General. The $16 million increase for the OIG will enable that office to continue conducting extremely valuable oversight of VA. The VA inspector general has consistently been vitally important to the Veterans' Affairs Committee in the execution of our oversight responsibilities. The OIG is the central gear in VA's internal controls and quality assurance mechanism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of Priority 8--so-called middle-income--veterans and their current exclusion from the VA health care system. The majority members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, in our Views and Estimates, endorsed re-opening enrollment to these veterans. That recommendation was followed. The omnibus health care authorization bill recently reported out by the Veterans' Affairs Committee contains a provision that would allow these veterans back into  VA. We would fully allow the VA Secretary to close enrollment off at any time. It is my view that adequate funding to re-open enrollment exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to also express my strong support for the $21.5 billion in funding for military construction projects included in this bill. This bill fully funds the administration's request for BRAC and the President's Grow the Force Initiative. It also includes the much needed funding necessary to repair and maintain the military facilities that are so critically important to the readiness and well-being of the Armed Forces. I am particularly in support of the bill's inclusion of $929 million for National  Guard and Reserve construction. We have asked our National Guard and Reserve troops to commit significant sacrifices for this Nation and we should be prepared to provide these brave men and women the support they need to fulfill their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Reed and the other subcommittee members for their work on this bill and for sending the right message to both our Nation's veterans and those currently serving. We have made a commitment to providing support both before and after active service, and this measure honors that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the legislation before us today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a critical issue regarding Iraq and Afghanistan veterans' health care needs. America's Armed Forces are sustaining attacks by rocket-propelled grenades, improvised explosive devices, and land mines almost daily in Iraq and Afghanistan. These injured soldiers require specialized care from providers experienced in treating their unique health challenges. These blast injuries result from the complex pressure waves generated by an  explosion. Air-filled organs such as the ear, lung, and other organs surrounded by fluid-filled cavities such as the brain and spinal cord are especially susceptible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I visited with a soldier named Mack Richards who sustained blast wounds to his wrist and ankle in Iraq, as well as traumatic brain injury, or TBI. This soldier recounted to me his difficulty and frustration in receiving treatment for his brain injury. He was left at an army base far from home for months before he was sent back to his family and finally received therapy from our local rehabilitation facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has been assured that veterans with brain and other complex injuries are able to access the specialized treatment they need. However, Mack's story is not unique, and I think the time has come to question what role the underutilized capacity in civilian rehab can play. That is not to devalue VA efforts and the great facilities the VA has to offer, but to ask how civilian providers can complement VA facilities and improve the care afforded our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The large numbers of traumatic brain injury survivors returning home from war highlights the need to leverage all of the resources available to us for the successful treatment and rehabilitation of our injured troops. Tapping into existing civilian TBI research and treatment capacity can help improve outcomes and supplement the care systems being developed at both the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue which I know can stir up sensitivities given the diversity of our veteran population. I want to make it clear that I am fully committed, as are many of my colleagues, to ensuring the VA has the resources and strength to offer sustainable and top quality care for every American veteran. That said, the public and civilian sectors must come together to meet the needs of our newest generation of wounded warriors. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the Department of Defense and  the Department of Veterans Affairs have contracted with civilian clinicians and providers to make up the TBI continuum of care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VA has shown tremendous effort in addressing the needs of our returning troops, given the enormous challenges we face. However, I believe the large volume of returning veterans with increasingly complex health care needs require an increasingly dynamic approach to better serve those who have given so much for our country. The need for timely treatment and immediate rehabilitation expertise and capacity requires additional resources and flexibility for the VA to form partnerships to ensure  top notch care for  our service personnel. And, if this care can be provided closer to veterans' community and family support networks, then it is a win-win as families can be kept together and servicemembers can more easily transition back into their daily routines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have included language in this bill requesting the Department of Veterans Affairs to report to Congress on the conditions and criteria used for contracting with civilian rehabilitation providers, and outreach efforts being conducted to inform veterans and those who advocate on their behalf about such treatment options. I look forward to working with the VA and my colleagues to make sure our veterans have access to the care their sacrifices and personal injuries require.</paragraph>
