    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the city of Erlanger, KY, which is the recipient of the 2006 Award for Municipal Excellence at the National League of Cities' Congress of Cities. This city's Tiered Advanced Life Support System Program for Emergency Medical Services earned Erlanger the Gold Award, which is presented to cities that have a population below 50,000 people. By winning this prestigious award, the Erlanger Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services, EMS,  team exhibit the power of hard work as well as their dedication to their community while serving as an example to the rest of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1989, the goal of the Awards for Municipal Excellence has been to recognize cities that improve the lives of citizens in their communities. These awards identify and feature outstanding city and town programs that show innovation in enhancing the quality of life in America's communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fire department and city of Erlanger recognize the need to have paramedic response and transport capabilities for the safety and welfare of the citizens in its community of 17,000 people. After debating several options, they found a fire service-based EMS delivery model that was affordable and could be enacted immediately. This model provides two cross-trained EMS firefighters on a transport rescue unit, followed by a cross-trained firefighter paramedic in a staff car who can assist and ride  in the rescue ambulance with the patient. If the patient does not need advanced life support, the paramedic is ready to respond immediately to the next emergency call. This model delivers the best medical care available and keeps more firefighters on the street to deliver the highest quality fire protection. This joint partnership has made a positive difference in both fire and EMS delivery services in the community of Erlanger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the city of Erlanger, KY, for receiving this Award for Municipal Excellence. By using an innovative approach to address an important community need, they have created this outstanding program. This cutting-edge approach to community emergency response shines as a model for all communities in Kentucky and the United States. This is a true example of Kentucky at its finest and a leadership example to the entire Commonwealth.</paragraph>
