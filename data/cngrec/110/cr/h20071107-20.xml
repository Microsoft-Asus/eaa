    <paragraph>Bipartisanship. You hear this expression tossed around quite frequently in political circles, so much so that perhaps it has almost become a cliche.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, we don't see genuine examples of bipartisan cooperation in this Chamber enough, and this no doubt disappoints the American people. Over 140 days ago, Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass one of the largest necessary spending increases in the 77-year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. To ensure the health and well-being of our veterans, this bill is a needed investment veterans care about and the care they need to receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eight weeks ago, a similar version passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis. Instead of allowing the House and Senate to iron out minor differences yesterday, the House leadership insisted that veterans funding be held hostage for a wasteful, pork-barrel spending bill that would increase the deficit by $10 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No doubt this shameful game further disappointed the already jaded public perception of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's get back to bipartisanship and swiftly pass this important legislation in its original form. Then together, on behalf of our veterans, we can all celebrate when it becomes law.</paragraph>
