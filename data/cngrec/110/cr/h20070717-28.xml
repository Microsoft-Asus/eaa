  <speaking speaker="400645" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express the importance of access to colorectal cancer screening tests for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like far too many other Americans, my life has been touched by cancer. Nine years ago I lost my mother, Janna, to colon cancer. I understand too well the importance of catching cancer early.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colorectal cancer is a leading killer in the United States that will unnecessarily take the lives of more than 52,000 of our constituents. This is a tragedy because we have every tool necessary to prevent suffering and almost all death from this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last September I took very seriously the fact that I signed the 2015 Pledge to  do anything possible to eliminate suffering and death due to cancer by the year 2015. Today I take a step in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-two States and the District of Columbia have protections in place to provide access to screening and early detection for colorectal cancer. It is time that the rest of the country has the same access that could save their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join me and my friend from Texas, Mr. Ralph Hall, as we introduce the Colorectal Cancer Screening and Detection Coverage Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
