    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize a significant milestone for one of the towns in my home State of Connecticut. This year, the town of Ridgefield is celebrating the 300th anniversary of its founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ridgefield's heritage dates back to the founding of this country and the American Revolution. A small militia force led by Generals David Wooster and Benedict Arnold faced off here against a larger British force at the Battle of Ridgefield on April 27, 1777. Whether it's the graves of the soldiers  on both sides of the conflict who were killed and are now buried together in a cemetery on Main Street, or the cannon ball that remains lodged into the side  of the Keeler Tavern, landmarks of this battle can still be found throughout Ridgefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This beautiful colonial town of approximately 24,000 people has historically been known as a farming community. Today it is regularly recognized not only for the high quality of its schools and tranquility but for its world class restaurants and inns. Considered right after World War II as a potential location for the United Nations secretariat building, Ridgefield has managed to retain its small town, New England charm to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents of Ridgefield are rightfully proud of the town's rich cultural and agricultural heritage and have organized a number of activities to celebrate this momentous occasion. I ask my colleagues to join with me in congratulating my many friends among the good people of Ridgefield as they gather this year to celebrate their town's three centuries of history.</paragraph>
