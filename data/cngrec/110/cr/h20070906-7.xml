    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today it is my honor to welcome Major Jonathan Etterbeek to the House of Representatives to deliver the House invocation. He is a native of Holland, Michigan, and he is a chaplain of the U.S. Army's 32nd Medical Brigade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House is honored to have you with us today. We appreciate you being here to deliver this invocation. It is a time-honored tradition in this historic Chamber to request God's guidance as Congress conducts the business of the American people. We thank you for doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Etterbeek is a graduate of Holland High School, Hope College, and Western Theological Seminary, and he is currently stationed in Fort Sam Houston, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While he has many accomplishments and a distinguished record in the military, it was especially important in 2005 where I had the opportunity in front of a hometown audience to present him with the medals that he earned for his distinguished service while he was in Iraq. I was honored to award him the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Iraq Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Combat Action Badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Etterbeek, thank you for being here today. Thank you for your service to this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
