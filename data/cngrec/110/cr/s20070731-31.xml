    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the 114th Fighter Wing of the South Dakota Air National Guard for being awarded the 2007 Outstanding Air National Guard Flying Unit Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1956, the 114th Fighter Wing has been an outstanding unit and has played an important role in the South Dakota National Guard. The unit has a proud history of accomplishment and this award is in keeping with that tradition. Over the years, the 114th has received numerous unit citations such as the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Streamer for combat duty as a part of Operation Just Cause in Panama. The 114th Fighter Wing has trained with the Navy, Marines,  and the Air Force during Operation Provide Comfort II in Turkey, Commando Sling in Singapore, Operation Southern Watch in Al Jaber, Kuwait, and numerous others. Today, the unit is continuing to uphold its  standard of excellence by providing significant contributions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the War on Terror. Their courageous efforts in protecting America should make both South Dakota and the Nation proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to represent the men and women who make up the 114th Fighter Wing and congratulate them on their award.</paragraph>
