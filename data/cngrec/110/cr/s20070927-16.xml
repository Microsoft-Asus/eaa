  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, although we are in morning business, I wish to add some comments to what Senator Mikulski said about privatization because what we have seen throughout our Government--whether it is Medicare, the efforts to privatize, which, unfortunately, have been partially successful at privatizing but not so successful in serving the public, serving seniors, and the totally unsuccessful effort to privatize Social Security--what we have seen in public education, what we have  seen in the prison system in my State of Ohio, what we seen in several kinds of efforts to privatize have often resulted in more taxpayer dollars being spent, a reduction in service, to be sure, less efficiency, and less accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So her amendment is right on the mark. Her efforts in privatization generally are very important. I thank the senior Senator from Maryland on that.</paragraph>
