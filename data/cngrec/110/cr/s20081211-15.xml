  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a true patriot and a dear friend, Senator John Warner of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been an extraordinary experience for me to serve with Senator Warner on the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the capacity of his service on the Armed Services Committee, which has been upwards of three decades, serving as its chairman, the insight and guidance he has provided has been invaluable. Over and over, you will hear the  members of that committee speak as I, as if with one voice, how we appreciate his public service. He has great knowledge. He has great wisdom. It is tempered with a wonderful personality that is most studious and deliberative. Few  have done as much to champion the cause of our men and women in the Armed Forces of the United States as John Warner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senator admires him for his sense of fairness, for his mutual respect of all the Members of the Senate. We know there has to be civility in the Senate for it to function. There has to be mutual respect. There has to be respect for the truth. There has to be respect for the dignity of individuals and those Senators' families. All of that is certainly apropos of the senior Senator from Virginia. Over and over, I have been in situations with him that could have been adversarial. Yet his calm  judgment and reason have brought people together. Of course, that is the admonition of the Good Book: "Come let us reason together."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over and over, as I have sought his counsel on matters of some of the Nation's highest secrets, John Warner has provided the leadership and the clarity, as we have made those decisions, sometimes making those decisions together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is with a great reluctance on my part that I see our colleague, Senator Warner, retire after a very distinguished and long career. It has been a privilege to serve with John. I will miss him as a colleague. I will miss his leadership, his fairness, and his great capacity as a gentleman of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
