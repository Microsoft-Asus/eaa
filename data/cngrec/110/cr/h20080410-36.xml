    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of the Morris Black and Sons, a renowned interior design business located within my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1908 by company namesake Morris Black, the business began as a horse and wagon team supplying contractors with construction needs including pipe, bricks, sand, cement and other masonry products. The company quickly grew as the Lehigh Valley became an industrial center, and by 1928, operated warehouses in Allentown and Bethlehem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1930s, Morris was joined by his sons, Benjamin and Samuel in running the family business. Under this leadership, Morris Black continued to develop, and in 1943, became one of the first companies in the Nation to incorporate an insulation subcontracting business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A third generation of the Black family became associated with the company in the 1970s when Morris Black and Sons entered a period of rapid change. In the mid 1970s the company saw a growing interest in do-it-yourself remodeling and design. With the do-it-yourself trend on the horizon, Morris Black and Sons opened one of the first home design centers that marketed building products directly to active homeowners in 1976.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over time, the company has continued to expand, opening its first satellite location in 1999 and the second in 2000, and has developed a strong reputation for quality throughout eastern Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Saturday the family marks its 100th anniversary. I wish the entire Morris Black family and company a healthy congratulations.</paragraph>
