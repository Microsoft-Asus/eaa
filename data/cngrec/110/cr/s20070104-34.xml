    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pick up a little bit from Senator Murray's remarks and talk about <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill>, the stem cell bill, that was also introduced today by the majority leader, Senator Reid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stem cell research, when it is stripped of all of the phony arguments and rhetoric, is basically about hope. It is hope for people with Lou Gehrig's disease. It is hope for people with spinal cord injuries, hope for kids suffering from juvenile diabetes, hope for people with Parkinson's disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this Congress, we are going to bring those hopes one giant step closer to reality. At long last, hopefully, we will lift the President's restrictions on stem cell research and finally give our Nation's best scientists the tools they need to produce treatments and cures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we have introduced today, <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill>, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, is the exact same bill that passed both Houses last year with strong bipartisan support. The House passed the bill 238 to 194. The Senate passed it 63 to 37.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the President chose to exercise his first and only veto of his administration in vetoing this bill. And with his veto, the President ignored the will of the American people, he ignored scores of Nobel laureates, he ignored top scientists at the National Institutes of Health, and with one stroke of his pen, he dashed the hopes of millions of Americans suffering from diseases that could one day be cured or treated through stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now we are back, it is a new Congress, and the voices of hope are stronger than ever. In November, the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American people elected many new Members of Congress who support stem cell research and replaced many former Members of Congress who opposed this research. As a result, we will pass this bill again this year, and the margins of victory will be even wider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me spend a moment reviewing what <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> would accomplish. More than 5 years ago, the President announced in a speech that federally funded scientists could conduct research only on embryonic stem cell lines that were derived prior to 9 p.m. on August 9, 2001. The President gave his speech that evening, August 9, 2001. He said all of those stem cell lines derived before 9 p.m., that was OK, but if they were derived after 9 p.m., they could not be funded with Federal funds. I never understood  that. Why was it 9 p.m.? Why wasn't it 9:15 p.m. or maybe 8:45, 9:13? Why was it 9 p.m.? At the beginning, one has to question the logic of why 9 p.m. was the time barrier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President announced his policy, he said that 78 stem cell lines were eligible for research. We now know that is not so. Only 21 are eligible, not nearly enough to reflect the genetic diversity of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is more, every one of those lines, all 21 of those lines are contaminated with mouse cells. They were grown on mouse cells, so they are all contaminated. So none of them will ever be used for any kind of human treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, hundreds of new stem cell lines have been derived since the President's arbitrary deadline. Many of these lines are uncontaminated, they are healthy, but they are totally off limits to federally funded scientists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is really a shame because if we are serious about realizing the promise of stem cell research, our scientists need access to the best stem cell lines possible. We need a stem cell policy that offers true and meaningful hope. That is what <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> would provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, federally funded researchers could study any stem cell line, regardless of the date it was derived, as long as certain strong ethical guidelines are met. I point out, again, as I have in the past and I will continue to point out, that the ethical guidelines in <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> are stronger than the ethical guidelines under the existing policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are those guidelines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, no money can be exchanged. No one can ever be paid for donating embryos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, these embryos can only be used for stem cell research and for nothing else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And third, the donors have to give informed consent for them to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final point is most important. The only way a stem cell line could be eligible for this federally funded research is if it were derived from an embryo that was otherwise going to be discarded. Let me, again, say what that means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 400,000 embryos frozen in in vitro fertilization clinics all over the country--over 400,000. Right now, the only thing that can happen to those is that they be discarded. They are thrown away every day. Every day embryos are discarded in in vitro fertilization clinics all over America. The donors have no other choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take friends of mine, a young couple. They couldn't have children. They finally went to an IVF clinic. That  didn't work. They went to another one. Now she is pregnant, and they are going to have twins. They may have one or two more children--I don't know--but there are going to be some of those embryos left over. Right now my friend's only choice is to have them discarded. That is her only choice. But as she said to me: I would love, after I have my children  and my family, if there are embryos left over, I would love to be able to donate them for stem cell research to help cure disease and to help people who are sick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now she cannot do that. Neither she nor her husband can do that. Our bill would allow them to have that option. No one is forced to do anything, but it would allow them to have that option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also, wish to point out again one of the misconceptions. These are embryos. They are blastocysts. They have about 100 cells. I always do this: I put a dot on a piece of paper, hold it up and say: Can anybody see that? That is what we are talking about. It is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence. There is a lot of misinformation about what we are talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said before, Congress is going to pass this bill, that is certain. Sadly, some are already predicting the President will veto it for a second time. I hope they are wrong. I hope the President will respect the will of the people and sign the stem cell research bill. But if he does veto it, we will persist. We will use every legislative means at our disposal to make sure <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> is enacted into law, and it will happen during this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My nephew Kelly is one of the millions of Americans whose hopes depend on stem cell research. Kelly was in the Navy. He had a terrible accident on an aircraft carrier,  and he has been basically a paraplegic now for 28 years. But he has kept his hopes alive that our scientists will be able to find a cure. Stem cell research offers the best hope for people suffering from spinal cord injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time to give them the hope, to lift the ban on stem cell research. As I said, we will do that in this Congress. It will be one of the first bills we pass. I hope the President will sign it and we can move on. But if not, for Kelly and for so many millions of Americans, we hope the long wait is almost over. I predict that hope will prevail in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
