    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a new terrorist has just been captured in Florida. Not an international terrorist, but a homegrown domestic one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The facts are hard to comprehend, but here they are, according to the Associated Press. A husband took his wife on a canoe trip, and finding a wilderness spot, he took her ashore and then he raped her. He tied his naked wife to a tree and assaulted her with the butt of a knife. He let her hang on the tree for over 2 hours, then he took her off and raped her again. All the while, get this, he was videotaping this ghastly, dastardly crime. This crime is one of intimidation, degradation and humiliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, rape is a crime where the deviant tries to destroy the soul of the victim. When the assault occurs in the family, the domestic rape is even worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the hubby is facing a multitude of criminal charges, as it ought to be. Wives are not male property and these crimes are not to be excused as a domestic problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offender should be given quick, accurate justice, and then tell him to pack his toothbrush, because justice is a thing we are going to find and demand life behind bars in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
