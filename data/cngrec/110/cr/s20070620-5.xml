    <paragraph>Mr. President, following any remarks that I make and the Republican leader does, if he chooses to do so, we will begin consideration of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy bill, with 30 minutes of debate on the DeMint amendment No. 1546. A vote in relation to that amendment is expected to occur at 10:10 or 10:15 this morning. Last night cloture was filed on the Baucus-Grassley amendment, and cloture was filed to the substitute amendment and the Energy bill itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night I stated the obvious. Every step of the way for 6 months we have had to procedurally jump through every hoop the complicated Senate rules allow. That is unfortunate. We, as Democrats, have been in the minority, and we never did anything similar to this. There were times when it was necessary, because of what we did not allow, that cloture was filed. But this is untoward, what is happening now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the Republican leadership would look at this. Is it necessary, if we get cloture on the substitute, to have to go forward on a cloture vote on the bill itself? I hope not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Germane first-degree amendments to the substitute and the bill need to be filed at the desk by 1 p.m. today. There will be votes today and into the evening.</paragraph>
