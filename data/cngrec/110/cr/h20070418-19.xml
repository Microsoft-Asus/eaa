    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask all of us what kind of Nation are we when we neglect the needs of our senior citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 2 weeks, I have received over 15,000 cards from voters in Wisconsin, just like this one from Elaine in Peshtigo which reads: "I am soon an 80-year-old woman and a widow. My husband and I farmed, and we certainly had hard times the first years. But the years now are harder for old people. Oil companies take a huge profit. The CEOs make a salary no man on Earth is worth. The pill companies are taking huge profits with no consideration for our old people. The people of my generation  lived through the Depression, World War II and two more wars, and now, in our old age, we face other obstacles."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, there is a better way of doing things in America, and by working together, we will find it with no patient left behind.</paragraph>
