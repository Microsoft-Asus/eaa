  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize September 2007 as National Life Insurance Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I speak from personal experience when I say that you should never take for granted that you will always wake up tomorrow in the same condition you are in today. We can never be sure when our time will come, and it is always best to be prepared for the unexpected. An important part of preparedness is financial readiness, and that is why National Life Insurance Awareness Month is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 68 million Americans either with no life insurance or who are underinsured. It is concerning that there is such a large segment of the adult population in this country without proper financial planning tools. In a time of loss, a life insurance policy can mean the difference between having to sell the family home, pulling the kids out of college, or even, in some cases, having enough money to put food on the table. I want to commend the National Association of Insurance and Financial  Advisors and the Life Insurance Foundation for Education as well as more than 100 insurance companies for their effort to raise consumer awareness of the important role that life insurance products can play in helping families plan their financial futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that so many of our local financial advisors and financial institutions are already actively involved in helping South Dakotans increase savings and plan financial contingencies for unexpected events. By designating September 2007 as "Life Insurance Awareness Month," I hope that the increased national attention on this issue will further encourage people across America to achieve financial security for themselves and their loved ones.</paragraph>

  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas life insurance is an essential part of a sound financial plan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas life insurance provides financial security for families by helping surviving members meet immediate and long-term financial obligations and objectives in the event of a premature death in their family;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas approximately 68,000,000 United States citizens lack the adequate level of life insurance coverage needed to ensure a secure financial future for their loved ones;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas life insurance products protect against the uncertainties of life by enabling individuals and families to manage the financial risks of premature death, disability, and long-term care; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas numerous groups supporting life insurance have designated September 2007 as "National Life Insurance Awareness Month" as a means to encourage consumers to take the actions necessary to achieve financial security for their loved ones: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals of "National Life Insurance Awareness Month"; and</chair>
