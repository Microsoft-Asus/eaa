  <narrative>THE FARM BILL -- (Senate - December 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15643">S15643</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan for summarizing the important issues we worked on today that help the American people. We are grateful for her work on these issues and her great leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to speak just for a few minutes, probably less than 2 minutes, about the farm bill. It is hard to do that because it is such a massive piece of legislation, but suffice it to say that I think when we came to this Congress a year ago--it was a brandnew Congress--we said we were going to focus on change in a new direction. I think the change we have tried to bring is a change of priorities, really. I think this farm bill is evidence of that. It is also a bipartisan effort, the whole list  of things you have already heard on the specialty crops for States such as Pennsylvania, a brandnew part of the farm bill, whether it is the help that our dairy farmers in Pennsylvania will receive--not nearly enough help; we have more work to do there but certainly some new changes there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy title is so important to create the jobs of the future but also reduce our dependance on foreign sources of energy. The conservation and the reform efforts that were made here are important. To highlight something in the nutrition title in this bill, there is more than $5 billion of new money for nutrition, so needed by families across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think we can be very proud, and I wanted to say how much I appreciate the work of the whole Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. Chairman TOM HARKIN did a wonderful job. The ranking member, Senator Chambliss, spoke before about Senator Conrad's contribution as the Budget chair, also sits on our Agriculture Committee. I am grateful that so much work went into this for the people, in my case, of Pennsylvania but also for the people of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I turn the microphone over to one of our fellow committee members, and, like the Presiding Officer, a fellow freshman, Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, who will be coming after me, I want to say one word about the President's veto this week, yet again, the second time, of the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, he is wrong. Once again, he is going counter to the bipartisan effort in America but especially here in Washington when it comes to parties trying to work together where we could cover 10 million American children. Once again, the President has stepped in front of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in this season of hope, this holiday season, the President has made it much more difficult now to cover 10 million American children. It is a mistake. It is bad for the country. It is certainly bad for those children. But in the long run, it is bad for our future economy. I think the President should talk to members of both parties and try to work something out to get 10 million children in America covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
