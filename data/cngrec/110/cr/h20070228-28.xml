    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for my bill, <bill type="h" number="997">H.R. 997</bill>, inadvertently and by obvious mistake, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) was listed as a cosponsor of the bill in error instead of the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). I would ask unanimous consent that we grant the request of both gentlemen, that the gentleman from North Carolina's name could be removed from <bill type="h" number="997">H.R. 997</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would apologize to both the gentlemen from North Carolina and Georgia who are named Mr. Price.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa?</chair>
