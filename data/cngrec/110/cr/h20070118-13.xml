    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the commonsense energy debate that we are going to have today in regard to the bill that we are proposing. Being from the Midwest and from Ohio, I truly believe that our energy costs in Ohio are one of our most significant problems with why we haven't been able to do as much business development as we would like to.  We have the opportunity right now instead of paying  royalties to the companies that are providing us with our energy, we can now invest in alternatives ways of finding resources to be able to provide the energy for our people and to stimulate the business growth, especially in Ohio and hopefully in America as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to realize that we have the opportunities to burn ethanol. I am excited about the fact that certainly in my area we have an abundance of coal, and with clean coal technology we can create more energy. We have the opportunity now, Mr. Speaker, to look at coal-to-liquid fuel as an alternative to lessen our dependency on foreign oil. I truly believe that this is a move in the right direction, Mr. Speaker, and something that will help. I am looking forward to resolving the energy  problems of our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reserving my right to object, could the Speaker tell me why we are limiting 1-minutes to five per side, yet we are getting out today in the middle of the day at 2 o'clock?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will accept that for an answer. I just wanted to ask the question and make sure that we understood that we are.</paragraph>
