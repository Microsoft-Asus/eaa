    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3308">H.R. 3308</bill>, which names a postal facility in Atwood, Indiana, after Lance Corporal David K. Fribley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3308">H.R. 3308</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Mark Souder on August 1, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Indiana congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Marine Lance Corporal David K. Fribley was killed in action on March 23, 2003, near Nasiriyah, Iraq. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Fribley earned a degree from Indiana State University in recreation and sports management. He was working at a retirement home in Fort Myers, Florida, a job he loved, when the terrorist attacks occurred on September 11, 2001. Mr. Fribley joined the Marines. He wrote in a letter to his parents: "Right now, I'm sure I'm where God wants me to be."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal Fribley served his country with honor and distinction. He gave the ultimate sacrifice, and America is eternally grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleague, Representative MARK SOUDER, for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are probably no things more upsetting to Members of Congress than to know that the difficult decisions we have made here have resulted in the deaths of young men and women in battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal David Fribley was actually the first Hoosier killed in action in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. One of the good things that we have seen in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been a number of post offices and various things being named after these young patriots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was earlier at a dedication of a football field in Warsaw, Indiana, named Fribley Field, where the community went together and put together a statue and a number of things in tribute for him and his family and renamed the  field and redid the field so that kids could continue to play athletics as he did in Warsaw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is actually from Atwood. His parents are Gary and Linda. He has a brother, Steve, and a sister, Ann.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Atwood is a very small town, not that Warsaw is all that big, in the big scheme of things, but Atwood is a very small town, similar to the one I grew up in, probably about 500 people or thereabouts, between 500 and 1,000, at most. It is on U.S. 30. Many people may go by it. Be careful if you do, there is usually often a policeman there who tries to catch people in a speed trap. The town is just a little ways away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is a big moment for Atwood. One of their stars that came out went to Warsaw High School; and even though he went to Warsaw High School, he was known as an Atwood boy. Warsaw is a large consolidated high school in the area, and all the small towns know their individuals there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vicky Romine, the postmaster in Atwood, requested this from our office and said, because he was an Atwood boy, they wanted to name their post office after him. The three county commissioners in Kosciusko County, Brad Jackson, Ronald Truex and Bob Conley, all sent letters of support to rename this post office after Lance Corporal David Fribley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He graduated from high school in 1996, where he was an all-conference football player and a track and field star. He was on the track and field team at Indiana State from 1996 to 1998 and placed sixth in the shot put at the 1998 Missouri Valley Conference Indoor and Outdoor Championships. He went on to graduate with a bachelor's degree in recreational-business administration from Indiana State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After college he moved to Fort Myers, Florida, where he began organizing activities for retirees at the Shell Point Retirement Community until September 11, 2001. Right after 9/11, he joined the Marine Corps, saying, "The greatest gift one can give another is the gift of service. The following is my gift to you and others. With all the strength of my fellow marines, we shall always provide you with the comforting feeling of safety that you have each day."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In 2003, he was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On March 23, 2003, he died during a battle near Nasiriyah. He became the first Hoosier killed in action in support of Iraqi Operation Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Fribley was always ready to pitch in, friends and family say. When an uncle took sick, he mowed his aunt's lawn. When a cousin wanted to attend Indiana State, he took her to the sprawling campus, showed her shortcuts and introduced her around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of his fraternity brothers at Indiana State said: "David was one of those simple, gentle people. You could ask him to do anything, and he would stop what he was doing and help you. He was one of those people that I trusted with everything. I could go to him with a problem. I could go to him with an issue, and he would always come through."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
