    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that on June 11, I was unable to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of <bill type="sj" number="14">S.J. Res. 14</bill>, a joint resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and of the American people. I wish to address this vote, so that the people of the great State of Kansas, who elected me to serve them as U.S. Senator, may know my position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding vote No. 207, I would not have voted in favor of the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of <bill type="sj" number="14">S.J. Res. 14</bill>. My vote would not have altered the result of this motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
