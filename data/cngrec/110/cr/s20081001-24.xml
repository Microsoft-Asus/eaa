    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of the most upstanding and intellectually accomplished law firms in the country on its historic 100 years in practice. Yes, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the premier regional law firm of Martin and Seibert L.C., which has offices in Martinsburg and Charleston, WV, Winchester, VA, and Hagerstown, MD. The firm, founded in 1908, offers an extraordinarily high level of professional, competent, and courteous  service. Nestled in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia and surrounding environs, it is respected throughout the area. I would like to ask my esteemed colleague, Senator Rockefeller, if he shares my appreciation of the unique history and many accomplishments of this exemplary firm?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Let me assure the Senator that I am very well aware of the numerous and considerable contributions that have been made by the law firm of Martin and Seibert L.C. over the past century. The grandfather of one of the firm's current top partners, Clarence E. Martin III, was an American original. The first Clarence E. Martin was what one might call "the real deal." Not only an astonishing legal mind, he was also a pioneer, a leader, and was knighted by two Popes for his service  to the church and community, a tradition that has been carried on by subsequent members of the firm. Clarence E. Martin not only founded Martin and Seibert L.C., but was one of only two West Virginians, and the only practicing West Virginia lawyer ever, to serve as president of the American Bar Association, ABA, from 1932 to 1933.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Martin and Seibert L.C. has grown surely and steadily over the past century. Clarence Martin founded the firm along with Cleveland M. Seibert. These two men brought national attention to West Virginia, and the solid foundation they built for Martin &amp; Seibert, L.C. remains evident today. The firm constantly strives to provide both the best possible service for its clients, and responsible leadership for its community.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I know that my esteemed colleague, Senator Rockefeller, joins me in taking this opportunity to congratulate Martin and Seibert L.C. on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of their firm. May God grant them many more years of success and service to the people of West Virginia and surrounding localities.</paragraph>
