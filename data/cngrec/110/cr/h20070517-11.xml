  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, last night the House adopted the Altmire-Udall amendment to provide military families with very simple but much needed support while loved ones are away on combat duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the amendment that was agreed to, a worker can take family and medical leave to deal with the issues that arise as a result of a spouse, parent, or child's deployment to a combat zone like Iraq or Afghanistan. Under this amendment family members can use the leave to take care of issues like making legal and financial arrangements and making child care arrangements or other family obligations that arise and double when family members are on active duty deployments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting the troops is more than a bumper sticker. We must support the troops with all of the support that they need so their families can continue to function during the difficult times of deployment. These deployments and extended tours are not easy on families, and two-parent households can suddenly become a single-parent household and one parent is left alone to deal with paying the bills, going to the bank, picking up the kids from school, watching the kids, providing emotional support  to the rest of the family. You have got to deal with these predeployment preparations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is a good amendment. I hope that the House will support it with the passage of the legislation. Last year, tragically, it was thrown out in the conference committee and was given no consideration by the majority party of the last Congress.</paragraph>
