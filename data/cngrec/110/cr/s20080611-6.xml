  <narrative>HIGH COST OF ENERGY -- (Senate - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5461">S5461</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when President Bush took office, one of the airplanes flying us to the west coast, or to the Midwest, or to the southern part of the States from Washington, DC, the cost of a tank of fuel for that airplane was 15 percent of the overall cost of the airline. Today, after 7 years and 6 months of President Bush, it now costs those airline companies almost 50 percent of the total costs. So it has gone from 15 percent to almost 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All over America, airlines are eliminating flights that are full. Why? Because those airplanes cost too much to run. Every airplane flying across America today is losing money--every commercial airline--because the cost of fuel is so high. Think about that. Eighty-five percent of the cost of an airline could be other things when President Bush took office; now it is 50 percent. Airlines are in deep trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat, airplanes taking off from Washington, DC, or other places in America, and are full, with every seat taken, those flights are being eliminated because that type of airplane uses too much fuel. They are doing everything they can to eliminate the need for extra fuel. They are hosing down airplanes to save a quart of fuel here and there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a desperate situation that the American airline industry has. In addition, our airlines are having difficulty competing with the European airlines. They pay in euros; we pay in dollars. We pay approximately, let's say, $1.40 per gallon--we know that is wrong, but the mathematical calculation is the same--and Europe pays about 80 cents. We cannot compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when President Bush took office, a gallon of gasoline in a motor vehicle was less than $1.50. Now, this morning, it is announced that the average cost in America is over $4.05 a gallon. That is what has happened during the Bush administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The day before yesterday, I met with the National Association of Manufacturers. The biggest concern they have is the cost of energy. One relatively small American manufacturer who has been quite successful--totally American--said this year, so far he has to  borrow or come up with another $6 million--he doesn't know where he is going to get it--just to take care of the problems attributed to rising energy cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of all this, in spite of the problems we face in America today with gasoline, people are trying to take public transportation when they can, but in rural America there is very little public transportation. Vacations are being stopped. In spite of all this, yesterday, the Republicans stopped us from going forward on legislation that would ease some of the problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in the matter we are talking about when morning business closes, we think it is time to look at the subsidies the oil companies get. During the past year, they made about $250 billion in profits--net profits. Yet we subsidize these oil companies. We believe that should be looked at closely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also believe we should look at a windfall profits tax. We also believe--and there is bipartisan support for this; Senator Specter talked about this, and Senator Kohl is our major mover on this issue on this side--OPEC scholars believe, and members of our Judiciary Committee believe they  are violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. But there is a question as to whether they are subject to that. What these Senators and others want to do--and that is part of our legislation--is make them subject to the antitrust laws in this country. They make most of their money in America. Why shouldn't our laws apply? We were stopped from going forward to debate that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a school of thought today that believes the problems with the cost of oil are based on speculation--pure speculation. If the Presiding Officer wanted to leave and buy a share of General Motors or Ford stock--and Kirk Kerkorian is buying about 1 billion dollars' worth of Ford stock today--if you want to buy stock in Ford or General Motors today, you would have to put up 50 cents, which is your margin, for every dollar you buy. But not with oil. Some margins with oil are 3 to 5 percent.  There is a lot of speculation going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We wanted to take a look at that but, no, the Republicans said: We are not even going to let you legislate on that matter. It seems to me that is what we should do. If they don't like our proposal, let's do something they think would be appropriate. Let's legislate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it is pretty clear we cannot produce our way out of the problems we have with energy. Take ANWR and all of the offshore, and we in America have about 3 percent of the oil in the world. So it is obvious we cannot do that. Can we do a better job in production? Of course we can. We do certain things, and we have done certain things, such as allowing more offshore drilling off the coast of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer to all of this is not drill, drill, drill. The answer is to do something to help save our world. Global warming is here because we have taken, for well more than a century, carbon out of the Earth and put it into the sky. It has caused our Earth to be sick. We have a fever. Global warming is here. So we not only have to face this issue and recognize we don't need more fossil fuel, we need alternative renewable energy. That is what we tried to move to yesterday. The Republicans would  not let us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have entrepreneurs in America who want to invest money in renewable energy--the Sun, the wind, geothermal. They want to invest, and we want to be able to give them tax credits as incentives. But, no, not with this Republican minority, not with this Republican President. The answer is no, no, no to directly affecting energy costs and doing something to allow us to move to renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If that weren't enough, yesterday, to show what is going on with the Republicans and to indicate to the American people why they keep losing these special elections--one in Illinois, one in Louisiana, and one in Mississippi--look what they are doing. Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee had a hearing on torture to find out why America--the United States of America--why we were torturing people who were being picked up for being suspected terrorists. All we wanted to do is hold a hearing. No. In  the Senate, if you don't want a hearing to go forward, and we have been in session for more than 2 hours, you can stop it. So we had to recess the Senate to go ahead with the hearing anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They do not even want us to do oversight. So we are going to come today and talk about the calamity facing America with the oil prices. The Presiding Officer and I just left a meeting of people concerned about food--food. Senator Dorgan from North Dakota indicated that the cost of fertilizer in the small, sparsely populated State of North Dakota, in 1 year, has gone from $400 million to $800 million. Those farmers are trying to figure out a way to pay for that. People all around that  table were people concerned about food. The problem is energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet in the Senate, we are not allowed to debate that because Republicans want to maintain the status quo. The status quo will not be maintained much longer. We may have to put up with President Bush and his policies for 7 months, if he is not willing to work with us. We may have to put up with the obstructionism of the Republicans for another 7 months, but the day is going to change come November when the elections are held because we will no longer have the slim majority we have now, and we  will be able to legislate for the American people.</paragraph>
