  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to clarify why I am objecting to the passage of <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, the Presidential Library</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, I supported a bill very similar to this. I have always supported transparency in these matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is in the fairness of passing this legislation today. When this legislation was introduced at the very beginning of this administration's tenure, I supported it because it would have provided sufficient notice to the new administration of a change in reporting requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this administration's final term is near an en d, and I do not believe it is fair to change the rules on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has complied with the existing procedures. Changing them now would put a greater burden on them than any other past administration which already finished collecting the majority of donations for their libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enacting this bill to apply only to future administrations would solve this problem, and put them on notice of the new reporting requirements and procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have an amendment to this bill so that it wi ll be enacted only to apply to administrations serving on or after January 21, 2009. If this amendment is accepted, I will be happy to support the legislation.</paragraph>
