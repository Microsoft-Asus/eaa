    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the liberal leadership of this House will call up <bill type="h" number="980">H.R. 980</bill>, the Public Safety Employee-Employer Cooperation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It sounds harmless. But let's not mince words. This bill is not concerned with public safety. It's a payoff from the left to the powerful labor unions that finance many of their campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The liberal leadership already bowed to union pressure by passing legislation to strip workers of the right to vote in a private ballot election. Now they are attempting to federalize collective bargaining for public safety professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Association of Chiefs of Police opposes the legislation because it would effectively take power from State and local governments during labor-management relations. I oppose it because it will likely make our communities less safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is a time and there is a place for politics, but not when our lives and the safety of our communities is at stake.</paragraph>
