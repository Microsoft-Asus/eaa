    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Employee Free Choice Act. It is natural to believe, as most Americans do, that since workplace elections have secret ballots, they are similar to the elections we have for municipal, State and national offices. Unfortunately, choosing to join a union is not like the choices we all make at voting booths in November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans rightly expect not to be fired or harassed for the way they vote. They do not expect to hear that their jobs may be shipped overseas or that they may lose their health care coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, the law gives employers that oppose unions with illegal means a chance to do such things. Employers that want to fire or threaten the union-friendly worker can calculate ahead of time that it will only cost them a few thousand dollars in fines if they are caught. And wronged employees might not be reinstated for years, long after the union effort has run its course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other tactics are legal but unfair, such as mandatory meetings for employees to listen to their employer's antiunion views with no similar opportunities for unions to respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Workers are subject to intimidation so effective that many are afraid to vote for a union against the wishes of their employer, even in private, even in a secret ballot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One study recently conducted by the University of Illinois found that 30 percent of employers fire prounion workers, 49 percent threaten to close a workplace, and 51 percent coerce employees with bribes or favoritism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These acts are not legal under the National Labor Relations Act, but the fines are so paltry and the legal process so slow that unscrupulous employers are undeterred. People are afraid to vote for a union because they are afraid to lose their jobs and because the law does not adequately protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are not the kind of elections Americans expect at their polling places. The Employee Free Choice Act would bring our workplaces closer to the democratic ideals we do expect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act would strengthen employees' ability to choose. It would discourage the firing of employees by increasing fines and penalties during the election process. It would require mediation and arbitration to end delays and make sure that the first contract negotiations do not drag out for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act would also replace secret ballots with a card check procedure in which a majority of workers, not just the majority of voters, sign cards authorizing a union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is it so important to ensure access to unions? Inequality is rising in our country. Two years ago, Alan Greenspan said, "A free-market society is ill-served by an economy in which the rewards are distributed in a way which too many of our population do not feel is appropriate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether or not you believe that increasing inequality in our country is tied to declining union membership, one thing is clear. Union workers have better rates of health care coverage, better wages, and are five times more likely to have a pension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to health care, better wages, secure pensions, these are things Congress is trying to give back to the middle class in America. Making our economy work for everyone is a complicated, ongoing process. I believe the Employee Free Choice Act is one important step toward accomplishing that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In most American workplaces, the process of forming a union is contentious. Yet, though they may differ over issues like wages, health care and pension benefits, employers, employees, supervisors and company owners are all striving for the same goal: American competitiveness in a global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finding a middle ground on the question of compensation, training and health care boosts American productivity, innovation and competitiveness. By giving the lion's share of the power to employers, we not only cheat workers, we cheat our economic future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach 2020, our income distribution is trending toward 1920. Americans do not want to be left to the market-based whims of health savings  accounts, privatized Social Security, or personal job retraining accounts. They want a government that helps individuals provide for themselves and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Wagner wrote the National Labor Relations Act in 1934 to ensure that workers would have an unambiguous, unmitigated right to representation in the workplace. He said then that "the denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us give Americans a fair shot at organizing again. They deserve protection under the law. I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act.</paragraph>
