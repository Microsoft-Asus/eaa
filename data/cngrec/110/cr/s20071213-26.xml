    <paragraph>Mr. President, on October 9, 2007, a beloved Idahoan passed away.

She was small in stature but strong in her direction and devotion. She was a friend of mine and, together with her husband of 51 years, Fred Kelly Grant, worked closely with me in recent years on the Owyhee Initiative.

    <paragraph>When Lodice retired from the church in 2003, she continued her staunch support of her husband's work as legal counsel for Owyhee County; they both made improving Owyhee County the capstone of their labor and life's work over the past few years. Lodice was a pillar of strength for her entire family. Her influence for good and her acts of service benefited countless people who loved her and will miss her energy, friendship, and spirit. She tended people in the same way she lovingly tended her beautiful  yard and garden--with tenderness, careful attention, and tireless devotion. I was blessed to know her, and I offer my heartfelt condolences to Fred, their children Andy and Jon, five grandchildren, and family and friends during this difficult time.</paragraph>
