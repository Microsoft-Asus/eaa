    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor, as many of us have today, the Veterans Day this weekend that's coming up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has spent a lot of time this week talking about veterans. We've talked about how this Congress provided the largest increase in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. We've debated which side cares more about veterans and who's to blame for the delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the American people can see who really is holding up the latest VA appropriations bill, but I'm here to remind each and every Member of Congress that, as you go home this weekend and speak to veterans and their families in their district, to honor them, ask yourself what have you done to honor your pledge to our veterans and their loved ones?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the President also takes a hard look in the mirror before he decides on how he intends to honor veterans on Veterans Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to remember that in honoring our country's veterans that you cannot honor a veteran without honoring their families. They don't come alone. They have parents. They have loved ones. They have children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the bill that takes care of that is the bill that we're voting on today, which is the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. In order to support veterans, you've got to support their family. Be family friendly, vote for the appropriations bill.</paragraph>
