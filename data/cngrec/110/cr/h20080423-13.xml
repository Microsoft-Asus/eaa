    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices keep going up, and Americans want some answers and some action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One reason gasoline is rising is because the U.S. dollar continues to get weaker. The weaker it gets, the more it costs to buy that crude oil from the OPEC monopoly and the dictator of Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another reason is the U.S. is the only major nation that ignores its own natural resources. This stubborn, hard-headed Congress refuses to let American oil companies drill offshore. Plus, subsidizing the corn industry to make ethanol has driven world food prices to an all-time high; and now, African nations are even going hungry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have crude oil in all of these red zones outside the United States. But environmental intimidation and fear tactics prevent drilling in this gold mine of crude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We only drill off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The rest of these red zones don't have a problem taking that crude oil and gasoline, but they say "No!" to drilling off their shore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless we drill offshore and in ANWR, we are all going to be walking to work, and come winter, freezing in the dark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
