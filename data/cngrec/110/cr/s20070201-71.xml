    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have been in touch with Senator Kerry's office today--in fact, just this minute--and he does say there is some confusion in this regard. He has spoken to Senator Snowe. Because of this confusion at this time, I have no alternative but to seek adoption of the unanimous consent request regarding the small business matter that I enunciated some time ago.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the Republican leader bringing this to my attention. I personally will work on this tomorrow.</paragraph>
