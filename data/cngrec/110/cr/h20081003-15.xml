    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is a historic day in the United States Congress as the President has called on us to meet the challenge of the failure of the mortgage market, and our failure to do that would not only cause a crisis in the United States but throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Seven hundred billion dollars we've asked to expose the taxpayers to from an administration that all I've heard in the last 8 years is that we have to keep government out of the free market, that government and regulations would strangle our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the fact is that in such a short period of time, had it not been for Barney Frank and people on the other side of the aisle in trying to do the best we can, we leave here with a heavy conscience that if we do nothing then the sacrifice will be felt by employees, their thrift accounts, their savings accounts, and small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in a sense, we have a political gun at our heads that we can't afford to say that we know better, and so most of us have agreed that Secretary Paulson and economists have given us fair warning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that's enough and it's complicated enough, but then we have had the threat of tax bills that expire at the end of the year. Companies that have relied on tax credits, individuals who relied on it, expire. And four times we sent energy bills to the other body, and four times they've ignored it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Included in these bills, of course, has always been disaster relief, and all of us believe these people should get it; mental health parity, which God knows all of us that have any sensitivity recognize that this inequity has to be taken care of; and of course, the alternative minimum tax, that no Member in this House or the other body can ever explain to taxpayers why this over $60 billion burden should fall on their shoulders because the Congress didn't think far enough ahead in order to adjust  this tax for inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so in a sense, Madam Speaker, we're being told that the burden would fall on 25 million people by the Senate, by our constituents and the country and entire world, by the administration if we don't have this $700 billion rescue bill. And I just hope and pray that sometime historically we might be able to regain the power that we used to have in the House, introduce bills, have hearings, and fully understand what we're doing rather than having to yield to the threat of disaster, whether it's  fiscal or whether it's tax liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see John Tanner walking on the floor, and I do want to say that he's an outstanding member of our committee. He's been talking about the deficit for a long time, and his contribution to this package, I'd like to point out, has made him a proud member of our committee and the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume, and it won't be much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a little over 20 years ago, I made my first speech on the floor of the House of Representatives. Today could very well be my last speech on the floor of the House. I hope it's not. I hope we come back in a lame duck session to consider pending trade legislation, but this could be my last speech. And I had a real stemwinder prepared, Madam Speaker, but unfortunately, we only have 15 minutes of time that Ways and Means controls, and I have many more speakers than I have time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, with the Speaker's indulgence, I will submit my remarks for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on May 5, 1988, during Floor debate on a defense authorization bill, I rose as a freshman Member to address this House for the very first time, urging my colleagues to support an amendment in the name of fiscal responsibility. My very first words on the Floor that day warned of the dangers of the growing national debt. Over the two decades since, I've made scores of speeches and cast more than 11,000 votes in this historic chamber, representing the hardworking taxpayers of Louisiana  to the best of my ability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I certainly hope we can return in November to complete action on our unfinished trade agenda, Madam Speaker, I rise today for what may be my final Floor speech as a Member of this body. As someone who has spent his entire career fighting for smaller government, freer markets, and greater economic liberty for all Americans, it is sadly ironic that I speak today in favor of a plan that, on its surface, appears to run counter to those principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Madam Speaker, this proposal seems to undermine the very foundations of capitalism, upending the economic incentives that drive entrepreneurial risk-taking. In America, we rightly celebrate our freedom to succeed in economic ventures. But in America, we're also supposed to be free to fail in those ventures, without expectation of a bailout from fellow taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By rushing in with $700 billion in taxpayer dollars to address the current crisis, I fear we are greatly increasing the moral hazard associated with economic risk-taking. I resent the level of government interference in the private market we see in this bill, and I hope it does not set a precedent that Congress follows in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite my grave concerns about this proposal, Madam Speaker, the weight of the evidence says we need to act--not to bail out the Wall Street titans, but instead to stabilize the credit markets upon which Main Street depends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over recent weeks, I have listened carefully to experts on all sides of this issue, to constituents with a variety of strongly-held views, and to the voice of the U.S. Senate, which passed this emergency plan on Wednesday by a 74-25 vote. On balance, I am convinced that the Treasury Secretary needs to have appropriate authority to halt our Nation's slide into what could become a profound and extended economic downturn. If that were to occur and our financial markets were to collapse, I believe  it could open the door to even more government interference in the private marketplace and to even less economic freedom for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not let that happen. The stakes are simply too high, and the risks to our economy, and our freedoms, are just too great. The circumstances are exigent, Madam Speaker, and, in my judgment, we need to act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to three tax provisions contained in the financial rescue portion of the bill--provisions dealing with the treatment of executive compensation, capital losses incurred by banks holding preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the tax exclusion for forgiven debt on home mortgages--the bill before us also includes the Senate's comprehensive tax extenders package. This is a positive development, Madam Speaker, because the Senate's tax package provides more than $107 billion  in net tax relief to U.S. families and businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With enactment of this bill, we will finally resolve the tax dispute that has divided Republicans and Democrats for the entirety of the 110th Congress, delaying action on the AMT patch and other tax extenders, including a variety of energy-related tax incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 2 years, Republicans have insisted that we should not have to raise taxes to prevent the tax increases that would result from the scheduled expiration of existing tax law. Democrats, meanwhile, have insisted that the House's paygo rules require us to find offsets for extensions of expired or expiring tax law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This comprehensive package--previously approved as a free-standing bill by the other body by an overwhelming vote of 93 to 2--represents a bipartisan compromise, much like the financial rescue plan to which it has been attached. It contains extenders provisions that are not fully offset--as many Democrats would prefer--but contains more offsets than many Republicans would like, including some on domestic oil and gas producers that I find particularly troubling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is certainly not a perfect package, Madam Speaker, but with adjournment looming, it is the only package that can pass both chambers and actually be enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this package will protect millions of middle-class taxpayers from falling victim to the AMT in 2008. It provides more than $48 billion in tax relief by extending through  2009 various expired and expiring provisions affecting U.S. families and businesses. And it contains an $18 billion package of energy-related tax incentives, including the creation of a new tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package also contains a set of disaster-related tax relief provisions, including both nationwide tax relief and targeted tax relief for the victims of this summer's Midwestern storms and for victims of Hurricane Ike in Louisiana and Texas. Finally, the Senate's comprehensive tax package contains several non-tax provisions of significant interest to many Members on both sides of the aisle, including mental health parity and a reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All in all, this is a good, bipartisan package of tax proposals, Madam Speaker, and I think its inclusion improves the overall financial rescue package before us by providing important tax relief to our nation's families and businesses at a critical time for our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, I will cast my vote for this economic stabilization plan, sobered by the reality that our failure to act could have unprecedented, catastrophic consequences for our country and the economic freedoms for which I've long fought as a Member of this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished minority whip, Mr. Blunt of Missouri.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm glad we're here at this work today. I do think that the bill has improved and the situation has clarified from Monday. We need to come together. We need to get this work done. It's incredibly important. It seems to me that two significant things have happened: one, the changes in the bill that others will talk about and I will talk about a little bit; and two, the changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Accounting Standards Board that have set forth a new way to evaluate  these assets that are causing so much trouble in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, where I live, nobody talks about illiquid assets. They talk about mortgages. They talk about how to pay the bills. They talk about whether they can borrow money or not, and at the end of the day, Madam Speaker, that's what this bill is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not about Wall Street. It's about Main Street. It's not a bailout. It's a situation where American taxpayers are going to invest money in a way that ensures they have a return. I think with the work we've done here, we've not only ensured that they're likely is never likely to be a question of return, but beyond that, if at the end of 5 years taxpayers would appear have lost any money, the President will propose and Congress will act on a set of recommendations that go back to the agencies  that participated and say we're going to recover whatever was lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a chance where American taxpayers are investing in their own future. This is an opportunity where people are helping stabilize a market. We saw a bank purchase this week where it looked like the government would have to be part of the purchase, but after the government came in and said here's how we're going to work to stabilize the situation, suddenly there's a market and suddenly that purchase is much different than it would have been without government participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill allows that kind of stabilization. This bill protects taxpayers. This bill has every known oversight mechanism ever conceived of by government in it now. None of those were asked for initially by the administration but they're all there now, a special Inspector General, a board that sets policy, a congressional oversight group, GAO with special authority, ultimate transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill the taxpayers can look at and say this is well beyond the proposal that came to the Congress. It has a transparency. It has the oversight. It has the guarantees that taxpayers should ask for, but it also has lots of options, options that weren't in the original proposal, not just to loan money, not just to purchase mortgages and other securities, but to set up an insurance plan so if that's one of the things that would make more sense in certain areas it can be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a critical moment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I'd like to put in the Record, Madam Speaker, a letter I received from the Secretary of the Treasury talking about the rules and regulations that they will pursue that will assure that eligible financial institutions must be established and regulated to have significant operations in the United States. It's not talking about foreign banks. Also requiring that--in the letter that they will set up rules and regulations so that people participating in this program won't benefit  from this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 2, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. Blunt: I am writing regarding the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act requires that eligible financial institutions must be established and regulated and have significant operations in the United States. Furthermore, it is the intention of the Department of the Treasury that all mortgages or mortgage-related assets purchased in the Troubled Asset Relief Program will be based on or related to properties in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act requires the Department of the Treasury to prevent unjust enrichment of financial institutions selling troubled assets into the Troubled Asset Relief Program, including preventing the sale of a troubled asset to the Treasury at a higher price than what the seller paid to purchase the asset. The Act specifies a single exemption for troubled assets acquired in a merger or acquisition or a purchase of assets from a financial institution that is established and regulated in the United States  and that is in conservatorship, receivership or bankruptcy. The Department of the Treasury believes this exemption is important to encouraging healthy institutions to pursue acquisitions of struggling institutions. Such acquisitions help to protect depositors, taxpayers and the financial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of the Treasury will issue regulations or guidelines necessary to address and manage or to prohibit conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the administration and execution of the authorities provided under the Act as soon as practicable after the date of enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I had no idea that we would be coming back here and I would have this opportunity, but for some of us being Members of Congress, and especially members of the Ways and Means Committee, it has been a special privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic committee, however, has had its ups and downs with partisanship, the likes of which we had not seen on the committee or in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hardly knew Jim McCrery during the years he was on the committee because the other side was dominated by one personality, but as soon as things changed and I had the opportunity to meet and talk with him as the ranking member, I not only found a scholar and a gentleman, but I found someone who loved his country and Congress more than he loved the partisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't as though we have been able to resolve many of the crises that exist in our committee, but the one thing that he did do, and it will continue after he leaves us, is to create a climate where we had a degree of respect for each other and especially when we needed that respect, when we disagree and our parties disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His legacy, even though he leaves, will continue to know that in this House no matter how frank we are politically, we still can be civil. We still can get things done, and even when we're not successful, we can work in such a manner that other people following us would know that we can disagree without being disagreeable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Jim, I speak for all of the Democrats on the committee, for the tone, for your congeniality, for your humor, for the wisdom that you contributed, and I know that it's been awkward for your party and mine at times to do the things that we wanted to do. We started off dealing with the Secretary Treasurer and we promised him we'd do the world. Unfortunately, we didn't check with our leadership on a lot of things that we thought we could do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we will continue to do that, and I do hope that the lessons that you taught so many of us will continue long after you're gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished chairman of the Health Subcommittee, who's worked hard on the overall bill before us today, Chairman Pete Stark from California.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and unfortunately, I have to urge my colleagues to vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somebody in the press not so long ago earlier this week said eight out of 10 of my colleagues know nothing about economics or banking, and this bill shows that he was quite right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does nothing but bail out Wall Street and large corporate America. It spends $800 billion that the taxpayers will end up having to pay for, and it does nothing for middle Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is there a crisis in this country? Yes, there is, but there is not a crisis for those people who have been working, trying to pay their bills. There's not a crisis for your average community bank who has no problem with liquidity. There is not a crisis for your credit cards being unable to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's Paulson's way to scare us, as Colin Powell tried to scare us some years ago by saying if we didn't vote for an ill-conceived war we'd see terrorists on the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're getting the same kind of misinformation now, the same kind of rush to judgment to tell you that a crisis will occur. It won't. Vote "no." Come back and help work on a bill that will help all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to first say how much I appreciate the very kind words of the gentleman from New York and appreciate very much the opportunity to have worked with him over the last couple of years. He has been more than gracious to me and to all the members of the committee, and so his words were heartfelt, and I very much appreciate them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400076" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Louisiana for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, I voted "no" on this bill for two reasons. Number one, I don't like to hurriedly vote on significant legislation. I'd rather do it thoroughly and deliberately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second reason, my telephone calls and e-mails were overwhelming in opposition against the bill. On Monday I voted "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The telephone calls and e-mails continued to be overwhelming, but guess what: Then in favor of the bill. Now I'm not exclusively dictated by telephone calls and e-mails, but neither do I dismiss them, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And I weighed this very carefully. And by having waited, I think we did improve the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increase of the FDIC threshold to $250,000, a good move; the AMT patch that will affect favorably 21 million middle class families, a good move; SEC, I am told, Madam Speaker, is addressing or has addressed the mark-to-market issue, a good approach. Compelling arguments can be proffered on both sides of this issue, but I believe, Madam Speaker, that inaction is not an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't believe the sky is falling. I was told that earlier and I refuted it. And I think when I disagree with the sky falling charge, that's not irregular for me to refute it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this vote for me, I am voting "aye" today, and it may be politically damaging. And the sky may fall tomorrow, but it will fall upon my head; it won't fall upon anyone else's, and no one else will be adversely affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the limited access to credit--and in many instances no access to credit--can certainly contribute to a crisis. And we can put on blinders and go one way or the other, but I think this is a bill that must be addressed today, it must be addressed in a positive way, both sides of the aisle. My friends to the left, my friends on this side have done a good job, I think, in crafting it, and I am pleased to announce that I am voting "aye" when the vote is called later.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="">
    <paragraph>First, let me thank Congressman Frank; he did a good job under very difficult circumstances, as did Mr. Rangel with the tax extenders that are part of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is imperfect legislation, like much legislation that comes to the floor of this House, but we need to pass it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national principle here is at stake. If there's a hurricane in Louisiana, we all come to the aid of the American family. If there's a forest fire in California, we all come to the aid of the American family. If there's a blizzard in New England, we all come to the aid of the American family. And that's precisely what this legislation does today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, when people are having difficulty getting a car loan, trying to refinance their mortgage or looking at their 401(k) plan, we acknowledge that they are all members of the American family, and we attempt today to come to their aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is relief here for alternative minimum tax victims; 25 million people will benefit. Twelve thousand businesses are waiting for incentives for the R&amp;D credit. Four million families and three million teachers are waiting for their deductions for education expenses. Thirteen million children in low-income families can finally claim the child tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a piece of legislation that helps the American family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Camp.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I also want to commend the gentleman from Louisiana for his leadership, for his thoughtful approach to issues, for his service to the Ways and Means Committee and to the Congress, and especially for his friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>. Is this better than the original Paulson proposal? Yes. Is this bill perfect? Hardly. And this bill is better, especially for taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill resolves the remaining tax items before the Congress. After months of delay, the House will finally do what Republicans called for back in June, pass an AMT patch without increasing taxes. Without the patch, more than 25 million American families would pay an additional $62 billion in taxes. We must provide this relief sooner rather than later, and I'm pleased this will finally be done without raising taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill today, Congress will extend for 2 years the wide array of important tax credits and deductions so many families and employers rely on. We are reaffirming to the auto industry and consumers that incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles will remain law. This is something I have pushed for hard in the House. And this new plug-in credit, like the hybrid credit that I offered in 2005, will spur consumer demand for alternative vehicles and lessen our dependence  on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, we are providing certainty to businesses that are investing heavily in research and development. The Senate amendment extends the R&amp;D credit through 2009 and increases the alternative simplified credit. This is a step in the right direction. We must make the credit permanent to attract high-tech businesses and compete in today's global economy and to keep jobs here in America. Myself and Mr. Levin, my colleague from Michigan, have championed legislation to do just that,  and I look forward to making this goal a reality in the next Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support this legislation so that Congress can provide stability to our financial system and give American workers and businesses the tax relief they so desperately need and deserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to join you in thanking Mr. McCrery for his work here. I have enjoyed working with you very much, Jim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to speak about section 134 of the bill. But before I do, I've just got to say that some of us in this body are so thoroughly disgusted with the other body right now in the way this bill has been handled. We've found that it doesn't take a lot of political courage to spend somebody else's money that can't vote. And we had, from our committee, the extender package paid for or offset by people who didn't object to the offsets. And because of the Senate rules--or the other body's rules and  the ability for some over there to object to a unanimous consent request--they sent it back over here on top of a must-pass bill that is unpaid for and one of the reasons we're in the shape we're in right now. And so I just had to express utter disgust and frustration with the way that it was handled in the other body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as it comes to the bill, when the Secretary came over here with the bill, it was a bailout; it was public risk and private gain. By the wisdom of the body here, we put section 134 of the recoupment clause in which now makes it private risk and public gain, which is the way it ought to be. It is now a situation where we're not talking about bailing out Wall Street or the high flyers. If, at the end of the day, there is a shortfall in the Treasury of the United States, then they will be assessed  that shortfall and the Treasury will be made whole by section 134 of the recoupment clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the bill does now is it attempts to protect all Americans who have an IRA, a 401(k), or part of a State or local government pension plan. That's why I'm going to vote "yes" even though I am so thoroughly disgusted with what the Senate put on it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400297" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our economy has slowed to a crawl and American workers are worried about their jobs. These conditions are clear arguments for action by our government, and action should be taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question each of us needs to ask ourselves is whether or not the Paulson plan is the best course of action. In my view, it's not. I made no secret of my frustration and disapproval for the sense of panic instilled upon the public by Wall Street insiders and some of our Nation's elected leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is not a time for panic; it's a time for leadership and it's a time for deliberation. Congress must not be confined to a timetable dictated by alarmists who see the government money as their only backstop again, irresponsible lending. Investors take risks, sometimes the risks they take are reckless. Taxpayers must not be liable for Wall Street risk-taking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the American people do not accept the allegation that we have only two alternatives before us: passage of this bill or another Great Depression. There are other options if congressional leaders had the courage to allow this democracy to function. We could debate these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make certain that our Nation's lending institutions are the strongest in the world and that our constituents have confidence that they have a safe place to put their money. One way to accomplish this is to let the Fed purchase preferred shares with warrants. This would infuse capital into the market, freeing up banks to make loans and extend credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The plan that I and others have proposed to this Congress is in sharp contrast to the Paulson plan and offers real protection to the taxpayer. Why do we need to give $700 billion to one man to play hedge fund god from the gilded offices of the United States Treasury? If the Secretary wants to run a hedge fund, he should go back to Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress must not hand over such an enormous amount of money; it is simply wrong. It's irresponsible. Listen to all the pundits, all the financial wizards, the holier-than-thou capitalists from our Nation's leading institutions; they sound like they belong to the Soviet Politburo. When the markets are riding high, they want us to leave them alone. When the market crashed, they want to us nationalize their debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote "no." However, if this bill passes, it is my hope that the administration will focus first on shoring up our Nation's lending institutions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his leadership. And thanks to the leadership of Mr. Frank, Speaker Pelosi and the House Republicans, we have part of this bill before us today that is somewhat better, but it sadly adds $150 billion of largely unpaid for tax breaks, frustrating for me because many of these provisions like alternative energy too credits and secure rural schools are provisions I fought for for years and are very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as members of the public and Congress learn more about these problems and the solutions, I must say I have never seen more diametrically opposed opinions, and even people explaining about the facts in their business. But if this bill passes, which it appears that it will today, it ignores the underlying problem of a housing market in free-fall, and it ignores the plight of six million homeowners who are facing foreclosure in the next 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there was ever a time to give the same bankruptcy protection to American homeowners that Donald Trump will get the next time he takes bankruptcy for his casinos and for his fourth vacation home, that time is now. It needs to be in this legislation, and I'm sadly disappointed that it is not. In makes long term recovery harder and more painful.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, nobody in east Tennessee hates the fact more than me that I'm going to vote "yes" today after voting "no" on Monday. Monday, I cast a blue collar vote for the American people, shook the foundations of Wall Street, demanding more accountability. But today, I'm going to cast a red, white and blue collar vote with my hand over my heart for this country because things are really bad and we don't have any choice. We're out of choices, our backs are up against the wall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All week we fought for some improvements. And the increase in the FDIC limits from $100,000 to $250,000 is an improvement. The mark-to-market changes which will allow these mortgage-backed securities to move and free up liquidity will help a lot because small business people can't meet their payroll. This month, many of them in east Tennessee are not going to be able to meet their payroll. Pension funds in east Tennessee, thousands and tens of thousands of people I represent are upside down and  it's happening fast. The cost of inaction is greater than the cost of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $700 billion is a loan. Warren Buffet said Wednesday night it's a good business deal, he would take it, the government is going to get their money back. He knows more about this than anybody in this House, to be honest with you. He feels good about it. I don't like this at all. As a matter of fact, I hate it. It's disgusting that we would ever be brought to this floor to have to cast this vote, but we're out of options. We don't have a month to rewrite a new bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Things are critical. We don't even have gas at the stations in east Tennessee. Economic anxiety is hurting the families. I've been listening to small business people all week long and they said, thanks for voting "no" on Monday and thanks for standing up for us, but you've got to do something.</paragraph>

Now is the time to act. We must do something.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Jim McCrery, for your leadership throughout the years on this issue and so many other important ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Congress must act. Our Nation faces the fiercest financial crisis in our lifetime, and for lawmakers entrusted with America's prosperity to stand by and do nothing, that's no longer an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't like this bill any more than my constituents do. The thought of our interfering in the marketplace, of spending taxpayer dollars for irresponsible Wall Street firms, it makes my constituents angry and me too. But the fact of the matter is these bad loans have infected too much of America's economy and they threaten the world's economy as well. And make no mistake, if these Wall Street financial companies go down, our businesses and families in Texas are pulled down with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families in my district are already watching their life savings disappear before their eyes. I met a Texas worker. She only had $15,000 in her savings; she lost $8,000 of it over the past 2 weeks. I talked to a woman who stopped me in my car as I was leaving my neighborhood, and she said she and her husband have a small business. Their good customers can't get the credit to buy their products anymore. For the first time in 17 years since they started their business, she is truly frightened. And  I ask myself why should our local families, why should our local communities pay the price in lost jobs and lost savings because of Wall Street greed? Haven't these Wall Street companies caused enough damage?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not my solution. This is not the only solution. America faces tough times. We're going to have to come right back in November, in my opinion, and bring about the reforms to stop this from happening again. But I am going to vote "yes" again to pull this Nation back from its economic brink and protect the families and jobs and small businesses in Texas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have before us today, because of our friends in the Senate, the granddaddy of all jams. They took an incredibly important economic rescue plan and loaded it up with a bunch of extraneous, unrelated items that weren't paid for. They're in essence holding a gun to our head today daring us to vote "no." But, unfortunately, we gave them that gun last Monday because of the failure of this Chamber to act. And the credit markets are continuing to freeze up, and my concern is unless  we take action today, many innocent people back home and throughout America will suffer the consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The plan we have before us today, the rescue plan, is vastly different from the original one sent to us by the administration. Today it's about protecting Main Street, not Wall Street. It's about protecting the American taxpayer, not CEOs' salaries. We have included in here important oversight, transparency, accountability provisions to protect the American people. And time is of the essence. But at some point and some time, we have to have the political will and the courage to start paying for  things again in this country so we do not leave a legacy of debt for our children and grandchildren. We won't accomplish that today, but time is of the essence and we must move this rescue plan forward to avert a much wider disaster tomorrow.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if we had approved the legislation on Monday, we would not have been able to pass the tax extenders package, which includes business and energy tax extenders. The AMT patch, we all worked hard on that across the aisle, whether you wanted to pay for it or not was the debate, and the additional disaster assistance as well as mental health parity. I think these are important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alexander Hamilton, my idol, was very clear that there are immutable principles of moral obligation. Monday I voted "no," and I know that the enemy of the good is the perfect. But since Monday we have improved certain parts of the bill. And there is some junk in this bill. There are no two ways about it. But that is not unique on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to help the American people, I am now supporting today's financial package. And it's really the McCrery-Rangel team that got me to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You guys have worked closely together. You are a good model and example for what we should be doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pray that I'm doing the right thing. I believe so in my heart. God bless this country. We will prevail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the legislation we have before us today arises at a vital time when Americans are suffering under a rapidly failing financial market and collapsing housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My "no" vote on Monday was among one of the most difficult votes I have had to cast in my 12 years as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My goal in Congress has always been to fight for the best interest of ordinary Americans--to fight for the American worker, the American small business owner, the people who make up the heart and soul of our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought of them when I voted "no" on Monday because that bill fell short of helping those people who are suffering the most from this financial crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I stand before you far from assured that this legislation is a s good as it can be but understanding that we cannot stand back and allow our financial markets, credit markets, housing market, pension plans, and small businesses to collapse under the weight of the errors made by Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lead by Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank we have taken an inadequate 2 1/2  page proposal and developed a more substantial bipartisan piece of legislation which we present today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the addition of the increase to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC. It is exactly the type of bottomup, community approach we need to put liquidity back in to Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, if we had approved the bill on Monday we would not have been able to pass this tax extenders package that includes business and energy tax extenders, an AMT patch, additional disaster assistance as well as mental health parity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am certainly disappointed that these provisions are not paid for but it would be unconscionable to allow the American people to suffer without this tax relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill is not perfect but we have done what we needed to do for the American people. In truth if you gave every Member of Congress a chance to draft a proposal to address this crisis we would have 435 bills in front of us today--the enemy of the good is the perfect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Monday we have improved this bill to help the American people and therefore I am supporting today's financial rescue package. I urge all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to vote "yes" on Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>But what they have done to the bill is they have added special tax breaks for those who import bows and arrows, and those who import wool, thus displacing American products as part of the economic recovery package. That's why it's not the economic recovery package. It's the pork-laden, earmark-laden Wall Street bailout bill. It is a bill that will send hundreds of billions of dollars not for bad investment decisions made in America but to buy toxic assets currently in the safes in London and  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Beijing. It is a bill that will allow million-dollar-a-month salaries, and $5 million-a-month salaries, to be paid to executives who have driven their firms into the ground and now need a taxpayer bailout.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have limited time here, and I want to explain to the Members that I will be devoting most of my time to colloquy with Members who have serious concerns about this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this bill has a great deal more in it in a number of areas, including in particular avoiding foreclosures, than people have recognized. I at this point will insert into the Record under General Leave a letter from the American Banker, in which Sheila Bair, who is one of the best regulators we have ever had, who has been using her authority over the mortgages she inherited through the IndyMac failure to really provide foreclosure relief, and she says in this: "The provision  would allow the Treasury Department to provide credit guarantees and enhancements on whole loans." Ms. Bair said in an interview Thursday, "They can have so much bigger bang for their buck." She asked us to put this in. We put it in. It may be obscure, but it in and of itself will lead to a great deal of help for people with mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I will be doing, Madam Speaker, during this debate is yielding time for colloquies to Members who are seeking clarification of points in the bill, many of them involving what is very powerful language, although not everything we would have liked, to mitigate foreclosures. I will say that I have spoken to the people at the Department of Treasury, including yesterday morning the Secretary himself, and I will be making commitments today about how we believe this bill will be interpreted, and  I will be making no commitments that I have not explained to the Treasury, that the staff of the Financial Services Committee which has done such wonderful work has not discussed with the Treasury. So we will be, as I said, working with Members to clarify some parts of this bill because I do not think it is fully appreciated that it has a good deal more in it for the foreclosure issue and some other issues than has been recognized.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Bair: How to Get More Bang for Bailout Buck</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Rob Blackwell)</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington.--Of all the provisions in the bill designed to stabilize the financial markets, one of its most potent is not getting enough attention, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would allow the Treasury Department to provide credit guarantees and enhancements on whole loans. If it were used, it would allow the government to increase modifications and stabilize home prices at a much smaller cost than buying the loans themselves, Ms. Bair said in an interview Thursday.</narrative>
  <narrative>"They can have so much bigger bang for their buck," she said. "You don't have an initial cash outlay, you can leave them in the private sector, you can do the servicing in the private sector, and you can condition them on some type of modification protocol, which would get the mortgages restructured faster."</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision, a single sentence in the 451-page bill, has attracted little attention from analysts and industry representatives. Instead, they have focused on the crux of the bill, which would allow the Treasury to buy and hold up to $700 billion of troubled assets.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill would give the Treasury secretary the power to "use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures."</narrative>
  <narrative>How that would work remains unclear. In theory, the Treasury could guarantee certain types of loans--option adjustable-rate mortgages, for example--and require lenders that want to use the insurance to engage in loan modifications first. If the reworked loan performed, the government would never be involved, but if the loan later defaulted, the government would take a certain amount of the loss.</narrative>
  <narrative>Though she is supportive of the $700 billion buyout facility, Ms. Bair said the provision, added at the behest of the FDIC, could provide a critical alternative.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It will be another tool they have in their toolkit, and it will be cheaper," she said. "You can provide credit support to $100 billion worth of mortgages with no up-front cash outlay. The exposure would be less than buying those mortgages directly."</narrative>
  <narrative>During her two-year tenure, the FDIC has moved from the background to the forefront of the housing crisis. In the past week alone it has handled the largest failure of all time--the $309 billion-asset Washington Mutual Inc.--with no cost to the government. It also invoked the systemic risk exception for the first time in the agency's history to facilitate a deal to sell most of Wachovia Corp. to Citigroup Inc.</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. Bair said regulators had no choice but to use the exception, which was created in 1991 and required the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We all felt that preventive action was needed," she said. "It was a potential failure, driven primarily by market confidence issues."</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. Bair has also been working to help pass the bailout bill. After the House unexpectedly defeated the legislation Monday, lawmakers scrambled for provisions to bring more Republicans on board. The most  notable addition would increase deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor per institution.</narrative>
  <narrative>That provision would reassure nervous depositors that the banking system is stable, Ms. Bair said, and it gets to the heart of the problem: a lack of confidence among consumers, bankers, and businesses.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Raising the deposit insurance limit to $250,000 is designed to address that problem  of public confidence," she said. "Expanding that safety net for a period of time, I think, will help with the Main Street depositor and also provide help for banks."</narrative>
  <narrative>The coverage hike would take effect immediately and would expire Dec. 31, 2009. The bill explicitly says banks should not face a premium hike as a result. Analysts argue that Congress would have to make the higher limit permanent. Ms. Bair would not take a position, except to say the FDIC should have the power to raise premiums if the increase becomes permanent.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's a question for Congress," she said. "It could be destabilizing if they lift it in 2009, but the trade-off would be that banks would have to start paying premiums."</narrative>
  <narrative>Overall, she said, she hopes the legislation will help ease fears among financial institutions, some of which have become worried about lending to each other.</narrative>
  <narrative>"There is a confidence issue," Ms. Bair said. "Originally, liquidity issues were tied to capital adequacy. Now I think liquidity issues are tied to just uncertainty. ..... We are asking Main Street to have confidence in the banking system. Well, I would ask the banks to have confidence in the banking system and lend to each other."</narrative>
  <narrative>She said a freeze on credit is only making the situation worse.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We acknowledge that some individual banks have challenges, but overall they still have strong capital, and they've built up their loan loss reserves," she said. "We shouldn't be freezing up and panicking."</narrative>
  <narrative>Though some have argued the bailout bill does not go to the heart of the issue, Ms. Bair was unequivocal in saying she thought the buyout facility would help the situation.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The reason for the liquidity issue is you have an asset on the balance sheet where the cash flow suggests one valuation, but if you have to sell it, you will be taking a steep loss because the market is seizing up," she said. "So we will be providing a vehicle for moving those assets off balance sheet for a price other than a rock-bottom distressed price. We are capable of letting the government hold the asset for a while before it's sold which will help ease downward pressure on asset valuations.  It absolutely should help."</narrative>
  <narrative>But she acknowledged some concern that the legislation did not do enough to help struggling borrowers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. Bair was at the forefront last year in warning that lenders and servicers needed to systematically lock in low, starter rates so that borrowers could continue making their mortgage payments on time. More defaults would lead to increased foreclosures, which would cause further deterioration in the housing market. Few took her advice, and the housing market continued to sink.</narrative>
  <narrative>If more lenders had modified loans, she said the situation would still be bad, but not as dramatic.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We were going to have these problems no matter what, but I do think it would be less of an impact," she said.</narrative>
  <narrative>But Ms. Bair said she did not understand why Congress is not doing more to assist borrowers in the bailout legislation. Lawmakers debated forcing more servicers to engage in systematic modifications, but ultimately did not do so.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I don't understand it," she said. "The borrowers here that are losing their houses have been this politically powerless group. From the get go, politically, for whatever reason, they were put in a category of they got over their head and were an unsympathetic group to deal with. That is not the case with all of them."</narrative>

  <narrative>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We were profoundly disappointed with the House vote on Monday rejecting bipartisan economic recovery legislation. We are writing today to urge the House to act now to pass the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act to bring stability to credit markets.</narrative>
  <narrative>The impact of the House action was painfully demonstrated Monday when the stock market lost $1.2 trillion as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 777.8 points, the largest single-day point drop in American history. Virtually every American witnessed their retirement, investment and savings accounts decline steeply.</narrative>
  <narrative>Further, the evaporation of credit is affecting businesses of all sizes and consumers and we run the risk of further declines in housing values. If Congress fails to act, credit markets will tighten further. Our associations' members will find it more difficult--if not impossible--to secure credit to finance their operations, and members' employees will find it harder to get mortgages, secure auto loans, and borrow money to send their children to college.</narrative>
  <narrative>Americans rely on credit and liquid markets to make our economy function, and we will continue to see our economy and the well-being of all Americans impacted unless the House acts. Significant bipartisan cooperation has produced a strong financial rescue plan with strong taxpayer protections to help stabilize the financial system and prevent a meltdown of our capital markets.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Senate has passed this legislation by a 3 to 1 margin. We urge you to address this crisis by voting to support this critically-needed measure.</narrative>

  <narrative>Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno said the city has been waiting a long time to repair sidewalks and tear down abandoned buildings in his financially beleaguered city. Now residents will have to wait a little longer.</narrative>
  <narrative>With the crisis on Wall Street, the first-term mayor's promises to pay for improvements on Springfield's streets are on hold because raising money by floating municipal bonds in this climate is prohibitively expensive, he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is the kind of problem facing dozens of communities, say officials. Like a hurricane swirling offshore, the financial crisis is barreling down on Massachusetts cities and towns, but no one knows yet how bad the damage could be.</narrative>
  <narrative>Local leaders this week have been nervously eyeing bailout negotiations on Capitol Hill, the freezing bond markets, their falling pension fund values, and the State House, where Governor Deval Patrick may eventually decide to seek local aid cuts.</narrative>
  <narrative>The moribund credit markets are making it difficult to pay for capital projects such as road work, because credit is either unavailable or rates are too high, local officials and municipal finance observers say. "I'm trying to be fiscally prudent while at the same time trying to drive an ambitious agenda," Sarno said. "It does affect Main Street, whether people are calling for a pothole or a multimillion dollar project they want improved."</narrative>
  <narrative>Boston has so far not been affected because it usually issues general-obligation bonds in February or March, said the city's chief financial officer, Lisa Signori. But other cities and towns were looking to enter the bond market sooner.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Communities that have been planning on issuing debt for a large municipal project--a police station, a school, infrastructure improvements--are likely monitoring the situation and waiting to issue debt, waiting for the market to stabilize and for banks to issue credit again," said Geoff Beckwith, executive director of the. Massachusetts Municipal Association.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sarno said Springfield has a wish list of capital improvements totalling $470 million, with $23 million on a high-priority list. Projects that could be affected range from sidewalk repairs and planned demolitions of derelict buildings costing tens of thousands of dollars to a major renewal for Springfield's South End estimated to cost $6.2 million.</narrative>
  <narrative>Quincy Mayor Thomas P. Koch said funding for ongoing construction of a new Quincy High School and other projects, including a planned new middle school, could be affected.</narrative>
  <narrative>"You don't put the bond out at once. You borrow periodically and then float the bond," he said. 'We're working with the state on an application to replace the middle school and we're going to market soon with  the bonds for that. Some of the other improvements at other buildings may just have to wait a little bit."</narrative>
  <narrative>Officials at the Massachusetts School Building Authority, which has committed to help dozens of communities build schools, have sought to assuage concerns.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The MSBA's financial obligations to school construction projects will be met despite the current economic turmoil," the authority said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Carrie Sullivan on Wednesday.</narrative>
  <narrative>Municipal pension funds, which are invested in a vast array of stocks, bonds, and other securities, are another significant source of worry.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Clearly this is not good news and is not a good market and there will be some loss of value that will appear on the books," Beckwith said. "The question is, will that value be recovered before the pension system needs to access those assets."</narrative>
  <narrative>Signori said Boston's pension board would be briefed by financial advisers next week on the state of the city's investments. "Certainly, this quarter's performance is important, but what you're looking at is what's happening over five years or over ten years," she said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Other Boston city accounts and investments are considered secure because the city collateralized them in the late 1990s, meaning the investments are backed up by cash from other banks and not subject to ceilings on federal deposit insurance.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We weren't out there to make a lot on high interest rates; we wanted to make sure our money was safe," Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said this week. "The city of Boston's money is safe."</narrative>
  <narrative>But Menino and Signori acknowledged the city's finances could be hurt if revenue from motor vehicle excise tax and hotel-motel excise taxes are down and if local aid takes a hit. Projected local aid for Boston already had fallen $60 million from 2002, Signori said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Quincy Mayor Koch said he was worried the city's retirement board could seek more city funding if its investments are hurt.</narrative>
  <narrative>"If the retirement board does not get back the returns they anticipate, that means they're going to be asking for more appropriation level on the operations side," Koch said in a phone interview. "That bears watching, big-time."</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 129 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is intended to formalize the reporting procedures of the Federal Reserve Board to its oversight committees in the House and Senate when it exercises authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, relating to loans made to individuals, partnerships and corporations under unusual and exigent circumstances.</narrative>
  <narrative>Paragraph (a) of Section 129 directs the Federal Reserve to report to its oversight committees in the House and Senate within 7 days after it has exercised authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. To facilitate congressional oversight, the Federal Reserve would provide the appropriate congressional committees justification for its actions under Section 13(3) and explain the specific terms of the actions taken by the Board, including providing information about the size and duration  of any lending, available information concerning any collateral held with respect to such lending, the recipient of warrants or other potential equity in exchange for such lending, and any expected cost to the taxpayer related to the Board's action.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Federal Reserve has used its 13(3) powers to extend loans to borrowers in specific one-off transactions as well as to offer several facilities that are open to a range of borrowers on the same terms. Paragraph (b) of Section 129 provides for periodic updates by the Federal Reserve to its congressional oversight committees and is intended to apply to any loan or facility initiated under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including the status of the loan or facility, the aggregate value  of the collateral held in connection with the loan or facility, and the projected cost to the taxpayers of the loan or facility.</narrative>
  <narrative>Paragraph (c) of Section 129 provides for the confidentiality of any reports made under the section and is intended to make all such reports confidential upon the request of the Federal Reserve Board. Paragraph (d) makes the reporting requirement under the section retroactive to March 1, 2008.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we come here today in the midst of the biggest economic crisis this Nation has ever faced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal that was put forth by the administration earlier was unacceptable, no accountability, no government oversight, too much burden on the American taxpayer. But politics is the art of the possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House is a place where policy and reality come together, where people solve problems. I was sitting right there when the vote was taken Monday. As soon as it went down, I turned to my colleagues and said, It's time to roll up our sleeves, it's time to solve this problem for America, and let's move forward. And we did that. I was on the phone with Treasury, with the administration, with Senate and House leadership, with the SEC. We've got suspension of mark to market. We've got increased  FDIC insurance. We've got tax relief, AMT, child tax credit. This is a better bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it's tough out there. I've talked to my moms, I've talked to my pops, I've talked to my corporations. No matter what we do or what we pass, there are still tough times out there. People are hurting. People are mad. I'm mad. Men and women that have fought in this House, I have fought in this House for spending regulations and tougher restraint, and we have seen what has happened and where it has led us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do I still have concerns about this bill? Yes. Do I still have concerns that it will affect the free market system? Yes, I do. But we have to act and we have to act now. It's our job to lead. If we don't solve these problems, not just these problems but Medicare and Social Security, if this House doesn't lead, America will fail. And if we don't get anything out of this conversation today, we need to understand that. It's about leadership. It's about moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've had experts on both sides say, Gresham, this is a good thing, this is a bad thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I asked the good Lord to give me the guidance and the wisdom to make the decision. I will vote "yes," and I ask my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) for the purpose of a colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I won't take that much time. I do want to thank the chairman for his masterful leadership on this bill, and I do want to clarify that the intent of this legislation is to authorize the Treasury Department to strengthen credit markets by infusing capital into weak institutions in two ways: By buying their stock, debt, or other capital instruments; and, two, by purchasing bad assets from the institutions, in coordination with existing regulatory  agencies and their responsibilities under this legislation, as well as under already existing authorization for prompt, corrective action and least-cost resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'd be happy to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I can affirm that. As the gentleman knows, the Treasury Department is in agreement with this, and we should be clear, this is one of the things that this House and the Senate added to the bill, the authority to buy equity. It is not simply buying up the assets, it is to buy equity, and to buy equity in a way that the Federal Government will able to benefit if there is an appreciation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for this important clarification. He is absolutely right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In implementing the powers provided for in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, it is the intent of Congress that Treasury should use Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) resources to fund capital infusion and asset purchase approaches alone or in conjunction with each other to enable financial institutions to begin providing credit again, and to do so in ways that minimize the burden on taxpayers and have maximum economic recovery impact. Where the legislation speaks of "assets",  that term is intended to include capital instruments of an institution such as common and preferred stock, subordinated and senior debt, and equity rights. Also, it is the intent of this legislation that TARP resources should be used in coordination with regulatory agencies and their responsibilities under prompt-corrective-action and least-cost resolution statutes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, everybody in this Chamber knows the right political vote on this package. The easy thing to do is vote "no" and hope the bill passes. Every Member knows there is no political upside to supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's also easy to say that something must be done--but something else. Well, we all have our own preferred  plans, Madam Speaker. The only problem is none of them get 218 votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are struggling to do the right thing. Lyndon Johnson used to say, "Doing the right thing isn't hard; knowing the right thing to do is." This is certainly one of those occasions, Madam Speaker. But I am convinced unless we act, the stock market will take a nose dive, economic activity will freeze, credit markets will dry up, people will lose their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real question is: Are we willing to gamble the jobs, the life savings, the retirement accounts, the homes and the businesses of the people we represent? Are we willing to risk the global, political, and social turmoil that will come if we have a prolonged recession or depression in the United States? Frankly, Madam Speaker, I am not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, everyone in this room knows the right "political" vote on this package. The easy thing to do is to vote no and hope the bill passes. Every member knows there is no political upside in supporting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also easy to say, "something must be done--but not this." We all have our own schemes. Certainly I have my own five-point "Tom Cole plan." I would suspend mark-to-market accounting rules, purchase preferred stock in institutions to protect the taxpayer, institute a private insurance program, limit executive compensation in companies that get Federal help, and raise the FDIC insured bank deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. There is only one problem with my plan, Madam Speaker, it cannot  get 218 votes in this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I know that my colleagues on both sides of this issue want to do "the right thing." However, as Lyndon Johnson used to say, "doing the right thing isn't hard, knowing the right thing to do is." I have struggled over whether passing this bill is the right thing to do. I do know that if it fails the stock market will take a nose dive, credit will freeze up and economic activity will grind to a halt. Some believe in time the markets will stabilize and correct themselves. I hope  they are right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real question is are we willing to gamble the jobs, life savings, retirement accounts, the homes and the businesses of the people we represent? And are we willing to risk the global political and social turmoil that will surely occur if there is a severe and prolonged recession or depression in the United States? Frankly, Madam Speaker, I am not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am from Oklahoma, a state that has had more than its share of economic hardship over the years. My grandparents and parents lived through the Great Depression. They dealt with the hard times at home and the wars abroad that it spawned. My family and I lived through the 1980s when a banking and real estate collapse devastated Oklahoma's economy. I saw my State's per capita income fall from 98 percent to 79 percent of the national average. I saw hundreds of banks close, thousands  of businesses fail, and countless families lose their life's savings. I do not intend to let that happen again for the sake of political popularity, ideological purity, or legislative perfection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, passing this bill is no substitute for long to structural reforms, appropriate legislative oversight, and the establishment of suitable levels of accountability and transparency in our financial markets. Those are issues we must confront in the next Congress. However, inaction in the face of the current turmoil in the markets is not an acceptable option. In fact, it is a huge gamble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I know I will be haunted by this vote for the rest of my political life. I know I will have to explain it again and again to my friends. And I will be forced to defend it in every election against my opponents. And I know, having made this vote, I will have to make other tough votes to reform our economic and political systems. However that is far better than the lost jobs, the foreclosed homes, the depleted savings, the broken businesses, the devastated lives, and the dangerous  world that I believe will be the consequences of a failure to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill not because I wish to, but because I have to for the good of the people I represent. I trust that each of my colleagues will cast their vote in the same spirit, and I truly believe they will. There are no good choices here--but positive action is the right choice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to one of our leading attorneys in the House, who, representing the State of California, has a particular knowledge about much of what we are trying to do in this bill in the foreclosure area, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there's much not to like in this bill and there's a lot to be angry about how we got here, and if this passes, our job will not be done. We will have further efforts that will be required, especially to stabilize the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I chair the California Democratic Delegation. I want to share with Members the communications we have received from California's Governor and the Treasurer of the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Governor tells us, and this is a quote, "It is daunting that California, the eighth largest economy in the world, cannot obtain financing in the normal course of its business to bridge our annual lag between expenditures and revenues. This means that California may soon be forced to delay payments for critical services, such as teachers, law enforcement, and nursing homes. The same thing would happen to California cities and counties."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Treasurer, Bill Lockyer, has told us, "For 10 days, State and local governments have been closed out of credit markets--long-term and short-term--in spite of the fact they represent no default risk and provide a good tax return to investors." He says, "Without prompt Federal action to address the economic crisis, we may have no market access. That means the State's cash reserves will be exhausted near the end of October. Payments for teachers' salaries, nursing homes, law enforcement,  and every other State-funded service would stop or be significantly delayed. California's 5,000 cities, counties, school districts, and special districts would face the same fate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a $7 billion revenue anticipation note that the State needs to float to meet cash flow needs, and they cannot sell those revenue anticipation notes because of the credit freeze.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Folks, what this means is that the State of California, the eighth largest economy in the world, will not be able to meet payroll by the end of this month unless we take action to unfreeze these credit markets. I wanted to make sure that every Californian and, really, every American knew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STATE CAPITOL,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sacramento, CA, October 2, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. Secretary, First of all, let me commend you for your leadership to enact emergency economic stabilization legislation. This credit crisis has the power to grind the U.S. economy to a halt if swift and decisive action is not taken immediately. The federal rescue package is not a bailout of Wall Street tycoons--it is a lifeboat for millions of Americans whose life savings, businesses, retirement plans and jobs are at stake. I have communicated this message to the entire California  Congressional delegation and will continue to press for passage of an emergency rescue plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many other states, California is feeling the enormous effects of this crisis on our economy. California's economy is dynamic and resilient, but also uniquely sensitive to national and international economic conditions and fluctuations in the financial markets. The credit crisis has frozen investment and commerce, forcing businesses and families to stop purchasing goods and services. This has resulted in tens of thousands of lost jobs and billions of dollars in lost tax revenue to the state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most immediately, California and a number of other state and local governments are experiencing the lack of liquidity in the credit markets firsthand. Many states and local governments have been unable to secure financing for bond offerings and for routine cash flow used to make critical payments to schools, local governments and law enforcement. While some states may be able to absorb a delay or obtain high-interest financing through private banks, California is so large that our short-term  cash flow needs exceed the entire budget of some states. We expect to issue $7 billion in Revenue Anticipation Notes for short term cash flow purposes in a matter of days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Absent a clear resolution to this financial crisis that restores confidence and liquidity to the credit markets, California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the Federal Treasury for short-term financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economic fallout from this national credit crisis continues to drain state tax coffers, making it even more difficult to weather the continuation of frozen credit markets for any length of time. I will continue to do all I can to encourage passage of the emergency rescue plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arnold Schwarzenegger,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STATE CAPITOL,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sacramento, CA, October 1, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Members of the California Congressional Delegation, it's now very clear that the financial crisis on Wall Street is affecting California--its businesses, its citizens' daily lives and its state government's  ability to obtain financing to pay for critical services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is how serious the situation is: our State Treasurer warns that the credit market has already frozen up to the point that it chills even the State of California's ability to meet its short-term cash flow needs. Additionally, without immediate action from you and your colleagues in Congress, California will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for the highway, school, housing and water construction projects that our state is relying on to help carry us through this difficult economy. The  state of our already-slow economy makes the financial situation even more urgent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is daunting that California, the eighth-largest economy in the world, cannot obtain financing in the normal course of its business to bridge our annual lag between expenditures and revenues. This means California may soon be forced to delay payments for critical services, such as teachers, law enforcement and nursing homes. The same thing would happen to California's counties and cities. That is, unless Congress acts quickly to restore confidence in our financial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am writing to urge you to vote in favor of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. This plan is critical to the well-being of every community in California and across the nation. Swift action in Congress is needed to restore confidence in our financial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear, this plan is not a "bailout" for Wall Street. To the contrary, the plan is about protecting Main Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are currently witnessing the initial consequences of depositors and investors withdrawing assets from a financial system in which they have lost confidence and putting them in FDIC-insured accounts and federal obligations. That means there's little money for normal commerce, and what money is available is too costly. This dramatically reduces economic activity, translating into fewer jobs, lower wages, reduced savings and threatened pensions. If the stabilization plan fails, these outcomes  will materialize in scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California's businesses, both large and small, also face the prospect that banks will not be able to renew loans. It goes without saying that, when people and companies can't get the money to buy cars, inventory goods, plant crops, expand business and go to school, economic activity slows down, leading to job losses, wage reductions, savings declines and pension failures all along Main Street, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation is urgent. The crisis we face demands swift action and bipartisan leadership. Congress must pass this economic stability plan without further delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arnold Schwarzenegger,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[From the California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer, October 1, 2008]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treasurer Lockyer Urges Congress To Adopt Economic Recovery Plan To Thaw Market for Infrastructure Bonds, Cash-Flow Borrowing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sacramento.--State Treasurer Bill Lockyer today warned that a continuing failure by Congress to adopt a national economic recovery plan jeopardizes California's ability to sell infrastructure bonds and short-term notes to meet the State's cash flow needs. In releasing the 2008 State of California Debt Affordability Report, Lockyer made the following statement:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"For 10 days, state and local governments have been closed out of credit markets--long-term and short-term--in spite of the fact that they represent no default risk and provide a good tax-free return to investors. The credit market is frozen because financial institutions are afraid to commit capital amid enormous uncertainty. Congress and the President need to adopt a responsible recovery plan, and get the job done quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The State and local issuers need certainty that thaws credit markets and eases access to crucial financing. Without action, we will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for highway construction, schools, housing or water projects. More urgently, because the State budget was so late, we have only four short weeks to complete what otherwise would be a routine revenue anticipation note sale to meet the State's cash flow needs. Without prompt federal action to address the economic crisis, we  may have no market access to conduct that short-term borrowing transaction. That means the State's cash reserves would be exhausted near the end of October. Payments for teachers' salaries, nursing homes, law enforcement and every other State-funded service would stop or be significantly delayed. And California's 5,000 cities, counties, school districts and special districts would face the same fate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2008 Debt Affordability Report recounts the year's turmoil in capital markets, how it affected the State, and how the State responded to protect taxpayers. The report also details the Lockyer-led effort to end rating agencies' discriminatory treatment of municipal bond issuers. The current system harms taxpayers and misleads investors. The report is available at www.treasurer.ca.gov.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we all understand that without action many of our citizens will find themselves laid off from their jobs. They won't be able to refinance their homes. This crisis is real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House conservatives know that inaction is not an option, and we have worked tirelessly to put different plans, ideas, and legislation on the table to remedy the crisis. We take some measure of pride in knowing that the underlying legislation has now been improved twice. We believe our efforts help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Madam Speaker, I still have many fears about the legislation before us. No one knows if this plan will truly work. We all hope it does. No one knows the true mount of taxpayer liability. The Secretary of the Treasury can go through $700 billion in no time flat and come right back to Congress for $700 billion more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fear that this legislation still remains more of a bailout than a workout. I fear that it undermines the ethic of personal responsibility. I fear that it still rewards bad behavior and punishes good. But my greatest fear, Madam Speaker, is that it fundamentally changes the role of the government in our free enterprise economy and, despite its current problems, this economy remains the envy of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down? If we lose our ability to fail, will we not soon lose our ability to succeed? If Congress bails out some firms and sectors, how can it say no to others?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must be very careful as we address this financial crisis that we ensure that any short-term gain does not come at the expense of even longer term pain, that being the slippery slope to socialism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the thought of my children growing up in an America with less freedom, less opportunity, and a lower standard of living is a long-term pain I cannot and will not bear. Therefore, I will vote again "no" on this legislation. I vote "no" with some doubt. But, Madam Speaker, there is a better way.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I sit here listening to this, I realize that those watching must be very confused. It's a very difficult subject. It's very difficult to figure out what the right thing to do is. As far is I can tell, it's quite clear what the right thing to do is, and that is pass this bill, with all its imperfections, to address an underlying problem with our credit markets, which will have damaging long-term effects on our real economy, on jobs, on savings, on the  dreams of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what Americans need to understand is that we are going to get through this. With all the argument, the fussing, the fighting, we are going to get through this. This country is going to be a better country 5 years from now, 10 years from now, than it is today. It should be proud. It should keep its head up. It should be confident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of those who are in the lending industry, the banking industry, should be confident in the future of America, and comfortable with the idea that we need to just get back on track quickly for the sake of all Americans so that we can be the strong country that America deserves to be in the future.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Monday it was with reluctance that I voted to oppose the earlier version of this bill. I did so not because I believed there was no urgent need to act. On the contrary, I believed we had to act quickly, but we had to do it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've fought hard to present alternatives and add taxpayer protections. Working with some great colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we offered options that ranged from insuring instead of buying mortgage-backed securities, to tightening the language on possible losses to the Treasury, to injecting capital through tax cuts for repatriation of foreign earnings and more. Working with Mr. LaTourette, we even attempted to limit the initial outlay to $250 billion so that Congress  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H10766]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last few days, we've made more progress. The FDIC is raising its insurance limit to protect people's savings. The SEC is revising its mark-to-market accounting guidelines, and we have included middle class tax relief. But there still are many changes I would like to see. Unfortunately, the volatility in the market is threatening the financial security of my constituents and millions of American families, small businesses, and retirees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake: the latest compromise is not the best package. It's the package that can move through Congress in time to protect the economy from lasting damage. With the clock ticking, credit markets seizing up, and the market swinging wildly, it is clear that the time for seeking better options has run out. I'm glad we held out for the taxpayer protections that we got. But if we don't act now, those who are least to blame for this mess will suffer the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is with reluctance that I support this bill today and urge my colleagues to do the same. Our work is by no means complete. I look forward to revisiting the issue as Congress monitors the program to ensure that we minimize risks and that the taxpayers see a return on this investment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield for a unanimous consent request to a gentleman from Ohio who has been very seriously engaged on this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The public is being led to believe that Congress has reconsidered its position because we have before us a better bill than we had a few days ago. It is the same bill plus hundreds of new pages for hundreds of millions of tax breaks. What does this have to do with the troubles of Wall Street?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Driven by fear we are moving quickly to pass a bill, which may produce a temporary uptick for the market but nothing for millions of homeowners whose misfortunes are at the center of our economic woes. People do not have money to pay their mortgages. After this passes, they will still not have money to pay their mortgages. People will still lose their homes while Wall Street is bailed out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The central flaw of this bill is that there are no stronger protections for homeowners and no changes in the language to ensure that the secretary has the authority to compel mortgage servicers to modify the terms of mortgages. And there are no stronger regulatory changes to fix the circumstances that allowed this to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should have created a mechanism for our Government to take a controlling interest in mortgage-backed securities and use our power to work out a new deal for the homeowners. We could have done this. We should have done this. But we didn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now millions of Americans will face the threat of foreclosure without any help. And the numbers will soon rise for a number of reasons. Not only because of the Alt-A, jumbo mortgages which will soon be reset at higher interest rates, but because the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is pushing up rates on adjustable mortgages and more than half of the U.S. adjustable mortgage rates are tied to LIBOR. Homeowner defaults will grow in significant numbers. Let's see if Congress will be as quick  to help homeowners on Main Street as they were to help speculators on Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Government will have to borrow $700 billion from banks, with interest, to give banks a $700 billion bailout, and in return the taxpayers get $700 billion in toxic debt. The Senate "improved" the bailout by giving tax breaks to people in foreclosure. People in foreclosure need help paying their mortgage, they do not seek tax breaks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across our Nation, foreclosures continue to devastate our communities, people are losing their jobs, and the prices of necessities are skyrocketing. This legislation, just like the one we defeated last week, will do nothing to solve the problems plaguing American families or help them to get out from underneath the oppressive debt they have been forced to take on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there has been no discussion of the underlying debt-based economy and the role of our monetary system in facilitating the redistribution of wealth upwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not as though we had no choice but to pass the bill before us. We could have done this differently. We could have demanded language in the legislation that would have empowered the Treasury to compel mortgage servicers to rework the terms of mortgage loans so homeowners could avoid foreclosure. We could have put regulatory structures in place to protect investors. We could have stopped the speculators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill represents an utter failure of the democratic process. It represents the triumph of special interest over the triumph of the public interest. It represents the inability of Government to defend the public interest in the face of great pressure from financial interests. We could have recognized the power of Government to prime the pump of the economy to get money flowing through out society by creating jobs, health care, and major investments in green energy. What a lost opportunity!  What a moment of transition away from democracy and towards domination of America by global economic interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years ago, in a Cleveland neighborhood, I saw a hand-scrawled sign above a cash register in a delicatessen. The sign said: "In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash." The sign above the Speaker's rostrum reads "In God We Trust," but today we are paying the cash to Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not as if we had no other choice but to pass this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Foreclosure Victim, 90, Apparently Shoots Self</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Phil Trexler)</narrative>
  <narrative>At the age of 90, Addie Polk found herself in foreclosure this week, about to be forced from the home she's lived in for nearly 40 years.</narrative>
  <narrative>So, with a gun in her hand, the Akron widow apparently shot herself in the chest Wednesday afternoon as deputies were knocking on her door with eviction papers in hand.</narrative>
  <narrative>While a nation reels in financial crisis from years of mortgage abuse, Polk is recovering at Akron General Medical Center, awaiting word on where she will live when she's released.</narrative>
  <narrative>Meanwhile, city leaders say Polk has become Akron's "poster child" for victims of predatory lenders.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I think this is a case where we need to step in and help this lady if she is so desperate to shoot herself because she can't pay her mortgage," Akron Councilman Marco Sommerville said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Court records show Polk took out a 30-year, 6.375 percent mortgage just four years ago for $45,620 with a Countrywide Home Loan office in Cuyahoga Falls. She took out a line of credit that same day for $11,380.</narrative>
  <narrative>Her La Croix Avenue home was appraised by Summit County in 2004 at $31,230.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Countrywide branch did not return a call for comment Thursday.</narrative>
  <narrative>Polk essentially owed the same $45,000 when the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) filed for foreclosure on her home in 2007. Fannie Mae assumed the mortgage from Countrywide.</narrative>
  <narrative>Following foreclosure this year, Polk's six-room, 101-year-old home was bought by Fannie Mae at sheriffs auction for $28,000.</narrative>
  <narrative>Her house now belongs to the lender.</narrative>
  <narrative>Summit County sheriffs deputies say Polk ignored multiple notes and letters leading up to Wednesday's eviction. She also ignored the foreclosure action filed in court.</narrative>
  <narrative>It wasn't until Tuesday that she called the sheriffs office in disbelief. The next day was eviction day.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I'm positive she believed the deputies were going to come in, clean out the house and set her and her things on the curb, because they did that decades ago. But that's not what happens nowadays," sheriffs Lt. Kandy Fatheree said.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I'm sure she had to be thinking back to the Great Depression when people were set out on the street. She had to be scared to death."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deputies Dave Bailey, Jason Beam and Don Fatheree went to the home about 1 p.m. Wednesday to meet with a Fannie Mae representative and escort Polk from the house. They said they had no idea the woman was 90 years old.</narrative>
  <narrative>The deputies' knocks were unanswered, and they were about to leave because the Fannie Mae representative failed to show. Then, they heard a banging noise coming from the home's second floor.</narrative>
  <narrative>Next-door neighbor Robert Dillon heard it, too. More bangs followed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dillon borrowed a neighbor's ladder and climbed through Polk's second-floor bathroom window and walked into her bedroom. She was lying on her side, a gun next to her on the bed.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I'm thinking to myself, `Why does Mrs. Polk got a gun?' " Dillon said. "After looking around, I touched her shoulder and saw the blood and I said, `Shucks, she done shot herself.' "</narrative>
  <narrative>Dillon, 62, shouted to the deputies, who alerted Akron EMS. Polk apparently shot herself more than once with a small-caliber handgun, police said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Polk and her late husband, Robert, a Goodrich retiree, moved into the home in 1970. He died in 1995, but Polk continued to live independently, but alone, still driving her late model Chevrolet to the grocery store and church.</narrative>
  <narrative>She appeared to be struggling financially, Dillon said, but he said she never spoke of the foreclosure action looming for more than a year.</narrative>
  <narrative>She had no children of her own and few visitors, he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>"She didn't need no help. She got around good," he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is unclear how Polk used the loan money. Dillon said he didn't notice any work being done on the property, and deputies said her front porch was soft from years of neglect.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Where'd the money go?" Dillon asked.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sommerville said he is working with the city and the county to assist Polk with housing, once she is released from the hospital.</narrative>
  <narrative>He said the city has been awarded more than $8 million in federal grants in the wake of the mortgage crisis to help cope with the crush.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sommerville said Polk's fate humanizes the problem for the rich and poor. And he urged those facing foreclosure to seek assistance through various local and county agencies.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's a sad situation," he said. "She's the poster child for this foreclosure crisis we are facing."</narrative>

    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to a member of the Committee on Financial Services, who has been very much concerned with the question of foreclosure, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me first say, Chairman Frank, how much we all appreciate the outstanding job you have been doing on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank, it's very important that as we consider this financial package, we make sure we do everything we possibly can to reduce the number of foreclosures and keep families in their homes. We are losing 6,300 foreclosures every single day. In this regard, I have been working on, and I presented to you a four-point package to reach this goal. At this time, I certainly want to thank my collaborator, Dr. James Galbraith from the University of Texas, for his advice on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially, what we want to do is really, quite honestly, in the spirit of our great Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, for I believe we need to give the Treasury Secretary efficient tools so that he will be able to allow us to be able to use a program such as our HOPE for Homeowners program to make sure that we are doing everything we do as he purchases these assets to put the ingredients in place that we can bring down these foreclosures and keep individuals in their homes, and I have  presented this four-point plan to you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield back to me briefly, I thank him very much. He has been working hard on this, and has also not just professed this in general, but has made some specific suggestions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the four points, two will take separate legislation, and I will work with the gentleman because I am in agreement with him on them, in concept. Two of them, however, are, I believe, able to be accomplished in this bill. I have spoken to the Secretary of the Treasury and, I believe, working together with the gentleman, we can make sure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just say specifically. Asset managers to support loan modifications will be very important for this success. The bill encourages the Treasury to consider the FDIC, which has been superlative in this regard, to play this role. Also, Treasury, under this bill, can buy virtually any mortgage asset, and we direct them to coordinate with the other agencies, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, and to maximize modifications through the program we just adopted.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The time of the gentleman has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield the gentleman 30 additional seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will expect the Secretary to use both direct assets and design--to provide special considerations for assets where HOPE for Homeowners or other programs have been used. In other words, we are directing the Treasurer to use his authority to maximize, exactly as the gentleman has proposed. We will continue to press the Secretary, and I believe we don't have to press too hard. He is ready to do this. And we will work with the gentleman on the other issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank you, Mr. Chairman, for including certainly two of those four. I deeply appreciate that. Homeowners who are struggling across this country appreciate that. We thank you for that. I want you to know that I will support the bill and I will encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield myself 15 seconds to say that the gentleman can tell his brother-in-law, Hank Aaron, he hit .500 today, and that's pretty good in any league.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I certainly will. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I come to the floor realizing that there is a problem on Wall Street that will affect Main Street, and I also come here today hopeful, but also realistic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not be supporting this bill today, but I know the bill will pass later on because so much has been added to it to get the votes. But I am hopeful then that all the promises that have been made by the proponents of this bill will come true, after we give $700 billion to Secretary Paulson and whoever follows him 2 or 3 months from now. The promise is that the markets will open up and the markets will go up and credit will be free-flowing soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I come here also realistic, realistic to know that if you don't tackle the underlying problems, we will be right back in this House again on this floor seeking more money and more reform. Realistic also to know if you don't allow for alternatives, you will not get the best bill. And we know that Speaker Pelosi and the White House were not open to listening to any alternatives, and there were alternatives out there. And realistic also in knowing that if you fail to investigate earlier  enough, these problems will come up, as they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in the spring of this year, we, my Republican colleagues, asked for investigations on this matter, and we were rebuffed, being told by the chairman, "I do not think it is necessary that we have hearings on the soonest possible date."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I come here not in support of this bill, but in support of doing something, in light of the remarks of economist Robert Shimer, who said, "The U.S. has long been a beacon of free markets. When economic conditions turn sour in other countries, we give very clear instructions on what to do; balance the budget, maintain free trade, the rule of law, and do not prop up failing enterprise."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said it. I agree with him. That has always been the U.S. approach, and I believe it is the correct approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when the United States ignores its own advice in this situation, we reduce our credibility of this stance. Rewriting the rules of the game at this stage will therefore have serious ramifications, not only for the people of this country, but for the globe and the world as well. You see, Madam Speaker, the social costs of this are far, far greater than the $700 billion that we talk about today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of the Senate amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the bailout proposal before us, and I do not voice my support without some trepidation. However, I feel that the state of our economy is such that we have no logical and prudent choice except to act and to do so now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many people across America, I am not happy about using public money to benefit the robber barons on Wall Street. Therefore, I am pleased to see the high level of independent oversight contained in this package. I know that many people are saying that there is no real help for home owners, for people facing foreclosure, and for those who have already lost their homes and/or their life savings. Therefore, I am pleased to note that this package provides for loan modifications which state concretely  that when:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. The government owns the entire loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The Secretary of the Treasury and other agencies [FDIC, Federal Reserve, FHFA, GSE's] must:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A. coordinate efforts to gain ownership and control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>B. create a Government-wide plan to maximize loan modifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary must:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Work with services to modify loans under Hope for Homeowners programs now strengthened to: (a) Allow homeowners to refinance before reset, (b) provide flexibility on  loan-to value-ration, and (c) speed up waivers for second mortgage holders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The Secretary must also fund support to services to ensure the ability to do loan modifications, i.e., loans to cover capital advances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Will offer loan guarantees to induce mortgage holders to make substantial loan modifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Applies to loans that may not be eligible for other Government refinancing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. The Secretary where permissible shall permit bona-fide tenants current in their rent to remain in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The interagency plan for maximizing loan modifications must include protecting Federal, State, and local rental subsidies and ensuring that any loan must take into account the need for operating subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I know that there has been and continues to be a great deal of talk about sweeteners. Well I use Equal, and I am ecstatic to note that in this package, serious consideration is being given to the concept of mental health parity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is a sweetener which would have influenced my position and my vote, this is it. No, this is not a perfect bill and I am sure that some people on Wall Street will benefit; but I do believe that more people on Main Street will feel safer and more secure that their investments are being protected, that their homes and insurance policies will be saved and their children's futures will be more secure. I vote "yes."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation and commend the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank, and our Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, for taking a bad bill from the Bush administration and turning it into a bill which protects taxpayers, contains important oversight provisions and ensures that there will be proper control of pay and no golden parachutes for executives whose recklessness has contributed to this crisis. Inaction is not an option here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts for the extraordinary job he has done, and I would like to engage him in a brief colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, domestic automobile manufacturers face the most difficult conditions they have faced in decades. We need to do something to help unfreeze the credit markets for that industry, as well as all others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I read the legislation, the Secretary has authority to purchase from a motor vehicle finance company traditional car loans and mortgage-related papers such as home equity loans used to purchase a car or truck. Is that interpretation correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, yes, it is. And I believe, as he and I have discussed, that the danger to the purchase of automobiles is one of the great ones that we face here, and it is an important reason for moving this bill. Yes, I very much agree with what he just said.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman, and I also want to point out one additional point of clarification, that if the Federal Reserve Board would use the authority it has to address extraordinary circumstances in credit markets, finance companies, particularly motor vehicle finance companies, would have access to capital that would help them to finance dealer floor plans and make consumer loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman support a decision by the Federal Reserve to make funds available, as long as the companies face unusual and extraordinary market conditions?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to say I absolutely support free market principles. I have no interest in bailing out Wall Street. I think that we need to reduce the size of government, and I believe that government intervention should not occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is not a normal situation. I have not seen anything like this. I wasn't around during the Great Depression, but having read about it, I have not seen anything like this in our financial services industry since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Banks are not lending to banks, and if banks don't lend to banks, the access to credit in the private sector really is going to dry up, because if they won't lend to each other, they are not going to want to lend to the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small businesses in this country are starting to hurt now. I spoke to a friend I have known for over 30 years who is a contractor who works for a very large company, and the company doesn't know right now, the employees, that many are going to get laid off, because their lines of credit have been dramatically reduced, and without credit in this country, it is going to have an impact on businesses, and if businesses are impacted, they are not the bad people, they are the ones who provide jobs  in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, I will say, is not perfect, but there are not many options we have today, and the last thing we can afford to do is do nothing and let the system start to crumble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small people, I say "small" because they are not business people, they are trying to work for a living, and I take the word "small" back, average people out there who are just working for a living and trying to make ends meet, supporting their families and paying their bills, they are the ones that are going to get hurt. This is not to bail out a bunch of fat cats on Wall Street. The people who made their money two or three years ago, they made their money. You can't impact that. We can change  things in the future to change the law to make sure people are protected and their investments are protected and people don't take advantage of the system, and that has to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this bill has grown in size, but much of it has to do with tax extenders. It is not pork. When you are talking about allowing child tax credits to continue, like we have in the past, the alternative minimum tax patch to continue, research and development tax credit, teacher expense deductions, those things have been added to this bill and the bill has absolutely grown in size.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's not lose the focus on what we are trying to do here today. The thing we are trying to do is stabilize the economy, not bail out individual businesses; make sure the economy can continue to run, people can work and businesses can operate. That is why I am rising in support of this bill and ask for an "aye" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot of discussion about making sure that businesses, homeowners and farmers all over this country have access to credit to buy inventory or finance a new home or purchase seed for next year's crops. We have several agencies within the Federal Government whose mission it is to provide credit directly to Main Street, to small businesses, to homeowners, to farmers and to people all over this country. Those agencies include the Small Business Administration, the Federal  Home Loan Banks and the Farm Credit Administration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, the answer is yes.

    <paragraph>There aren't many times we get a second chance to do the right thing. This is the kind of vote our constituents sent us to make on their behalf. It is a legacy vote, one of the  most important votes we will ever cast, a vote we will carry with us the rest of our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of my constituents have voiced opposition to this bill, but the fact is, the financial markets lost $1.2 trillion in one day when we failed to act Monday afternoon. Some of that has been restored, but we are witnessing the possibility of our economy coming to a grinding halt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't intend to play Russian roulette with our economy, or my constituents, which is why I voted for this bill when it came before us on Monday, and why I will vote for it again today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us on both sides of the aisle agree this is not a perfect bill. In fact, some of my financially savvy constituents have educated me about other ways we could intervene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is this legislation is a short-term solution to address a longer-term problem. Those of us back next Congress, and I make no assumption about my own election, truly have our work cut out for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is for Main Street. It is for college and retirement savings and the value of homes. It is for access to car loans, student loans and mortgages. It is the ability of small businesses to borrow, expand, stock shelves, meet short-term cash needs such as payroll, and invest in new plants and equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit market is tightening, strangling our economy. Liquidity has dried up and money is simply not getting to the individuals and businesses who need it. Consumers, savers and investors are losing confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful the bill before us today will increase deposit insurance to $250,000, a recommendation I had made, so American depositors know their money in their bank is safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This crisis requires all of us to put our country first and our ideology and partisanship aside. We need to pass the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and then go back home and face the voters. Those of us who are fortunate enough to return will have to come back, roll up our sleeves and do everything we can to help our country grow and our prosperity return.</paragraph>

Banks, and in particular some State-chartered institutions, are allowed to hold such stock in passive investment vehicles where the bank  is the majority investor under Federal law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It should be said that Republican leaders and my colleagues worked hard to improve this bill. They removed outrageous subsidies, and today the bank deposits of Americans are safer and the balance sheet of their local bank is more secure because of Republican leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even with these important improvements, this legislation remains the largest corporate bailout in American history. It forever changes the relationship between government and the financial sector and passes the cost along to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad part is, Madam Speaker, there are no easy answers, but there were alternatives. House Republicans offered an insurance program that would have required Wall Street, not Main Street, to pay for the cost of this recovery, and fast-acting tax relief to strengthen our economy from within.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teddy Roosevelt said, "An American must face life with resolute courage, win victory if he can and accept defeat if he must, without seeking to place on his fellow man a responsibility which is not theirs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, we place upon the American public a responsibility which is not theirs, bailing out financial institutions after they made irresponsible decisions. This we should not do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the last few days we have heard about LIBOR, commercial papers, spreads, swaps, about the credit markets. This chart shows you just how bad things are in the credit markets. But what does any of this stuff mean? What is credit? Credit is confidence, it is credibility, trustworthiness in someone's ability to pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, our system is plagued with fear. There is no confidence. There is no trust. Lenders don't trust borrowers; sellers don't trust buyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, as flawed as it is, goes right to this issue. If it works, it stops that fear from spreading into outright panic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will this bill prevent a recession? No, I don't think it will. But it will help us make sure that a recession is short and shallow, and not deep and long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know one thing for sure. Doing nothing is the worst thing we could do. This is one of those once-in-a-century kind of crises, and we need to act to prevent it from becoming a once-in-a-century kind of a recession. In Wisconsin, we are already beginning to see the beginning of this. We are already starting to see the job losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, this is a conscience vote. We of all people understand public opinion. We know it is not popular. But we see that gathering storm, we see it out there on the horizon. Our constituents may be outside mowing their lawns and looking up and seeing a sunny sky, but we see those storm clouds developing. And I want to know for sure that when the choice was made, I had made the decision to prevent that storm from gathering, to prevent those jobs from being lost, to protect our constituents from  losing their retirement funds, from not getting that home loan, that car loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make sure that what we do here today snaps that fear out of the market and preserves those jobs, and makes sure that the bumpy road we are going to have is not nearly as bumpy  as it would otherwise be if this bill fails.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague from Wisconsin about once a century, and this is that occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of my 39 years in Congress, I have fought against trickle-down economics and the mindless deregulation that has produced today's economic crisis. I opposed the repeal of Glass-Stiegel, which has made the problem so much worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The boy geniuses on Wall Street do not deserve to be rescued. But if they fall off their perches at the top of the economic ladder, they will crush innocent people far down that ladder on lower rungs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes in life, if we are responsible, we have to clean up not just the messes that we have created but the messes that others have created as well. This is one of those times. This package will not prevent a severe recession. We are going to see that, but it can buy us more time to make more basic changes that will stand this country in good stead over the long haul, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is something in life called the Hobson's choice. And I never thought I would be here, and I think Dave Hobson who is retiring probably thinks it is named after him, but it is not. And what we are being told today is that we either give $700 billion to the Secretary of the Treasury because he says that is what is needed, in a plan that is untested, unworked; or, and if we don't just write this check, we are being told that all of our constituents are going to lose their life savings,  their 401(k)s, their retirements. That is one hell of a choice, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I come today with a big problem. The big problem is, where did the number come from? The number, Forbes Magazine last week, Treasury spokeswoman: It is not based on any data point. We just wanted to choose a really large number. Well, you know what: $700 billion is a really large number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night we took an amendment to the Rules Committee, asked them to make it in order to stop this process, slow it down by a day. The vote was 8-4, along party lines. Eight Democratic members of the Rules Committee, who represent about 4.8 million people, told 305 million Americans we couldn't have a vote on that or anything else, including measures that are important to Democrats, such as bankruptcy and things of that nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill left the House and it went over to the Senate, and they larded it up: $192 million for rum. I guess we got the pirate vote in November. $100 million for NASCAR. $81 million for Hollywood. And my favorite, $2 million for wooden arrows for children. Now, I want children to have wooden arrows, but it doesn't belong in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have got to tell you, as a Republican I have never seen--I am finishing my 14th year--what just happened on the last vote. And we all know that folks back home don't pay attention to the rules. Twenty Republicans voted for the Democratic rule. If those 20 Republicans had not voted for that rule, we could have had an amendment on the floor, saving America $450 billion, which, as our friends like to tell us, is 4 years in Iraq, and we could have cut the pork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As John McCain says, and sadly, for those 20 Republicans and those who aided and abetted them: we will make you famous, and you shall know their names. Shame on you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I voted against the Iraq war resolution, the PATRIOT Act, the FISA Act amendments; and I led the opposition to the bankruptcy bill just a few years ago, in each case because I thought we were being railroaded into unwise actions through the use of fear tactics. But I do not believe that to be the case now. Now we face a very real crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit markets are shutting down. People will not be able to get car loans, loans for store inventories. There will be thousands of bank failures, millions of job losses. I believe we stand now literally on the brink of the abyss, and that we haven't seen such a situation since 1931.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is in many ways a weak bill. There should have been far more help for people facing foreclosures. There should have been bankruptcy reforms. There should have been real revenues to pay for it. There should have been a real stimulus to the economy. But this is the only bill that could be agreed upon now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not sure this bill will solve the crisis, but it might. It will buy us time for a better solution. As between a certainty of catastrophe and a possibility of averting that catastrophe, I will vote for the possibility of averting the catastrophe. I urge everyone else to do so.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. And I am not opposed to it for political reasons, I am not opposed to it for partisan reasons, I am not opposed to it for emotional reasons. I am opposed to it because fundamentally it doesn't address the problem that needs to be addressed. We have a crisis in our financial markets, we have a crisis of confidence in our credit markets, and this bill only indirectly addresses those problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, from the taxpayers' standpoint, it is not paid for. The underlying bill is going to raise the national debt ceiling $1.5 trillion. That is $1,500 billion. If you add the tax extender package that came over from the Senate, you end up with a price tag of approximately $2 trillion. Absolutely nothing in the bill addresses how to pay for those $2 trillion that puts taxpayers at risk. Really, for that one reason we should vote against the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked a lot about the crisis in the credit markets. My good friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) just put up a chart on the LIBOR rate, which is the overnight interbank loan rate from London. It is at 4 percent. It was at 4.5 percent 1 year ago. It is within its normal range. The spread has gone up between the overnight Treasury rate and the LIBOR rate, but that is because the Treasury rate has gone down to 2 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An auto loan that my good friend was talking about, the distinguished Financial Services chairman, the auto rate loan right now is 6.5 percent, about what it was a year ago. The credit markets are working, but there are some people holding back credit, hoping that the taxpayers will bail them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fundamentally, we need to address the American economy. This bill doesn't do that. You want the value of the dollar to go up? How about cutting spending and lowering the deficit? You want to do something on auto sales? How about produce more domestic energy to bring gasoline prices down.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if I might make an inquiry of the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my reading of the bill, I am trying to understand whether it is your belief that the Treasury has the authority under this legislation to use some portion of that $700 billion to deal directly with homeowners, specifically with homeowners facing foreclosure. And could you clarify for me the circumstances under which the Treasury has that authority when it wholly owns the mortgage, and when that mortgage is being serviced by loan servicing centers?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman will yield, the answer is, absolutely. And I can tell you that I have spoken to the Treasury, to the  Secretary, to tell him that it is very important; that many Members will be voting for this bill only with the understanding that he will use that authority. And I believe he accepts that fact and will act on it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412263" topic="III. TENANT PROTECTIONS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for clarifying that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that case, and hearing that clarification, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. I believe that we are just standing at a really important time in our economy. And while I voted "no" in opposition on Monday for the earlier package, hearing your clarification and the authority of the Secretary of Treasury to deal directly with addressing foreclosures that many people in my community are facing and across this country, I stand in support of the bill.  I know that it is not enough, but I realize that it is important for us to move forward and to create the circumstances, whether it is bankruptcy or directly dealing with homeowners, that we will be able to help people save their homes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Some things have changed in this bill, but taxpayers will still be picking up the tab for Wall Street's party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to stand together with a group of women from both sides of the aisle and ask for real reform, not a temporary fix. We still have no fundamental reform to Fannie and Freddie, nothing that resembles the amendments that I supported in 2005 and 2007 that would have avoided this debacle in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of suspending mark-to-market, we are going to study the possibility of it. Instead of requiring Wall Street to purchase insurance on their mortgage-backed securities and work out of the problem, we are still bailing them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am voting against this today because it is not the best bill, it is the quickest bill. Taxpayers for generations will pay for our haste, and there is no guarantee that they will ever see the benefits. We should not reward bad behavior. Wall Street won't have to learn its lesson, and we are not doing anything to keep them from running our economy into the ground again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Senate amendment to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. I will vote "yes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one wants to be voting on this legislation today because none of us want to be in the horrific economic situation in which our country finds itself. The greed and lack of regulatory oversight that got us into this mess should never have happened. However, today we have to deal with the practical economic reality. Inaction is not an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not about bailing out Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is about making sure that average Americans can continue to get credit for their basic needs like housing, students loans, and automobiles. It is about saving pensions for our retirees and making sure that the small businesses that are the engines of growth in my district can continue to get the credit they need to operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not perfect and doesn't have everything I would like. However, the changes that have been made to the original proposal by Secretary Paulson address many of the concerns of my constituents. The changes will protect taxpayers, keep people in their homes and rein in huge CEO salaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will allow the American people to see where this money is being spent and what is being purchased. Many of the tax extenders that the Senate added are needed to keep our country competitive and bring tax relief to average Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Continuing Resolution included $2.5 billion to address shortfalls and projected cost increases in the Pell Grant Program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Still needed are $2 billion to address the anticipated shortfall for 2008. This has to be addressed by Fiscal Year 2010. Additionally, there another $1 billion may be needed for 2009, which would have to be addressed by 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The frozen credit markets have affected the ability of student loans providers to raise capital to offer student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ensuring Continued Access to Federal Student Loans Act (<bill type="h" number="5715">H.R. 5715</bill>) was extended through 2010. This legislation gives the Secretary of Education the authority to purchase federal student loans from lenders, thereby injecting liquidity into the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $700 billion rescue package gives the Secretary of Treasury the authority to purchase troubled assets that the Secretary determines necessary for the health of the economy. Freeing up the credit markets will help lenders, including student loan lenders, in accessing the capital necessary to make college loans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This approach, their approach, will not work. It won't solve the credit crunch nor the mortgage foreclosure challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wall Street speculators, now the major donors in Federal campaigns, have used their considerable influence inside the halls of government, especially at the U.S. Treasury, to open up the piggy bank. Meanwhile, taxpayers across Main Street, who will pay the bill, will find it has no effect on bettering their lives as unemployment increases, foreclosures increase, and the squeeze on the middle class increases. The Treasury plan throws an ungodly amount at Wall Street. Yet all of our Congressional  committees but for one were relieved of their duties as regular order was dispensed with for a very hasty action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should do what we did back in the '70s, '80s and '90s and use the powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission to address the credit crunch without costing the taxpayers a penny.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, earlier this week on Monday, America hated this bill at $700 billion. Today they despise it at $850 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, apparently a majority in the House agreed with the callers and voted it down on a bipartisan basis. Yesterday I was very proud of the efforts of Representative Spencer Bachus who tried to bring to the floor a bill that would have slowed down this process, would have been something that I think the American public could have understood and fully supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, what we have before us today is the bill that the Senate sent to us. They sent us the same exact bill that the House rejected, but they added another $150 billion. It still bails out foreign banks and raises the debt limit $1 trillion. That is what people believe is business as usual here in Washington. The bill still does not address the issues of fear and diminished financial capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrat Senator Bill Nelson from my home State of Florida actually voted against this bill in the Senate. Like Senator Nelson, I wanted to see an extension of the deductibility of  State sales tax and an AMT patch, but that should have been in a separate bill. Instead it was added to this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is not a bill that I believe that I can vote for on behalf of my constituents. I said before that a vote for this bill is a vote to ratified business as usual in Washington. The added sweeteners and earmarks were only to get more votes.

  <speaking speaker="400311" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill because it won't solve our problem. It is said that we are in a liquidity crisis and a credit crunch and all we need is more credit. The Federal Reserve has already injected over a trillion dollars worth of credit and it doesn't seem to have helped a whole lot. Injecting another 600 to $700 billion will not solve the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one of the reasons why we are floundering around here is that we don't understand the problem because instead of it being a credit crunch, I think it is a lot more serious than that. That is, I think what is happening in the market today is signaling something much more draconian because it is probably telling us that our government is insolvent, that we are on the verge of bankruptcy and big things are starting to happen. And we don't quite understand it, so we fall back on the old cliches  that what we need is more appropriations, more spending, more debt, and more credit in the market. That means more inflation by the Federal Reserve system. And yet, that is what caused the trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to do this it is said to prevent the recession or depression because that is unbearable. But the truth is you should have thought about that 10 or 15 years ago because the financial bubble created by the excess of credit and the lowering of the interest rate is the cause of the recession. The recession is a demand. It is a must; you can't avoid it. Yes, it has been papered over several times over the last several decades, but that just made the bubble bigger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message is now you can't paper it over any longer. So the recession and/or depression will come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My sincere conviction is that by doing more mischief and not allowing markets to adjust, debt to be liquidated, you're going to guarantee a depression. It is going to be prolonged. The agony is going to be there for a lot longer than if you allow markets to adjust. Liquidation of debt. Let the bankruptcy occur, let the good assets come up, and let it react.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This idea that there is not enough regulation is completely wrong. There is too much regulation, and lack of regulation of the Federal Reserve system and the exchange of stabilization.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First I would like to thank Chairman Frank for the extraordinary work he has put into making sure we address this financial crisis, and do it in a way that will certainly protect our homeowners who are at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of Members who have been worried about whether or not this bill is going to protect our citizens on Main Street, as they refer to it. I worked with Chairman Frank and others on the modifying of loans portions of this bill. We have three ways by which these loans can be modified. People forget that when we buy up this toxic paper, when we buy up these nonperforming loans, we are in charge. Not only can we write down the principal, we can write down the interest. We  can do the kind of loan modification that we have been urging the Hope Now Alliance to get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, we are coordinating the work of all of the agencies that own paper, whether it is the FDIC or either of the GSEs, Fannie or Freddie. Remember, we own them now. We will be able to coordinate and set some standards and be able to do again the kind of loan modification that takes into consideration whatever the circumstances are of the particular homeowner. And in some cases, we will provide a loan guarantee. When we go in and ask some of the institutions to do loan modifications  on entire packages, those that fall out and they cannot do the loan modifications on that work very well, we will provide the loan guarantees for them to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for anybody who says there is nothing in this for homeowners, they are incorrect. Read the bill. The facts are there. This is the strongest part of this legislation, protecting homeowners and doing the kind of loan modifications that will keep people in their homes who have these adjustable rate mortgages even before they reset.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in a former life as Attorney General of California, I was required to sign off on any of the debt instruments that went to market to make sure that they followed the laws and the Constitution of the State of California. Never did we have difficulty floating short-term loans in California in anticipation of the income revenues that would be coming in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, just last night the governor of the State of California wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury indicating that California may very well have difficulty floating $7 billion in short-term loans to cover expenses. I can't recall when that ever happened before. The reason is the squeeze on the credit market. That ought to bring us some pause here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more importantly, over the last 2 days I was home in my district and I talked with people involved with hospitals, banks, automobile dealers, simple folks, my 91-year-old mother whose entire future is wrapped up in the investments my dad left her. She has no pension. She has what my dad left her. When you see the volatility of the market and the uncertainty out there, that spreads fear among our folks back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a perfect bill. Certainly I don't ever argue this is a perfect bill, but it is the best we have right now. I would ask my colleagues to please support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of you talking about the additional cost on the Senate side, the largest additional cost is fixing the AMT. It is the first time I have heard some of the people on my side of the aisle refer to that as a cost. That is giving taxpayers the kind of relief they deserve and preventing them from being put into higher tax brackets unnecessarily.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this time and for his tireless work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., for associating himself with my remarks this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think we need to be honest about the bill before us. It is a bailout. We should be honest with how we got here: reckless deregulation policies and greed. We should be honest about the fact that we don't know that this is the appropriate economic strategy. Some economists say yes; some economists say no. But I must be honest about the fact that I can't afford to risk the consequences of inaction based on what I know today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke with our California treasurer this week, and he assured me that people will suffer greater pain, including cuts to critical State-funded social services, county services, and schools, if we don't do something to stop this hemorrhaging. That is why I will vote for this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former small business owner, I know access to credit will make or break your business. Without it, people will lose jobs. We will not magically turn the economy around, reverse the rise in unemployment, or end this recession which we are in now. We must be honest about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I must err on the side of caution so our seniors can have some confidence that their pensions are safe. And I hope that we will be able to prevent this financial crisis from exacting an even bigger toll on the everyday lives of our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Jackson and I will continue to fight for regulatory reform and a direct economic stimulus package that we fought to be included in this bill. We must have bankruptcy reform and a moratorium on foreclosures. But I am glad to say that our fight has helped slow this bill down. Thanks to our Speaker's leadership, we have a bill today to extend unemployment compensation insurance on the floor. That is the least we can do for those in need on Main Street. I urge the other body  to take it up immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Obama said, there will be a time to punish those who set this fire, but now is the moment for us to come together and put the fire out. Congressman Jackson and I join him in that effort and we will vote for this flawed but necessary legislation. It is a very difficult vote for both of us, but I must do everything I can to stop this bleeding in the lives of people living from paycheck to paycheck, that is if they have a paycheck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am really confident that this is the right vote, but I know that it is not the popular vote. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have to thank Congresswoman Maxine Waters for her leadership in trying to make some sense out of this foreclosure mess. Hopefully we will stop the bleeding, but I know that we have a lot of work to do.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>What was a problem at one time on Wall Street has become a problem for Main Street. What was a problem for this Congress and financial experts has become a problem for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As late as last night, Mr. LaTourette, Mr. Latham, and I were at the Rules Committee for 2 1/2  minutes urging the Rules Committee to only appropriate $250 billion, an enormous amount; yet they turned down our request. I want to thank my Republican colleagues on the Rules Committee for voting "yes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment said we would come back in November and we would give careful consideration to this. And if we needed more, if the program was working--and believe you me, it's been announced that it won't start for another 15 days whether we pass this bill today or tomorrow or the day after. And we could have all judged by then how it was working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that's past. And today is today. And I will be voting today for this bill because it's about the pensioner and his retirement check, it's about the small businessman and his ability to buy materials or make a payroll, and it's about that student, either in school or having to leave school, or that student preparing for school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whatever the problem was before, however you disagree with certain parts of this bill, our only choice is "yes" or "no." And when a problem becomes an American problem, and it is, then it is time for Congress to take decisive action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be voting "yes" on this bill; not a perfect bill, but a bill that I am not willing to pass up because I'm not willing to risk capitalism and a decline into socialism if our financial markets and our economy collapses.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time and thank him so much for his hard work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and believe this bill must be enacted as soon as possible to stop our country from falling deeper into recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Madam Speaker, we received information that our economy has lost 159,000 additional jobs. This brings the total job loss for this year to 760,000. But Madam Speaker, jobs are not the only thing Americans across this country are losing. They are losing their hold on the American Dream. That dream, Madam Speaker, is economic mobility and homeownership. Nowhere is this problem more acute than in minority communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is not only about Wall Street. It's about Broad Street and Walker Street; it's about grocery stores, beauty shops, and barber shops. It's about community banks and auto dealerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the minority communities are hemorrhaging: jobs, homes, income, and most importantly credit. Consider this fact: African Americans received 35 percent of the subprime purchase loans issued from 2004 to 2007. Of these loans, 62 percent of them were reset to a higher rate by the end of 2008. Many of these homes' values have dropped by 25 percent. Access to refinancing credit is no longer available, and their pension plans have lost substantial value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These dynamics are devastating to minority communities, and I believe that we must pass this legislation in order to stop the hemorrhaging.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, thank you for all of the work that you have done. I'm angered, frustrated, and sad, but I believe that we've got to do the responsible thing. Therefore, I'm going to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, I find myself frustrated, angry and sad. Predatory lending and  greed are at the root of the current financial storm our Nation is facing. I voted against the bailout bill on Monday because I believe it did not do enough to provide direct relief to families that are facing foreclosure, and have been victimized by these practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few days, I have fought vigorously to include stronger foreclosure mitigation provisions in a revised bill. Many of my colleagues joined me in an effort to include language from my bill <bill type="h" number="4135">H.R. 4135</bill>, The Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation Act, in any revised rescue plan. This language would keep more families in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe today's bill still does not do enough to protect struggling homeowners, I am pleased that it does include critical improvements in the areas of oversight and accountability. This bill does a better job of protecting America's taxpayers, and ensuring their investment is not squandered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But sadly, our economy is now in turmoil. We find ourselves in a state of quicksand, and we are sinking fast. We cannot delay action any longer. I will vote for this bill today. Not because it solves all our problems, but because I do not have a choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the credit crunch is allowed to continue, the consequences for the Inland Empire will be disastrous. In my district, too many families are facing the possibility of being homeless. Credit unions and big banks have limited their lending, and as a result families are at a greater risk of losing their homes, their jobs and their opportunities for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Car loans have dried up, and some dealerships have closed and been forced to layoff workers. Student loan companies across the Nation have shut down or stopped participating in Federal student aid programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now, to make matters worse, we have received word that California needs a $7 billion emergency loan from the Government, in order to keep funding day-to-day operations. The consequences of doing nothing are too dire to imagine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without immediate Federal action, California will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for highway construction, schools, housing or water projects. And because of the extreme delay in passing the state budget, California's cash reserves would be exhausted by the end of October without this loan. This means that payments for teachers' salaries, nursing homes, law enforcement and every other State-funded service would stop or be significantly delayed. This must not be allowed to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, today's bill is about providing confidence in our markets and stabilizing our economy. We must do this if we are to protect our jobs at home, stop further outsourcing, and ensure our society has access to the credit it needs to run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The market dropped on Monday because of a lack of confidence. Because of predatory lending and the complete lack of regulation we have seen from the Bush administration in the last 8 years, Wall Street has been allowed to run amok--and because of that the American people have suffered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am voting for this bill today to restore that confidence. But we must come back and work on a more comprehensive package that will provide the assistance America's working families need to survive in these difficult economic times. I have received a commitment from the House Financial Services Committee that hearings will be held next February to examine my bill, the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, and move it forward in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration and the rubber stamp Republicans in Congress are responsible for the lack of leadership and effective government oversight that caused this crisis, but we all must work together to get America back on track. I am confident that with a change of leadership, we will stabilize our Nation's financial markets and keep America's working families safe and secure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Today's grim jobless number showed that the problems facing Main Street are mounting. If we do not pass a financial rescue package today, credit markets may fail and working families and businesses will suffer. Consumers are the lifeblood of our economy, and most families need access to credit to make major purchases like buying a home, a car, or paying for college tuition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without financing, families will cut back on spending, businesses will see sales plummet, our economy will weaken, and even more jobs will be lost.

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the bill before us has been vastly improved over the bill sent to us, and all of those improvements are still here. But this bill was waylaid in the Senate to add unrelated matters, which is not a good way to legislate, and I do not defend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the major adds extend expiring tax cuts, which we would extend anyway in time, and to fix the AMT to keep it from coming down on middle income Americans, and sooner or later, we would adjust the AMT. In regular order, we would offset those tax reductions so that they do not add to the deficit. This bill contains only partial offsets, but there is remarkable improvements to the code here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, one shining example, this bill closes a gaping loophole and saves $25 billion, a gaping loophole in the tax code, which has long allowed managers of hedge funds to shelter their income in places like the Caymans and dodge taxation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final point. Throughout, this has been called a $700 billion bailout, but we should bear in mind three points: first, $700 billion will be the gross cost if all of it is drawn down. The net cost should be a lot less.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and Members of this House, I said that last Monday would be a day of consequence. It was a day of consequence. We have been criticized as a body for not deciding affirmatively on Monday. What we did decide, however, was that initial failure should not stand because the crisis confronting our country was too great. And Republicans and Democrats together, administration and Congress, chairman and ranking member, each individual Member decided that failure was not an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the dividing line in this House was not between parties--it was between those who believed the dangers of doing nothing outweighed their  reservation about Monday's bill and those who had yet to be convinced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, I believe that the number of the convinced that this action is essential has grown. Some were convinced when a vote in the Chamber led to the evaporation of $1.2 trillion of wealth in about 120 seconds; some were convinced when they heard that America lost another 159,00 jobs last month making a total of lost jobs this year of 760,000 jobs. In a similar period 8 years ago, we had gained 1.5 million jobs--a net turnaround of over 2.2 million jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are in trouble. They're expecting us to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some were convinced by the stories like this one from a small town car dealer in Utah. He said this: "I'm not going to be able to pay my employees next week. I can't get the kind of credit line from the bank that I have had through my entire career unless you do something."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill outreaches not only to minorities but to small businesses as well. And I thank the gentlelady from California for her focus on that issue and Mr. Bachus for his focus on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens on Wall Street is bound up with the jobs of millions on Main Street, and the retirement of millions on Main Street, and the homes of millions in hometown America, and dreams of millions of our fellow Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>If disaster strikes those few square miles in Manhattan, it will surely spread until every one of those jobs and retirements and homes and dreams are put at great risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week I've heard from the Prime Ministers of Australia and Japan who are telling us that their people are bracing themselves, worried that America will not rise to the occasion. I am proud to be a Member of this House, and when challenged, I believe this House rises to its responsibilities and I believe it will do so today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We sing the praises of American leadership, and today, I think we will deserve that praise. This is the responsibility that comes with our duty as Representatives in the people's House. For all of those reasons, this bill is essential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many of us have improved the administration's plan, Republicans and Democrats, working together, which came to us as a mere three-page bill, giving essentially a $700 billion blank check to the administration. Republicans and Democrats knew as one that that could not stand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The heart of the bill remains a plan for the government to buy up bad financial assets, restoring the flow of credit so essential to the growth and maintenance of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we fought to ensure that taxpayers will be the first to profit if and when those assets rise again in value, making the true price tag of this bill far, far less than $700 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in the history of America, has said this, "If they do it right, and I think they'll do it reasonably right"--his expectation is that we will do it reasonably right--he said, if we do that, we'll make a lot of money, we being the taxpayers of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have the opportunity not only to save our economy, to save those dreams of our fellow citizens, but also to make some profit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we made sure the financial community will be obligated to pay the taxpayers back for their loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We restricted executive compensation because CEOs whose recklessness helped bring on this crisis should not receive taxpayer-subsidized golden parachutes or extraordinary salaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are subjecting the Treasury Secretary's decisions to strong oversight. Republicans and Democrats together agreed that that should be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we will help homeowners renegotiate their mortgages to prevent a further flood of 2 million projected foreclosures. That's what this bill is about. That is the action we are asked to take today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday, the Senate raised Federal insurance of bank accounts from $100,000 to $250,000, and also chose to add several tax cuts. I personally believe that raising the FDIC can be argued on both sides of the question, but certainly, it ought to stabilize our local banks. However, as all of you know, I strongly disagree with adding those tax provisions because the Senate has chosen to finance them with debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This crisis is making it painfully clear the dangers of fiscal recklessness and that debt does indeed matter. A lesson, in my opinion, the Senate has ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But an emergency like this calls for the courage to compromise. On Monday, Chairman Frank said, "If we aren't prepared to accept some of the things we don't like, we will not have the power to deliver for the people we care about." The chairman was absolutely right. For me, those people are families unable to take out a loan to buy an appliance or pay for college. They are Americans who have worked their whole lives only to see their retirement accounts threatened. They are the millions  of workers fearing a pink slip they did nothing to earn. For their sake, for their sake, we must act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of us to pass this legislation. I urge all of us to vote for this legislation. I know there will be some who will not vote for this legislation. I want them to know that I respect their judgment. We have a difference of opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, America was deeply divided, and their representative body, not surprisingly, was deeply divided. In the last 4 days, Americans in small towns, on farms, in urban areas and suburban areas have reflected upon the consequences of inaction, and while they have not come to the universal thought that we ought to pass this bill, they have told us in the strongest terms we expect the people's House to act in a way that they think best to save our economy, to protect our dreams, to make America  whole again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We all know that we are in the midst of a financial crisis, and we all know that this crisis is about our neighbors. It's about our small businesses. It's about retirees whose savings are on the line. It's about the American people and their jobs. And we know that if we do nothing, this crisis is likely to worsen and to put us into an economic slump like most of us have never seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've come together on a bill that is a much better bill than it was when it started. It isn't the bill that I would write. It's not the bill that any of you would write because this bill was done in a bipartisan way, where Members on both sides of the aisle came together, worked together to build a product that we thought would help avert this crisis. It certainly has grown in size, but to do nothing, in my view, is not an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The consequences of us not acting are overwhelming, and so I do believe that it's our responsibility to act. The American people sent us here to do our jobs on their behalf. They're counting on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that some of you will disagree with the bill that we have before us, and I understand and respect those views. But while we have an imperfect product, we have a responsibility to act and to act in a way that we will do our best on behalf of our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have talked to a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle who were stuck in really difficult elections, and doing this bill in the middle of an election is complicated enough. And I've had Members worried about how this is going to affect their election. I told them that whether you vote "yes" or you vote "no," you've got to go home and defend this. And it's a lot easier to defend your vote if you, in your own mind, will just do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm going to vote for this bill today because I think it's in the best interests of the American people. That's what they sent us here to do, and that's what I'm going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above the Speaker's rostrum is our motto: "In God We Trust." This is probably one of the most serious votes that any of us will ever cast. I've said my prayers this morning, like I do  every morning, so that I can understand and feel better about the vote that I cast. But even if we pass this bill today, let's not kid ourselves. We're in the midst of a recession. It is going to be a rough ride, but it will be a whole lot rougher ride if we don't pass  this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I will say to all of you, when this bill passes today, remember those words, "In God We Trust," because we're going to need His help.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, recognizing the end of insurance discrimination towards the mentally ill and praising my colleague Jim Ramstad and Dave Wellstone, whose father is looking down on us today in praise of his son for all the hard work he did to see this day come to pass, I urge passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I do support the rescue package and commend Chairman Barney Frank for his work producing this legislation, I rise today to speak about the mental health parity bill which is included in this package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us in Congress who have been fighting to bring greater fairness and equity to our insurance laws, today is the culmination of a long struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we send this package to the President, we will be providing 113 million Americans the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your health insurance will be there when you need it--regardless of your diagnosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, health insurance companies have used the stigma of mental illness and substance abuse as an excuse to deny coverage for those biological disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That ends today. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 will finally outlaw the discrimination that is embedded in our laws and our policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this legislation is one more step in the long civil rights struggle to ensure that all Americans have the chance to reach their full potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are too many people to thank individually, so I would like to focus on two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For as long as I have been in Congress, Jim Ramstad has been a champion for those with mental illness and substance abuse disorders. His advocacy on this issue has been inspiring to millions of Americans, and to me personally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a role model for me, both personally and professionally. This Congress could use far more members like Jim Ramstad, on both sides of the aisle. This body will miss him terribly when he retires at the end of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other person I would like to recognize is Dave Wellstone. As most everyone here knows, Senator Paul Wellstone was the original champion of mental health parity in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he passed away, many of us thought that the momentum he had created for this bill would go with him. But his son Dave picked up the torch and has carried it tirelessly to get us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave, I know your father is watching us today, and I cannot imagine the pride he must feel. Congratulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, this legislation strikes a blow against the stigma and discrimination faced by those with mental illness. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, to close with a burst of redundancy, which is not inappropriate for what we've been through on this bill, I yield to Madam Speaker for 1 minute.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 1 minute.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for being such a great maestro in orchestrating this legislation that we have before us, accompanied by so many others; Congresswoman Waters for her tremendous leadership. We recognize Congressman Spratt of the Budget Committee; Congresswoman Slaughter for her work on the Rules Committee to bring this bill to the floor; Congressman Rangel for his very, very important  work as well and having a piece of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Spencer Bachus for his leadership and some of the great ideas that he brought to the table that first night and continued to bring to the discussion as we have gone ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's been my pleasure to work with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt on this and with my colleague Mr. Hoyer who's invested so much time; and our mastermind, Rahm Emanuel for his knowledge of Wall Street, his knowledge of Congress, and his leadership was essential in our reaching the point we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The place that we are today is to debate legislation that I think is much improved from the product that was here on Monday, and as we debate this legislation, we must do so with an eye to the future. We must reassure the American people that this crisis will lead to reforms that will strengthen their personal economic security, that the bright light of accountability will protect the taxpayers and ferret out the abuses that have led to this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The urgency is clear. We hear it from our friends, from our neighbors. We hear it everywhere we turn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of California, officials including the Governor are urgently calling for Federal legislation to avoid economic catastrophe, catastrophe. Those urgent calls are being echoed by Democratic and Republican Governors from across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>While the focus has been on the Dow Jones and Wall Street, we are addressing the real pain felt by Mr. and Mrs. Jones on Main Street. They are why we must pass this legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seniors and those nearing retirement have watched their savings dwindle and their pensions evaporate. Entrepreneurs seeking a plan for a new business are being turned away for credit, undermining job creation. If you're trying to buy a car, you cannot get a car loan. If you're trying to sell cars, you cannot get a business loan to purchase inventory. If you're trying to save for your children's college education, you are deeply in doubt as to whether your savings will be there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just this morning, the Labor Department announced that another 159,000 Americans lost their jobs in September, the most in 5 years. Nearly 800,000 Americans have lost their jobs this year alone. These are the Americans we must act on behalf of today. They are not the high flyers on Wall Street, but our neighbors and our constituents, and they need our help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us be clear, the original rescue bill proposed by the Bush administration was unacceptable, as has been indicated by Mr. Boehner. It has asked us to commit $700 billion in taxpayers' money with few strings and no safeguards. In a bipartisan way, we rejected that proposal. And in our bipartisan negotiations between the White House and the Congress, we demanded tough additions to the bill, and they are contained in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To protect the taxpayers, we insisted upon tough oversight and accountability. To further protect the taxpayers, we wanted to make sure that as we bought this illiquid paper that Mr. Paulson was talking about and as we invested capital into these companies that we were helping to make healthy, that the American taxpayer would profit. Mr. Spencer Bachus was quite vocal on that subject when we met that first Thursday night two weeks and one day ago about, if we're going to make these companies  healthier, why shouldn't we just invest capital in them so the taxpayer can benefit?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And thanks to John Tanner of Tennessee, if this does not pay for itself, as some say that it can, but if there is a shortfall, the taxpayer will be made whole, being paid for by fees on those who have benefited from the program. That recoupment that Mr. Tanner put forth I think is a tremendous advance in this legislation and a protection for the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also reform CEO compensation and put an end the golden parachutes. Our message to Wall Street is: The party is over. No longer will you drive your business into the ground, take a golden parachute to safety and have the taxpayer pick up the tab. And thanks to Congresswoman Maxine Waters, this legislation will do a great deal to help families avoid foreclosure and enable them to stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the bill came to the floor earlier this week, it has been further improved by increases in insurance for  checking and savings accounts which protect savers, small businesses and community banks across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that the plan benefits middle income families with an extension of the $1,000 per couple State and local property tax deduction; $1,000 for those who do not itemize deduction in their property taxes. And I thank Jim Clyburn, our Democratic whip, for his leadership in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the bill includes an extension of tax cuts for clean and renewable energy that will create and save half a million good-paying jobs in America immediately. This was a part of our energy bill last year. It did not survive the Senate, it now has become part of this legislation, and it is paid for. We fought hard to include these critical tax cuts, again, as I said, in last year's landmark legislation because they are essential to job creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And aren't we all pleased across America's cause for celebration that the legislation includes the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act? Patrick Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad--I hope he's here so I can convey to him the gratitude of the American people to both of them for their leadership, without which we would not be having this important legislation passed today. It has turned out to be the vehicle for which the whole package is moving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By requiring that illness in the brain be treated just like illness elsewhere in the body for insurance purposes, we're helping to end discrimination against those who seek treatment for mental illness. This legislation will also save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there are some things in here that have been added since the other day that are very important, legislation that has passed the House over and over again, but never could make it through the Senate, and now it has. That doesn't take away from the fact that we've been dealt a mighty bad hand with the core part of this legislation, but it has been improved. It is a compromise, but it is just the start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing this legislation is only the beginning of our work to protect the economic future of the American people. With the work in these past 2 weeks, we've seen things we never thought we would see before in terms of the economic insecurity of our own country. With this legislation, $700 billion, we have broken new ground in how we deal with this crisis, but we will not leave it broken. Chairman Waxman, Chairman Peterson and Chairman Frank will hold a series of hearings  to determine the origin of the crisis, how regulators and business leaders failed to protect the public interest, and the commonsense, reasonable regulations needed to provide security and stability in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must look ahead. We must look ahead to protect Americans from unsavory lending practices and to bring a better balance to our bankruptcy laws, but today we must begin by passing this bill. And as we do so, we must keep in mind our commitment to fiscal discipline, to not increasing the deficit. That's the overriding question I have from people--well, among others--why so much? Will it work? We'll see. What does it do to our opportunities to invest in the American people? Well, we hope it will  pay for itself. And if it doesn't, then the fees will be there to cover it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But apart from that, we cannot get into the thinking that we can just put out all this money without the thought that it will be heaping mountains of debt onto our children unless we have recoupment. And so it is a problem for us as we go into a new presidency and a new Congress. But under the leadership of Mr. Spratt, and working with others in the House and in the Senate and with a new President of the United States, "no new deficit spending" must be our mantra.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a vote with real consequences, a vote that will shape or begin to shape the financial stability of our country and the economic security of our people. It is an important vote, it's a difficult vote, but it is a vote that we must win for the American people. We must win it for Mr. and Mrs. Jones on Main Street.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412200" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the emergency financial rescue package I am supporting today, while far from perfect, contains noticeable improvements on the Paulson Plan we considered on Monday. This package is much more balanced in favor of helping everyday people, middle-class families, and small businesses. The bailout package we considered on Monday was simply too geared toward Wall Street and the corporations whose irresponsible practices helped create this crisis in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new financial rescue package raises the cap on FDIC-insured bank accounts from $100,000 to $250,000, which will assist families and small businesses while restoring Americans' confidence that their savings are secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new package provides tax relief for middle-class families and tax incentives designed to create new jobs and economic opportunities in Hawaii, where people have been hit hard by the economic downturn that preceded this financial crisis. The majority of the tax relief, tax credits, and tax extenders added to the package will provide direct relief and economic assistance to middle-class families and working people--such as the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, relief provision and tax credits to  speed research, development, and use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMT fix, for example, will prevent some 40,000 constituents in my second district of Hawaii from having to pay higher taxes that were originally intended only to affect wealthy taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The renewable energy tax credits are critical to encourage investment in the alternative energy projects Hawaii needs to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill reauthorizes for 2 years the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds, QZAB, program, which helps school districts with low-income populations save on interest costs associated with financing school renovations and repairs. Hawaii received about $1.3 million in QZAB allocations in 2005, 2006, and 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another significant provision of this bill requires insurance mental health parity legislation that advocates in Congress have been trying to pass for the past 10 years. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation. These provisions, included in the financial rescue package, will make sure that families struggling with mental illness do not have that challenge compounded by inadequate coverage of mental health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have voted for these energy, business, and middle-class tax relief measures earlier in the House. These provisions will help 30 million homeowners, create 500,000 American green jobs, and provide tax relief for well over 25 million middle-class families. Including those tax relief proposals as part of the financial rescue package has made the overall proposal more balanced, and more likely to help everyday people get through these difficult economic times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economic downturn we are facing, resulting in loss of jobs, foreclosures, and families having difficulty paying for life's necessities, will not be fixed by this relief bill. The economic provisions added to the bill will help. But we need a broader economic stimulus package to get our economy going in the right direction again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that it appears the Senate is not taking up the economic stimulus package (<bill type="h" number="7110">H.R. 7110</bill>) recently passed in the House, which will create jobs, extend unemployment benefits, help States with Medicaid reimbursements, and support our Food Stamp program. This bill represented some $222 million for Hawaii.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did talk to Senator OBAMA about his perspective and my concerns about this bill. We both know that much more work remains to be done to address the underlying economic and regulatory problems that won't be fixed with this bill. We agree that new Federal investments are needed in transportation and clean water infrastructure as well as in education to enhance our Nation's competitiveness and to put people to work. Senator OBAMA also shares my concern that the cost of this rescue  plan will not ultimately fall on the taxpayers, and he reassured me of his commitment to impose financial service fees to make taxpayers whole. With the right leadership in the White House, I am confident that we can make the changes needed in future legislation to protect homeowners and taxpayers and to reform our financial markets.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman of Financial Services BARNEY FRANK for bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor. I rise today with the confidence that our system of government is strong and the constitutional protections of the full faith and credit of our government must protect Main Street America while we reform America's Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many have claimed that this is a historic vote. Historic votes are not ubiquitous. Historic votes come about through necessity and not through the failures of people. This problem has persisted for a while and now Congress must rush before the recess to a vote. While I would have liked more time, time has seemingly run out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would begin by saying that I had concerns about the bill that was presented to the Congress on Monday. After much deliberation and a return visit to my district, I vote "yes" for this bill. Given these dire economic times, it is the responsible thing to do to vote "yes" when the mass of Americans are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you a picture of the tough economic times which face Americans. The economy is shredding jobs. The U.S. economy has lost jobs in every single month of 2008. In September, the economy suffered its biggest 1-month job loss,-159,000, in over 5 years. In total, the economy has shed 760,000 jobs since the beginning of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poor labor markets are significantly increasing unemployment. Within the past year, the number of unemployed Americans has increased by 2.2. million. In September, there were 9.5 million unemployed workers, keeping the unemployment rate at a 5-year high of 6.1 percent. Thus, it has become harder for Americans to find jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economy is faced with credit crunches. Individuals have found it difficult to get first or second mortgages, credit, credit cards, and loans, including student loans. Because of the compendium of these economic concerns, coupled with the drying up of the credit market, I have changed my vote from a few days ago from a "no" to a "yes." I changed my vote because of my concern for the well-being of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first three articles of the United States Constitution address the three branches of Government and their enumerated powers. These Articles govern the legislature, the executive, and the judicial branches. Because there is no specific grant of constitutional authority for the actions that will be taking place here today, we the Members of Congress need to exercise oversight over the powers and actions of the executive. Should the executive or its agencies exceed the powers granted to it in  the Constitution, the judicial can review the determinations made by the executive and the legislative branches. These concepts are fundamental to our Constitution and our system of constitutional checks and balances. These checks and balances were established by the Founding Fathers to reign in the unbridled power of the executive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are engaged in a fundamental exercise of the constitutional powers extended to the Congress. Today's vote is critically important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several questions come to mind when I consider the present financial crisis: Where was the FDIC? Where was the SEC? Where was the Federal Reserve?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with leadership to offer consistent amendments, not once but twice unsuccessfully, that would have strengthened the enforcement measures over the past week to change the administration's proposal to make it more encompassing, effective, and better for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the present legislation is impressive, it is also impressive regarding what needs clarification in the present legislation. For example, the legislation needs clarification on its bankruptcy restructuring, enforcement, and judicial review. These are all issues that I have been very concerned about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I am concerned and desire that the maximum number of Americans get relief from this bill, I offered amendments yesterday. To ensure that this bill provides relief for Americans, I offered the following amendments:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, many are concerned about the dollar amount that will be set aside for those individuals facing mortgage foreclosure. Therefore, I asked that language be inserted into the bill so that $10 billion be utilized for the Secretary of the Treasury to restructure mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, as Senator BARACK OBAMA has recently stated, he is committed to altering the bankruptcy code in the future to assist homeowners on the question of restructuring their mortgages. Therefore, I believe that there should have been Sense of Congress language that the Congress should review and amend the bankruptcy code to permit bankruptcy judges to address the question of individual home mortgage restructuring. This would have sent a clear message that Congress is interested in helping  Americans pay off their debt despite its not changing the bankruptcy code at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, there needs to be greater enforcement. In the section on judicial review, Section 119, there should have been language that specifically states that "the courts should be able to exercise their discretion to grant injunctive and/or equitable relief if the court determines that such relief would not destabilize financial markets."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the legislation should have created a new, independent commission to exercise oversight over what happened and the commission should regularly provide reports to Congress. This commission would be backward looking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, the legislation should have been narrowly crafted so that corporate executives who may be convicted of criminal malfeasance in the financial sector might be barred from conducting financial business with the Government for a period of 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixth, the legislation should have permanently lifted the present insurance cap of $100,000 that the FDIC has established to insure funds stored in FDIC-backed banking institutions to $250,000. I believe that this has already been included in the Senate bill; but, my amendment would have made the change permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventh, in section 109, which addresses "foreclosure mitigation efforts," the language should be changed from "shall encourage" to "shall require" to provide stronger relief for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, current section 109(a) states in pertinent part that "the Secretary shall implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and use the authority of the Secretary to encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages ..... to minimize foreclosures." I believe if the true intent is to bailout "Main Street," the Secretary should be "required" to minimize foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are certain redeeming qualities to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Board in section 104; Oversight and Audits in section 116; and a Congressional Oversight Panel in section 125. Therefore, these sections provide some oversight over the financial crisis and help to add one piece to the economic puzzle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without bankruptcy I offered an amendment that $10 billion should be set aside so that the Department of Treasury could use those funds to address the question of individuals facing home mortgage foreclosure. I considered it important to set aside money because I wanted to ensure that Main Street received something from this bailout and not just Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has labeled the current economic situation as a crisis that requires emergency measures. Our vote today in favor of the legislation is a first attempt at addressing these dire economic times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, my concern is to ensure that the American people receive the relief that they deserve. If the American people are facing mortgage foreclosure, it is my desire that monies be provided to them so that they can continue to stay in their home and pay their mortgages and their bills. Everyone deserves the economic dream of owning their own home. But the financial institutions were dilatory in their responsibility to assess the borrower's ability to pay for loans and purchase a home. It  was the squandering of this responsibility and preoccupation with greed and avarice that has led us to where we are today. I am not satisfied that this bill is perfect, but this bill does allow Treasury to buy toxic assets from financial institutions, including our small and community banks. Once these toxic assets are purchased, the Treasury should be encouraged to restructure loans that are in foreclosure. This is indeed encouraging news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are substantial improvements in the present version of the bill compared to the Bush administration proposal. However, the bill as it is presently written, in my view needs some clarification as to how it provides the necessary relief to middle-class America. There are provisions now that address accountability measures by requiring a plan to ensure the taxpayer is repaid in full, and requiring congressional review after the first $350 billion for future payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Principally, there are three phases of a financial rescue with strong taxpayer protections: reinvest, reimburse, and reform. One of the phases is to reinvest in the troubled financial markets to stabilize the markets. Another, reimburses the taxpayer and requires a plan to guarantee that they will be repaid in full. The last is to reform how business is done on Wall Street. The current legislation provides for fewer golden parachutes and, to its credit, provides sweeping congressional oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are critical improvements to the rescue plan that yield greater protection to the American taxpayers and even to Main Street. However, with the passage of this bill, it is my hope that <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> will help the financial markets and make America secured. I am cautious and hopeful that there is enough in the bill to help Americans struggling with their mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I have certain lingering concerns regarding this bill, I have voted for this bill. After meeting with an Assistant Secretary for the Treasury, some of my concerns were answered; others remained. For example, the Assistant Secretary indicated Treasury's intervention in the markets will afford it the opportunity to purchase toxic assets. After Treasury purchases these toxic assets at fair market value, it is expected that the purchase price will set a marker so that other similar classes  of assets will be purchased at the same or higher price level. This is a positive development for banks and financial institutions to recapitalize themselves. By itself this would be a help to commercial banks that desire to sell off their toxic assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my conversation with the Assistant Secretary, he indicated that as time goes on, Treasury will develop guidelines for identifying and helping troubled small and community  banks. It is intended that small and community banks and small, women, and minority-owned businesses will all be aided by this legislation. These latter institutions will be aided because it is expected that there will be more liquidity in the market available to these entities  and that more credit can be extended to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the Assistant Secretary indicated that under sections 109 and 110, that Treasury has every incentive to renegotiate the terms of troubled mortgages. Importantly, the Assistant Secretary indicated that not all homeowners who are facing mortgage foreclosure will be helped. The goal, however, is to help as many Americans as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have drafted a letter to Chairman Frank of Financial Services, and I have raised several questions to which I would like answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I have asked Chairman Frank that should something go wrong with this bailout, whether Congress can be called to reconvene at any time before or after the election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I have asked Chairman Frank to share the constitutional grant of authority that would prevent the Secretary of Treasury from having unfettered power so that there will be a balance between the interests of the banks and individual homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, I have asked Chairman Frank what members of Congress can expect in the 111th Congress regarding follow-up on this bill and the financial situation generally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, I have asked Chairman Frank to answer how members can ensure that community and regional banks can take advantage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are critical questions that need to be answered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that Wall Street is an important and vital part of the Nation's economy. I believe that the people who work there are good. It is a well known fact that financial markets do not always serve small businesses and minorities. I have personally had experiences where good hardworking people and small business owners were denied access to financial markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in America and I believe in its Constitution. I believe that this bill would allow constant monitoring and vigilance and would help the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of the Preamble to our Constitution, which reads:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to end with a quote from Alexander Hamilton: "the sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this legislation will provide the American people with the sun beam. It is my hope that this legislation works and that it serves the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we obviously have a crisis in the financial markets. Major firms have failed and others are failing. We are in an economic downturn with people losing their homes, businesses going under, and credit drying up for small businesses and consumers. The current crisis is the predictable consequence of the failed economic policies of the last 8 years. These policies are the ones that have produced record budget deficits, the worst job growth since the Great Depression--including  our ninth consecutive month of job losses--and the worst Dow performance in over three decades. Congress should address the crisis with appropriate legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate bill that we considered today is not fundamentally different from the bill we voted on Monday, although some have attempted to change the name of the package from a "bailout" to a "rescue." The foundation of the bill remained the outlay of $700 billion for the purchase of worthless assets. On balance, the final version of the bill was still not a good deal for taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether or not the bailout act we voted on today was a "good" deal rises and falls on the issue of fair value. You cannot rationally determine the worthiness of a purchase, without first assessing what the fair value is, and whether you are paying more or less than that fair value. If the bailout legislation included a provision that would provide that the Federal Government would pay no more than the good faith estimate of the fair value for the assets, then it would be a good deal. Some of  the assets we will be asked to buy are options, derivatives, and other exotic speculative investments that are in fact worthless. There is no public policy rationale to bail investors out of speculative securities that did not pay off. Since there is no commitment to calculating</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not suggesting that establishing a fair value of these assets will be easy. But there are well established factors in other situations to determine the value of assets when selling prices or bid and asked prices are not available. And it is our obligation as protectors of the U.S. Treasury to require that no funds should be spent without a reasonable assessment of what we are buying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore we should not give unlimited discretion to buy assets at prices obviously higher than fair value to an administration frequently accused of cronyism and favoritism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are dealing with three separate but inter-related problems: illiquidity in the credit market; insolvency of some financial institutions; and the hardship of homeowners. Offering fair value prices for assets will address the issue of liquidity. If we limited purchasing prices to fair value, we could purchase assets, reestablish confidence, wait for the markets to reinvigorate and the private sector could then buy assets back from the Government. Even if it took more than $700 billion, as long  as we were paying fair value, and receiving assets earning more than our borrowing costs, we could be confident that, in the long run, this solution would at least break even, and would likely make money for the taxpayer even if we held the assets to maturity. But since the bill provides no</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem with illiquidity which affects credit relates to lending institutions holding valuable but temporarily illiquid assets on their books. While there is no market for those assets, accounting regulators require the assets to be valued at virtually zero. Since lending authority is directly related to the institution's capital, this markdown significantly reduces lending authority, which leads to the credit crunch. This problem can be solved either by the government purchasing the assets  at fair value or by a change in accounting regulations to allow assets to be booked at "fair economic value" rather than "market value". This administrative change in the "mark to market" rule would significantly increase lending authority at no cost to the taxpayer. In addition there are a handful of banks that have sufficient capital but not enough deposits to sustain lending authority; in those few cases, simply depositing federal funds in the bank would increase lending capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another factor affecting credit is the reluctance that banks have to lend money to other banks; for fear that the other bank might go broke without notice as several recently have done. This problem can be cured by the issuance of "net worth certificates" which would guarantee the net worth of a bank, for a fee which would insure that there would be no net cost to the taxpayer. This has been done successfully in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other ways to instill confidence in financial institutions without spending any of the taxpayer's money. William Isaac, former head of the FDIC, has suggested that FDIC exercise the powers already granted to it by Congress. The FDIC can take emergency action and declare that no general creditor of a failed bank will suffer a loss if the bank fails. That declaration, when coming from the FDIC would, by statute, be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. This action  would be a signal to the worldwide market that the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind our banks, and an influx of capital would soon follow. Another FDIC change would be to increase the limit at which FDIC insures deposits from $100,000 to $250,000. This would limit the destabilizing impact of major withdrawals from banks. This provision is not controversial and is actually in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another factor which affects capital and therefore lending authority is the downward pressure on stock prices caused by short selling. Administrative action has already been taken to prohibit "naked short sales" and to restore the "uptick" rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the bill was defeated on Monday, I worked with other members who were skeptical of the bill, to propose cost-effective solutions to the crisis. Representative Peter DeFazio has produced a bill, the No BAILOUTS, Bringing Accounting, Increased Liquidity, Oversight and Upholding Taxpayer Security Act, that outlines administrative changes that could be implemented at no cost to the taxpayer. The bill directs the administration to implement a net worth certificates program, adjust mark  to market valuation rules, increase FDIC insurance limits, and regulate short sales. These no-cost changes would be more likely to have an impact on the domestic credit crunch than spending $700 billion purchasing worthless assets from all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some argue that overpaying for assets will help solve the second problem of the crisis,  the insolvency of some financial institutions, by providing capital to these institutions. I believe that we should help financially troubled companies that have a good chance of stabilizing and coming back with our help. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the bill to stop companies in no distress, or companies that are hopelessly insolvent, from selling their toxic  assets to the Government, and any overpayment for assets those companies sell will provide no value to the taxpayer. There are more efficient ways of targeting financial assistance to appropriate companies than making overpayments to all companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress does have an interest in assisting homeowners, but homeowners struggling to pay mortgages will find little comfort in this legislation. We should have included meaningful assistance for struggling homeowners in the bill. All homeowners would benefit because homeowners who are paying their mortgages on time have been hurt by home prices collapsing because of the flurry of foreclosures, and perspective homeowners are having difficulty finding new mortgages. The bill directs the Treasury  Secretary to implement a plan to decrease foreclosures, "to the extent that the Secretary acquires mortgages". The problem is that the toxic securities that the Treasury is being asked to buy are not individual mortgages, but options, derivatives and other securities</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many effective ways to actually help homeowners. In November 2007, Representative Joe Baca introduced <bill type="h" number="4135">H.R. 4135</bill>, the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, FFRC. Representative Baca's bill is based on the concept of the Home Owner's Loan Corporation, HOLC. During the Great Depression, this Government entity was created to buy troubled mortgages, and then refinance the mortgages at rates the homeowners could afford, preventing more foreclosures and stabilizing housing  prices. When HOLC ended operations in 1951, it had turned a profit to the taxpayer. <bill type="h" number="4135">H.R. 4135</bill> would create the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, FFRC, to refinance loans for people currently in foreclosure or in serious default. Families will be able to refinance their mortgage through a Government administered loan with a set interest rate. FFRC would assist homeowners paying on the mortgages that back many of the toxic assets the Treasury is being asked to buy. Providing stability in the mortgage market is a much more direct solution to the foreclosure problem than overpaying</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the major assessment of the core provisions of the bill rises and falls on the issues of fair price valuation and actual assistance to homeowners, there are other issues addressed in the legislation. The media has reported that there are provisions in this bill to limit executive compensation and to protect the taxpayer. The actual language in this bill does not support these reports. There are huge loopholes in the bill that allow companies to continue to pay executives exorbitant salaries.  And, the taxpayer protections in the bill are flimsy. If the bailout does not pay for itself, the bill leaves it to a future administration to propose a bill to tax financial institutions to raise the money taxpayers have lost. In a Congress where there</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failure of the bill to limit the purchase of any assets to the fair value of those assets means that the bill will not effectively address the underlying issues: purchasing worthless assets adds nothing to general liquidity; overpaying for assets from all companies is an inefficient way to help those companies who only need temporary assistance to survive; and overpaying for assets does nothing for homeowners. Furthermore, this bill will fail to instill confidence in the market when it becomes  apparent that the language of the bill is unlikely to match the public description of the bill on CEO compensation, foreclosure prevention and protection of the taxpayer. For those reasons, I regret that I was unable to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should have drafted a new bill with the inclusion of many of the alternative proposals I have laid out in this statement. The result would have been a comprehensive bipartisan bill which targets our Federal assistance to the goals we need to address: illiquidity in the market, solvency for appropriate businesses, and assistance to homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By spending $700 billion ineffectively on this crisis now, we will not have funds to respond to the next phase of our financial crisis in the future. For example, homeowners are continuing to lose their homes, and we have done very little to stem the tide of that problem. And because of today's vote, we will have fewer resources to address that problem in the future. Furthermore, we must not forget that the underlying problem is that we are in an economic downturn, and our actions must be deliberate  and measured if we are going to steer our way out of this mess. Unfortunately, we now have $700 billion less to address our economic situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many administration initiatives that require virtually no taxpayer money, which would have a huge impact on the banking crisis, the solvency of businesses, and the challenges of homeowners. We should have begun with proposing those no cost administrative changes, before we authorized the expenditure of $700 billion on a plan unlikely to make any difference at all.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents are angry and I am too that we let our economy get to this point. The speculation and greed of Wall Street in recent years--coupled with years of failures, excesses, arrogance, and irresponsibility of the regulatory agents, Treasury and other Cabinet Departments, the White House and even some in Congress--has resulted in the meltdown of our Nation's financial and credit markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many have passionately called for rejection of this compromise bill sent to us by the Senate following the rejection of the House bill earlier this week. There is a temptation for me to vote "no." We could teach a lesson to Wall Street highflyers. We could teach a lesson to Secretary Paulson, President Bush, and the regulatory agencies. We could teach a lesson to the mortgage companies who entice borrowers to get over their heads. We could teach the Senators a lesson not to attach extraneous  things to a financial bill. We could let the credit markets freeze up. We could let small businesses fail to meet next week's payroll. We could let college students drop out because they can't pay tuition. We could leave farmers, homeowners, and factories out in the cold. Would that teach the right lesson to the right people? I don't think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Market turmoil is affecting more than the 78,000 New Jerseyans who work on Wall Street and the 266,200 New Jerseyans who work in the financial services sector throughout the State. There are thousands of my constituents who are not traders or high powered executives but still work in impacted industries. If left unchecked the credit crisis will hurt all of New Jersey, painfully affecting New Jerseyans from factory to financial district from farm to pharma. Furthermore, millions of Americans who  have retired or are nearing retirement have seen their value of their pensions shrink. If day-to-day credit tightens up, Americans will not be able to get loans for college, cars, or a new furnace for the corner store. We need to act to ensure that retirement funds and pension plans are not devastated by investments that have lost value in a jittery market. Indeed we must</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is much that should have been done and must still be done fix the problems in federal financial oversight agencies. The Treasury Department should have exercised its authority to oversee the mortgage markets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, should have raised the insurance limit on deposits, which has not been raised for 28 years, and created a net worth certificate program similar to the one that helped shore up banks in the 1980s. The Securities and Exchange Commission,  SEC, should have</paragraph>
    <paragraph>prohibited short selling especially, naked short selling. It should have changed the mark-to-market rule that forces banks' assets to be valued not at their long term worth but at what they would be sold--if only they could be sold--for on market today. Alan Greenspan, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, should have followed the instructions of Congress in 1994 to regulate the mortgage market. Greenspan failed to act to institute oversight for years and years and when succeeding Chairman Bernanke  finally recognized the need to act it was years too late. Had the Treasury Department, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and SEC acted we would not be in this mess today. The  Democratic Congress has tried to set this right several times. However, we failed to convince the administration to do what was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After careful and thoughtful review, I support the bill before us today because this legislation will help to mitigate this financial crisis, restore confidence in our financial institutions, and bring much needed liquidity to our marketplace. This bill is not, as so many of my colleagues have said on the floor today, a bailout that will save the fat cats on Wall Street. Had we accepted Secretary Paulson's original proposal that is exactly what it would have been. If the President had his way,  he would have ridden a wave of fear and railroaded Congress into passing Secretary Paulson's original 3-page proposal asking for $700 billion--with no oversight--to bail out the financial services agencies. I did not support the original plan. The bill before us is a significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation includes protections to ensure that the taxpayers' money is not wasted. Only half of the authorized $700 billion would initially be available to the Treasury Department. A strict oversight board would be created to monitor how these funds are being used and the effect it has on the economy, and to advise the Secretary of the Treasury Department on how these funds are used. Congress and the President would have to approve the release of the next $350 billion if it is needed. This  legislation would require the Treasury Department to implement a plan to mitigate foreclosures and to encourage lenders to modify loans and mortgages to prevent foreclosures and keep people in their homes. The bill also helps save small businesses that need credit by allowing small community banks to deduct losses from investments in Fannie</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also extends a needed tax relief which, unless extended, would expire at the end of the year. It will provide a one year patch that will prevent 88,000 New Jerseyans from getting hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, this year. It will  retain and create half a million jobs and strengthen our economy by extending the renewable energy tax credits. It will extend essential tax cuts for American families helping 4.5 million Americans afford college by extending the tuition deduction, and extending the child tax credit. It will extend for 1 year my initiative that allows a property tax deduction for taxpayers who do not itemize on their tax returns of $500 for single filers and $1,000 deduction for joint filers. The legislation  helps American small businesses by extending the R&amp;D tax credit and the new markets tax credit. It will also require mental health parity in employer-based insurance and end discrimination against patients seeking treatment for mental illness, an initiative that I have been working on since I was elected to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not deny that there are provisions in this bill that do not belong. In fact, the provisions decreasing the excise tax on Puerto Rican rum as well as the decrease in the excise tax on wooden arrows are egregious. There should not be a tax deduction for movie and television producers. Nor should this legislation encourage the production of dirty fuels like coal to liquids and oil shale. I cannot justify these provisions, but I will not vote against teachers being able to get a tax deduction  for buying supplies for their students, against the solar tax credit which has helped New Jersey become one of the nation's leaders in solar energy production, or against incentives for businesses and individuals to donate items to schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can expect that <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> will help American families by loosening the credit market. However, if we do not address the origins of this problem we will be forced to come back again to address the symptoms. The root of this problem is that bad mortgages, when mixed with the good mortgages, have poisoned the financial papers. We need to help Americans saddled with these bad mortgages. It is estimated that a million currently solvent mortgages will turn toxic by next year and further destabilize  our financial institutions. It is our responsibility to prevent this from happening. Doing so would benefit the homeowners, the neighborhoods, the towns, and the investors in the financial district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest that we consider a model that has been proven to help the homeowner, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, HOLC. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation of the 1930's through the 1950's helped people with their mortgages. It was a Federal program that shored up a collapsing market and rescued a million homeowners. Incidentally, when it finally went out of business, it showed a net plus for the taxpayer. I will be introducing legislation which would create such a program. Indeed, that legislation  should have been used instead of the Paulson-Bush approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that Congress should come back into session after the November elections to pass such a bill and to take up an economic stimulus package that will help those suffering on Main Street. It is deeply concerning to me and infuriating to our constituents that as we have focused on the crisis on Wall Street we have not paid comparable attention to American families that have been struggling for months. The unemployment rate has been steadily increasing, reaching 6.1 percent this month, the  highest level since 1992. This year, 605,000 Americans have lost their jobs. Employed Americans are continuing to struggle with increasing energy and food costs and decreasing wages. Many are at risk of losing their pensions due to bad decisions made by Wall Street. We must deal with the bad mortgages. People want to punish those who behaved recklessly. There may be actual legal action. That may provide some satisfaction, but without today's bill it would not address the crisis of confidence, it would not help the people who are about to be hurt financially. We must deal with</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I oppose <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> today because it does not address the real problems that caused this current financial crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I voted against the financial bailout legislation that failed on Monday, with the hope that Congress could then work on different ideas for how to solve this problem. Instead, we have been given nearly the exact same proposal, with little modification, but with a much larger price tag. Although I support taking action to help correct the damage done to our markets, I believe that making the wrong choice today places a risky and heavy burden on American taxpayers. Today's legislation  does not provide adequate assistance to homeowners, does not provide assistance to communities with large quantities of foreclosures, and does not prohibit the predatory lending practices that got us into the current crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve have both indicated that this may not work. Further, there is no backup plan if this proposal does not work. When discussing this bailout, it is important that people keep in mind that agreeing to the $700 billion price tag could be only the beginning. This bailout would transfer billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities to the federal government and provide no roadmap for what comes next. If these properties  are foreclosed, the federal government is not prepared to become the Nation's largest homeowner without seriously considering how it will handle these mortgaged properties. If the Federal Government takes possession of these mortgages, questions like "who will replace the roofs and windows," will abound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have introduced <bill type="h" number="7113">H.R. 7113</bill>, the Preserve our Neighborhoods Act, a bill which would allow communities who have been hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis to purchase the mortgages acquired by the Treasury during the course of the bailout. This would allow these local governments to take abandoned, blighted properties, and redevelop them for more productive use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally Madam Speaker, I have joined my Ohio colleague Congressman Steve LaTourette in attempting to amend the current package to reduce the amount of the initial bailout payment, and increase Congress's role in allocating additional funds. Both of these provisions would provide some commonsense reforms to this bill--these provisions would add accountability to the bailout  payment, and address a real problem that's facing local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Representing Ohio's Statement <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> Concurring to the Senate A Speaker,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But sadly Madam Speaker, these reforms are not a part of this package. Instead, we have essentially the same package we had before, only with tax credits and earmark spending. Any legislation that we bring forward should hold the right people accountable and prohibit the bad lending actions that led to this crisis. Today's bill fails in this respect and therefore leaves us vulnerable to the same situation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am in favor of the tax extenders and have voted in favor of mental health parity, both of which are included in the current package, the underlying problem still remains: how does the federal government address the foreclosures that have led to this mess. Something should be done Madam Speaker. Something should be done to fix this problem. Unfortunately, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> is not the solution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, only in Washington could a bill demonstrably worse than its predecessor be brought back for another vote and actually expect to gain votes. That this bailout was initially defeated was a welcome surprise, but the power-brokers in Washington and on Wall Street could not allow that defeat to be permanent. It was most unfortunate that this monstrosity of a bill, loaded up with even more pork, was able to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Reserve has already injected hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. and world credit markets. The adjusted monetary base is up sharply, bank reserves have exploded, and the national debt is up almost half a trillion dollars over the past two weeks. Yet, we are still told that after all this intervention, all this inflation, that we still need an additional $700 billion bailout, otherwise the credit markets will seize and the economy will collapse. This is the same excuse that preceded  previous bailouts, and undoubtedly we will hear it again in the future after this bailout fails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most dangerous effects of this bailout is the incredibly elevated risk of moral hazard in the future. The worst performing financial services firms, even those who have been taken over by the Government or have filed for bankruptcy, will find all of their poor decision-making rewarded. What incentive do Wall Street firms or any other large concerns have to make sound financial decisions, now that they see the Federal Government bailing out private companies to the tune of trillions  of dollars? As Congress did with the legislation authorizing the Fannie and Freddie bailout, it proposes a solution that exacerbates and encourages the problematic behavior that led to this crisis in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With deposit insurance increasing to $250,000 and banks able to set their reserves to zero, we will undoubtedly see future increases in unsound lending. No one in our society seems to understand that wealth is not created by government fiat, is not created by banks, and is not created through the manipulation of interest rates and provision of easy credit. A debt-based society cannot prosper and is doomed to fail, as debts must either be defaulted on or repaid, neither resolution of which presents  this country with a pleasant view of the future. True wealth can only come about through savings, the deferral of present consumption in order to provide for a higher level of future consumption. Instead, our Government through its own behavior and through its policies encourages us to live beyond our means, reducing existing capital and mortgaging our future to pay for present consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The money for this bailout does not just materialize out of thin air. The entire burden will be borne by the taxpayers, not now, because that is politically unacceptable, but in the future. This bailout will be paid for through the issuance of debt which we can only hope will be purchased by foreign creditors. The interest payments on that debt, which already take up a sizeable portion of Federal expenditures, will rise, and our children and grandchildren will be burdened with increased taxes  in order to pay that increased debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As usual, Congress has shown itself to be reactive rather than proactive. For years, many people have been warning about the housing bubble and the inevitable bust. Congress ignored the impending storm, and responded to this crisis with a poorly thought-out piece of legislation that will only further harm the economy. We ought to be ashamed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. On Monday, the House failed to pass a rescue package, and the stock market dropped 777 points--the biggest one day point drop in US. history. The impact of that drop wasn't just felt on Wall Street; it was also felt on Main Street. On Monday alone, Americans lost $1.2 trillion in the stock market. Almost 50 percent of Americans are invested in the stock market in some way, whether  through retirement accounts or private investments, and they rely on credit and their investments to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is about protecting people's retirement accounts and pension plans. In the last year, investments have declined by nearly 24 percent, putting the retirement security of millions at risk; I am worried that without this package, they will continue to the downward spiral. This legislation is about making sure that there is enough credit in order for students and families to take out loans to afford to go to college. It is about letting businesses make their payroll. It is about  helping people stay in their homes. That is why dozens of groups representing educators, colleges, the homeless, pension managers, and others support this legislation,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it very clear that I think this legislation is far from perfect--and, like many of my colleagues, I would have written a very different bill. However, I believe that Monday demonstrated that we had to act. Years of harmful Republican policies that pushed for deregulation and tolerated an almost total lack of enforcement, and a misguided philosophy that insisted that an unregulated market can heal all ills, have now led us to the brink of economic collapse. And I am deeply concerned--and  hundreds of economists agree--that the failure to act could lead to a major economic depression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the rescue plan, while still imperfect, has come a long way from where we began. Instead of giving the President $700 billion with virtually no oversight or safeguards, we require Congressional review after the first $350 billion. And this legislation requires equity sharing, so taxpayers would benefit from future growth in the investments they have bought, and it requires Wall Street to pay back any losses to the Government. We are stopping forms of executive compensation that would encourage  executives to take excessive risks, eliminating golden parachutes for executives who take part in the Government program, and cracking down on excessive compensation practices for the first time in history. And we include strong, independent oversight to protect the taxpayer, including two oversight boards to ensure that the Treasury Secretary is acting on good faith, as well as judicial review over the Secretary's actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I would have liked to see the tax provisions paid for by rolling back some of the President's tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes, there are also important tax fixes that will benefit millions of Americans and small businesses across the country. The legislation provides property tax relief to up to 30 million homeowners--extending a new $1,000 property tax deduction for non-itemizing couples through the end of 2009. It extends the qualified tuition deduction  for low- and middle-income Americans. It extends the child tax credit, which will benefit millions of Americans with children age 17 and younger. It extends the Research and Development tax credit, which spurs innovation and job growth in the technology sector. And it extends critical renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits to help the green economy take shape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also contains critical, comprehensive mental health parity legislation that will bring mental health insurance benefits in line with physical benefits. I have not held a health care meeting in my district without the issue of access to mental health care being brought up by my constituents who have faced discrimination or difficulty obtaining affordable care. I am proud that we are continuing Senator Paul Wellstone's legacy by passing a bill that guarantees equal access to mental  health and substance abuse treatment. I also want to thank Representatives Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad for their persistence and passion in passing the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is so much more we should do. I am strongly committed to enacting a second stimulus package that will truly benefit the American people. Today the House enacted 7 weeks of extended benefits for workers who have exhausted regular unemployment compensation, with workers in high unemployment states eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits. However, I believe we also need to make investments in our highways, bridges, transit systems, and schools; we need increases in food stamps benefits;  and we need a crucial temporary increase in Medicaid payments to States. Studies have shown that those are some of the quickest forms of economic stimulus because those benefits and investments are spent quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill represents unfinished business. I will fight my hardest to make sure that we rein in the excesses of corporate America in the next Congress, and to see to it that this crisis does not happen again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at the end of the day, I was sent to Congress in November 1994 because the people of the 4th congressional district of Kansas believed in the message of less Government spending, personal and corporate responsibility and lower taxes. Therefore, I remain committed to those who  sent me here and opposed to the unprecedented power that would be given to the Federal Government through this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Treasury Secretary came to Congress with a message: he needed $700 billion and he needed it now. I understand the need to act and the need to act quickly. At that time, however, I stood with my Republican colleagues and opposed the hasty call for an unprecedented blank check to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the weekend, Congress negotiated with the Secretary to work out a better proposal through several non-government based approaches. Some of the provisions I could support but the fact remains that a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street is too much for our taxpayers to bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, I joined with a majority of my Republican and Democrat colleagues to defeat this short-sighted fix that exposed Americans everywhere to long-term debt that could lead to an even greater financial crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not wanting to be outdone, the Senate quietly inserted over a billion dollars worth of pork: $148 million for wool fabric producers, $2 million for the makers of wooden arrows for children, and a $100 million tax break to benefit NASCAR racetracks. Even Hollywood got a tax break gift worth nearly half a billion dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was a three-page idea had grown in a week to more than 450 pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What it comes down to is that a $700 or $800 billion bailout with voluntary reforms was not a plan I could support. Worse yet, Sec. 112 of the Senate bill, allows foreign financial institutions who hold troubled assets as a result of extending financing to financial institutions that have failed or defaulted on such financing to participate in this massive Government bail-out. What does this mean? Simply, the Federal Government has invited foreign financiers to participate in this bailout on  behalf of every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, my decision today to oppose the Senate bill does not come easily. Many of us lost savings. Many employers expressed concerns about access to credit so they could make payroll for their workers. I heard from hard-working Kansans who were concerned about a downsized economy that could force them out of a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A quick bailout fix might work for a short time, but it may not be long before we are asked again for more tax dollars. This is evidenced by recent Government bailouts of Bear Stearns, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, AIG, and the $25 billion tossed to the auto industry. A quick bailout fix might work for the short term, but without addressing the underlying problems, we will be asked again for more tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An economic rescue plan needs to include reforms that tie mortgage broker's commissions to borrowers' timely payments; a mandatory FDIC-type insurance program for entities with troubled mortgages; a suspension of "mark to market" accounting procedures; a temporarily suspension of capital gains taxes; and a permanent, not a temporary increase on FDIC coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 coupled with an increase in premiums so that the statutory obligation of 1.15 percent is met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mandatory FDIC-type insurance program would require the Treasury Department to guarantee (losses up to 100%) resulting from the failure of timely payment and interest from mortgage backed securities originated prior to the date of the enactment. Such insurance, I believe, would provide immediate value to the securities and a foundation for which they could then be sold. I am disappointed this provision was not included as a mandatory program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, instead of a Government-driven bailout, I support an alternative where the Government enables and coordinates a greater involvement of private investors. An alternative could be to allow companies to carry-back losses arising in tax years ending in 2007, 2008, or 2009 back 5 years, generating a tax refund and immediate capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few alternative provisions that I believe would be better than merely throwing money at a problem we hope to fix. I want Kansans to go to bed tonight with peace of mind and not worry about their savings. I am ready for this financial turmoil to calm and for us to focus on other important things in our lives. But I could not support a $700 or $800 billion bailout plan that embraces temporary relief while shunning long-term reform that brings lasting stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remain committed to working for a long-term solution with Democrats and Republicans who are willing to put the good of our country ahead of short-term fixes. It's the right thing to do.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have all heard from thousands of our constituents on this measure over the past two weeks. I spoke to one constituent of mine from Iowa yesterday who contacts me regularly to express her opinions and ideas. When discussing her opposition to this bill she summed up the frustrations of Iowans and the overwhelming majority of people across this country. She said "the people out here in the heartland see this bill and bailout as a result of Washington talking to Washington--and  not talking and listening to the real people beyond the beltway."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She hit the nail on the head. This measure today is a true result of Washington talking to Washington, of Congressional partisanship blinding the legislative process and blocking the chance for real common sense comprehensive solutions, and members of an administration that are quicker to respond to the needs and pain of Wall Street than the needs and reality on Main Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure we voted on Monday was based almost exactly on the original plan of one man--that of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. This plan was sold to us with no guarantee of success--even from its author. This plan was created and based on a randomly selected price tag of $700 billion to the American taxpayers. When asked about why that number was chosen, a spokesperson for the Treasury Department responded in a news article last week that they came up with it because they wanted "a really  large number."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the question has to be asked of this plan--is it morally right to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to reward and benefit those on Wall Street who were knowingly involved in risky and, sometimes, exotic financial investments that were hidden from the eyes of Federal regulators?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is Washington so quick to focus on the needs of Wall Street at the cost of those responsible Iowans who have sacrificed, saved, and spent within their means?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No wonder real America has lost faith in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted against almost this same measure on Monday afternoon. It was a tough vote but it was the right vote. I took that vote so we could sit down as Americans who are truly interested in the well-being of all people in this Nation to find a more acceptable path--a well thought out common-sense path. After all, we do agree that something must be done to try and save this Nation and her people for what would be a devastating period of economic disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hopes, and the hopes of the majority in this country, were dashed after the U.S. Senate not only embraced the plan we voted down earlier in the House, but added an even larger price tag on American taxpayers. And, the Senate--as only could be done in Washington--added hundreds of millions of dollars in pork to the bill to fund children's wooden arrows, race tracks and Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands rum. The Senate turned a deaf ear to the cries of the American people who are opposed to this  measure and decided to add even more unwanted items to their tab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of full disclosure the Senate did add items that I fully support. Important provisions that could help Iowa's renewables industry--in wind, solar and biofuels--that could help Iowans who are struggling to rebuild after the devastating floods of this summer, and other common sense measures that include increasing FDIC insurance limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the foundation of the Senate bill that we are considering today remains the same--the randomly selected $700 billion plan that was the creation of one man, that empowers that one man to spend the money as he sees fit--yet has no guarantees for success or even realistic protection provisions that will close the taxpayer's check book if the plan is not working. I could never trust anyone person with complete discretion of $700 billion of taxpayer's money--no strings attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the members of this body know, I joined with a group of my colleagues yesterday to work to provide Washington with one last option other than the plan of based on a randomly selected number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We drafted an amendment that would give Secretary Paulson $250 billion to use as proposed in his original plan. Even he has said that he could only spend at the most $50 billion a month. This gives him at least five months to see if his plan is working, and if it is proving to have success for all of America's economy, then he can return to Congress to request the remaining funds. While I know even $250 billion is unacceptable to many fiscal conservatives, the plan gave the American people some  level of control over their tax dollars to know that a plan based on a randomly selected number would have to show success and benefits to main street before it was permitted to move forward beyond that additional smaller price tag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment also gave us time--time to come back here and discuss alternatives for the good of the nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this amendment would have received overwhelming bi-partisan support from the rank-and-file members whose voices were shut out of this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, what has become standard operating procedure for a broken Congress, in a broken Washington, the members of this body--representing the hundreds of millions of people in real America--were not even allowed the opportunity to vote on an alternate  plan. Instead we are forced to consider--up or down, no committee hearings, no committee votes--this plan based on a randomly selected number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week I have spoken with and listened to the reality of the economic landscape from small business employers throughout Iowa. I have heard from farmers, from colleges, from community governments, realtors, car dealerships, utility companies, and hometown bankers--employers of hundreds of thousands of Iowans. They all have told me of the reality of their experiences with credit markets, the reality of economic turbulence, and the real fears that if nothing is done soon that Iowa is facing  economic disaster like most of us have not seen in our lifetime. These are real people from real town America, who are doing the right things, providing good jobs for good people, who are leaders in their community and staples of the local economies who are suffering and face economic disaster not because of decisions they have made, but because of the decisions made on Wall Street and in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to all of us that action is needed to protect our economy. But is this plan really the right action we should take? After all, supporting this bill just for the sake that we agree that action is needed does not guarantee that we are moving in the right direction. And, for those who are suffering in real America, actions we take now that are not fully debated and discussed could end up causing more economic harm over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The events of the past two weeks--and the resulting proposal that we are forced to consider today--make it painfully clear to me, and millions of Americans, that Washington is unwilling, or incapable, of listening to anyone but Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I must stand on principle once again today and vote against this measure with the hope that Washington will wake up and--immediately following this vote--begin the responsible process of working together, working with the American people to find a solution that is well considered based on fundamental economic principles that addresses the real needs of real America--real main street. These are the principles on which our Nation was founded and these are the principles that we have  the duty as Americans to stand up and protect.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the choice before us today is not between action and inaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a false choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly there is a very serious economic challenge. The decision before us is whether to adopt a potential $700 billion taxpayer liability to nationalize bad corporate debt or an alternative that may be less costly, easier to implement, and fairer to most Americans who have no blame for this mess.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with significant reluctance and reticence that I will vote yes, on final passage, of the Economic Recovery Act. In the State of Michigan, which is facing record high unemployment, failure of businesses, and increasingly tighter credit markets, we must do something, right now, to ensure that the citizens, businesses, and organizations of the city of Detroit, the State of Michigan and the United States of America survive. This is not a perfect bill. I would  have preferred that Congress explore other options, most of which did not involve a single dime from taxpayers, as was utilized during the savings and loan crisis, in a more deliberate manner. The provisions in the bill that "recommend" and "suggest" that the Secretary of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My yes vote, and it is perhaps one of the most difficult votes I have made in my 30 years as a public servant, is a reflection of the fact that if Congress does not do something soon, we possibly face an economic Armageddon the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression. Since I voted against the first version of this bill, the stock market has dropped a net of over 500 points and over one trillion dollars in total value. Our labor market has lost over 200,000 jobs in the month  of September. Inflation has risen to new highs. My office has been besieged with phone calls from hundreds of small- and medium-sized businesses that cannot purchase goods or services or meet their payroll because they cannot access their lines of credit. Parents in Michigan are concerned that they cannot secure student loans for their children. This inevitably hurts all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution of the United States, to which each and every Member of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate, takes an oath to protect and defend at the beginning of each 2-year session of Congress. Article I, Section 9, clause seven, of the U.S. Constitution says "no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law." The Constitution also establishes three separate and distinct branches of government: the legislative, judicial and executive  branches. As an Appropriator and for our U.S. House of Representatives, I oppose this bill's unprecedented and unparalleled secession of the power granted to us by the people and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the Constitution transferred to one appointed person from the executive branch of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Households in Detroit, the State of Michigan, and America feel the rumblings of the financial earthquake beneath their feet. Unemployment has risen to all-time highs. Michigan is one of the leading States in unemployment, home foreclosures as well as business losses. The sudden, precipitous and dramatic slump in home values, retirement accounts and pensions is a prelude to worse things to come. I have fielded dozens of phone calls from businesses in my district from small convenience stores and  automobile dealerships, to large corporations that are unable to access credit lines to make their payrolls. Without swift, immediate, and strong fiscal action and direction, America and Americans are in dire trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it is impossible for parents to get student loans for their children attending college. It is virtually impossible to get a mortgage with a rate that is reasonable. It is hard to find a decent, paying job. Again, it is tough for businesses to get loans to purchase those goods, items, and services that mean the difference between surviving and thriving, or even making their payroll. We have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in America this decade. This bill is not a cure-all, by any means.  However, it is a start to stop the bleeding from which so many of our citizens and businesses suffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does contain several provisions for which I fought and support. The bill will immediately increase the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's, FDIC, limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which will increase confidence citizens have in our banking system and prevent bank runs. The home foreclosure provision allows the Secretary, at his discretion, to lower the interest rate and, in some cases, the principal of home mortgages, ensuring that more citizens will stay in their homes and not on  the streets this winter. This bill will provide property tax relief to up to 30 million homeowners--extending a new $1,000 property tax deduction for non-itemizing couples through the end of 2009. Finally, the bill provides that minority- and women-owned businesses,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A key aspect of this bill that will become law is mental health parity for all Americans. Regrettably, too many private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses than for other medical conditions. Many insurers believe that mental health disorders are tough to diagnose, and that care for mental illness is ineffective, expensive and simply not worth the money. Thanks to this bill, all Americans will have access to mental health care. When mental health care is a part of  our general health care, there is often little or no increase in cost to insurers. This is a most important aspect of the bill and is an aspect of which we all can be proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these provisions are not as strong as I would like, my opposition to the overall bill, or to these provisions, is not strong enough to risk the enormous battering that continues to hammer our families and our economic system. The economic consequences of inaction are such that the citizens and businesses of our State and our Nation might not survive. That is a risk that I refuse to take. I will continue to fight for even stronger rules and regulations as we work in the wake of this bill,  under a new Democratic President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the faith of God, with the support of the people of Michigan, and with the guidance and leadership of my ancestors, I will continue to work and fight to ensure that American families will be able to stay in their homes; that businesses will come back even stronger and employ, engage and ensure that more people have decent, fair paying jobs; and that Detroit and Michigan will rise to the heights that once  made it, and America, the world's manufacturing  powerhouse. My support of this bill is a beginning step in that direction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Wednesday night, before returning to Washington, I had a telephone townhall in my district with over 5500 constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm here to report that they are angry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are angry that the Government allowed Wall Street mega-banks and manipulators to act so irresponsibly that they have led our economy to the brink of disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are angry that for over a decade, greed and abuse have been considered higher virtues than oversight and regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm angry, too. Because of the mess we're in, school districts back home have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in their reserve accounts. A San Bruno man who worked for 30 years at United Airlines is seeing his pension dissolve before his eyes. And Tony, an independent businessman from San Carlos, will likely have to close his remodeling business if he is unable to get short-term credit for supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we hear that the State of California may have to declare bankruptcy. These reasons are why I will vote for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Madam Speaker, no one should interpret this vote as approval of the situation we find ourselves in.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I do not support this economic recovery bill. While it is imperative that Congress act to address this financial crisis, this mixed bag of legislation is not the appropriate immediate or long-term solution. The hard work done by the Democratic leadership over the past week has made it better, but it's still not good enough. It doesn't go far enough to protect taxpayers or to help homeowners stay in their homes. I have been very vocal on the floor of the House of  Representatives about my concerns that this proposal won't help our financial situation and may be beside the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some extremely important provisions in the bill for which I have fought during the past 2 years. For example, the bill extends the production tax credit for wind energy and investment tax credit for solar energy. It includes legislation I drafted to provide a tax credit for the purchase of small wind turbines. And it provides tax fairness so employers can offer the same transportation fringe benefits for bicyclists that they offer to employees who commute by car and public transit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased that this bill will reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program, which is so important to Oregon. I'm pleased that it will prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax from impacting millions of hard-working, middle class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bad news is that, at a time when our national debt is at its highest point in over 50 years as a percentage of GDP, Senate Republicans chose not pay for most of the good things in this bill. I'm disappointed that the Senate also added a number of provisions to the bill that will provide incentives for coal-to-liquids and oil-shale fuels, which take us in the wrong direction in our battle against climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this bill works to protect our commercial system, but I fear that it won't. I will continue to fight to deal with the consequences of added debt and poor energy investment choices. I look forward to closely scrutinizing the choices that the Treasury Department makes as a result of this legislation and working to improve the position of ordinary homeowners, American taxpayers, and our environment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R.1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is little debate that there is a real crisis in our financial markets, and I share the sense of urgency felt by my colleagues as we look to bring stability to the financial sector and ensure the availability of credit to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had hoped that when a new bill came to the House, it would be a comprehensive package that would include greater accountability from Wall Street, greater protections for Americans on the verge of losing their homes, and an economic stimulus package that would create jobs to strengthen our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate did include important and beneficial provisions. I strongly support the addition of an increase in the FDIC's insurance cap to $250,000 and favor many of the included tax provisions such as renewable energy and research and development tax credits. In addition, I have consistently advocated for the mental health parity legislation that was the vehicle for this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, despite these commendable additions, I must remain opposed to the underlying plan of committing $700 billion of taxpayer dollars to an untested plan with an uncertain outcome and inadequate regulations and oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the bill begins to address the foreclosure crisis, its provisions are far from what many economists believe is needed to have a consequential impact on the American families who are losing their homes. To truly help stop the bleeding, I believe we must get at the root of the problem by including measures such as lifting the ban on loan modifications for primary residences during bankruptcy proceedings. This would enable homeowners to stay in their homes by renegotiating their loans. Preventing  foreclosures will protect families, communities, and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned that while the measure creates a congressional oversight panel, the panel lacks teeth and can only make non-binding recommendations. If the taxpayers are expected to stomach a $700 billion bailout, we have to insist on greater oversight authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill is simply a temporary bandage if it does not include economic stimulus provisions that will create the jobs needed to strengthen our economy and improve the financial condition of the average American. While the problems on Wall Street have reached a breaking point, ordinary Americans have been feeling the pain of weakness in the economy for a very long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this legislation passes it is simply a stop gap measure. I am heartened by the comments of Chairman Frank who committed to reforming our financial regulatory and oversight system and by Speaker Pelosi promise that we will come back and consider stimulus proposals that will truly help grow our economy and positively impact those who have been hurt by this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while I agree that inaction is not an option, I also believe we can, and must, do better than this legislation. I urge a no vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when the House responded to the economic crisis facing our country and considered a financial rescue plan this past Monday, September 29, the vote failed 205-228. Because of my deep belief that Congress must take action to restore the confidence and stability in the Nation's financial system and keep credit flowing to the people of Virginia and to households across the country, I voted for that legislative package and enclose for the RECORD my statement that day  explaining my vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have never been more concerned about the financial future of our country. Following the results of the House vote, there was a record 1-day point drop in the stock market that wiped out $1.2 trillion in wealth that average folks have tied up in retirement accounts, pension funds, and college savings. While there was a short-lived rebound on Tuesday, the market has continued on a downward spiral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The latest unemployment figures announced today showed that the economy shed 159,000 jobs in September, the steepest drop in 5 years and the ninth straight monthly decline. Also that day, world stocks fell to a new 3-year low. This news, combined with reports this week that U.S. auto sales fell in September by 27 percent from a year ago, points to a worrisome sign that credit is tightening and the economy is hurtling toward a deep recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we don't deal with this financial crisis now, foreign governments like China and Saudi Arabia, who already hold a significant portion of our debt, are waiting in the wings to buy up even more of America. We cannot allow China--a country that persecutes its own people because of their faith--or Saudi Arabia--which breeds the kind of radical ideology that led to the terrorist attacks on our country--to own what generations of Americans have worked so hard to build for their children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the House's failed vote, the Senate worked to revise the bipartisan package. The new bill includes the base of the economic rescue plan voted on in the House plus additional taxpayer protection and tax relief provisions and was passed by the Senate 74-25 on Wednesday. Because I continue to believe that this Congress must act to restore confidence in our economy, I will vote today for this amended measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revised bill has significant new safeguards for taxpayers and important tax relief provisions that will increase the amount of bank deposits insured by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 through 2009, to help stop a run on banks; protect 21 million working, middle-class families from getting hit with an average tax hike of $2,500 from the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, for tax year 2008; extend critical energy tax credits and incentives to encourage conservation and the development of renewable  energy technologies such as wind and solar power; extend tax deductions on State and local sales taxes and out-of-pocket expenses for teachers; expand the income threshold used to calculate the refundable portion of the child tax credit; extend a property tax deduction to homeowners who don't itemize, and provide tax relief for those in areas hit by recent natural disasters including hurricanes and floods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As in the original legislation, the revised measure authorizes up to $700 billion for a troubled assets relief program for the Treasury secretary to buy mortgages and other assets that are clogging the balance sheets of financial institutions and making it difficult for working families, small businesses, and other companies to access credit. While the legislation gives the Treasury secretary an immediate $250 billion for the program, it requires the president to certify that additional funds  are needed, $100 billion, then $350 billion subject to congressional disapproval. The assets acquired by the Treasury will eventually be sold. Many economists believe that if they are purchased at appropriate discounts, it is fair to say that the Treasury will recoup the taxpayers' investment or could even turn a profit over the long-run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure also provides strong watchdog authority over the Treasury through an oversight board and a special inspector general to protect against waste, fraud and abuse. The bill also ensures that irresponsible corporate executives at institutions participating in the Treasury program will not be rewarded with multi-million dollar "golden parachutes" or severance pay. The FBI continues to pursue corporate fraud investigations related to lenders, brokers, and appraisers involved in the mortgage  and sub-prime loan crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the concerns raised about the response to the financial crisis our country is facing. This package, including some provisions added by the Senate, is certainly not perfect. But I can't pick and choose from the parts. As I said in my statement after the House's initial vote, credit is the lifeline of our economy. Overall I believe this plan is vital to protect the long-term economic future of our country and to ensure that people in my congressional district as well as folks across  America are able to keep their jobs, get a home loan or car loan or a student loan to send their kids to college, and protect their savings and the value in their retirement accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always worked for the best interest of the taxpayers and residents of the 10th District which I represent. I am voting for this package because in good conscience I cannot stand by and watch the financial futures of the people across America tumble toward ruin not seen since the Great Depression. I believe this vote is the right thing to do at this time for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are understandably angry that our Nation's financial condition has reached this point and I understand the worry that has brought. I'm angry and worried, too, and share the concerns of the scores of people from the 10th District who contacted me in recent days. I understand when folks say they don't want to "bail out" Wall Street when they see the greed and irresponsibility we've witnessed from some in the financial system gambling with other people's money and losing. Experts  say that the root of the current financial crisis can be traced to the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage industry and the impact of high-risk loans on the Nation's housing industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree and also share the concern about reports that some CEOs on Wall Street and top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--which are now in Federal conservatorship--have gotten sweetheart deals and bonuses in the millions of dollars. That kind of action must not be rewarded and that's why I applauded the news that the FBI as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched investigations into potential criminal cases against firms accused of contributing  to the market collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I'm more worried about the people of Virginia and across America if we don't respond to the collapse in the credit markets in our country. We face a financial crisis and threat to the U.S. economy the proportions of which many say we haven't seen since the economic collapse of the Great Depression. For the past few weeks, the news has been filled with reports of some of the most prominent financial institutions in our country in free fall. Just this Monday, Wachovia, one of the largest banks  in Virginia and perhaps a bank you or your family or neighbors use, was sold, and more banks are expected to fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to credit is the lifeline of our economy. I'm worried that if we don't take the necessary action to shore up the Nation's credit system it will be the mom and dad in Herndon who won't be able to get a student loan to send their kids to college or buy a new house, or the young college graduate in Leesburg who won't be able to get a loan to buy a first car, or the older couple in Winchester nearing retirement whose nest egg in a 401(k) account is losing value, or the mom and pop store around  the corner in Front Royal that can't get the loan to make payroll, or the family in Manassas who need to sell their house but watch as home values drop and the prospective buyer can't get a home loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this crisis calls for extraordinary action. Some say without action millions of jobs could be lost. I believe the legislative package before Congress was mis-named as a "bailout." It is important to understand that it was a depression prevention plan to help restore confidence in and stabilize our country's credit system and ultimately the American economy. No legislation is ever perfect and there will be people of good will who disagree. But in tough times, it is the responsibility  of lawmakers to act and make tough choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted for this legislation today because I believe it was the right thing to do to begin the process of resolving this crisis and setting the country's financial institutions on sound footing. This legislation was a bipartisan compromise dramatically changed and improved from the original proposal and forged after tough negotiations between both political parties and the call that the measure must first and foremost protect taxpayers' investment and have transparency, accountability and oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package fulfilled those goals by:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing the Treasury secretary with authority to buy troubled assets currently held by financial institutions, but cut in half Secretary Paulson's original proposal of $700 billion in up-front, immediate authority. The plan would allow $250 billion in immediate authority, with another $100 billion available after the Secretary reports to Congress, and providing Congress with the authority to withhold the remaining $350 billion, assuring that economic assistance will be financed by Wall Street,  not Main Street. Many economists predict that ultimately taxpayers will see all their investment fully recouped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing transparency and oversight through establishment of a bipartisan oversight commission, split evenly between minority and majority; reporting requirements to ensure proper reports to Congress and the public; a special inspector general; a financial stability oversight board; strict conflict of interest and unjust enrichment rules, providing that if after 5 years the Government has a net loss of taxpayer funds as a consequence of the purchase program, the president will be required to  submit a legislative proposal to recoup such funds from program beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting taxpayers--not shareholders and not corporate executives--against loss by placing taxpayers first in line to recoup losses from participating financial institutions in the event they fail or lose money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prohibiting executive compensation or golden parachutes to ensure bad actors on Wall Street are not rewarded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring the establishment of an insurance guarantee program that in lieu of purchasing assets with taxpayer funds is available to insure assets at no cost to the taxpayer. Costs would be fully paid for by participating companies, i.e., those receiving the assistance. Assets insured by the program would count against the total funds the Treasury secretary would otherwise have available to make purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In considering this package I had to answer this question: What is the consequence of doing nothing to help stop the hemorrhaging of the Nation's credit system, and even the broader consequence of a potential worldwide depression? I had to decide what is in the best interest of our country and the taxpayers and residents of this congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When faced with that decision, I cast my vote for the legislative package. I was disappointed that the bill failed passage by a vote of 205-228 and that a majority of my House colleagues both Democrat and Republican did not recognize the need to shore up our financial system and restore the flow of credit to help protect Main Street America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just minutes after the final vote, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped over 700 points and closed for the day down 778 points, the largest one-day point drop in history. The broadest measure of the American stock market, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, fell 8.77 percent, its biggest drop since October 1987. The failure to approve the legislation resulted in uncertainty and turmoil in the markets, eroding billions of dollars in individual savings and household wealth. In a few hours,  an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets lost their value--that is people's retirement accounts, pension funds, and college savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the failure of the legislation, it is uncertain what the next step will be, but the crisis in the financial markets continues, and congressional leaders have pledged to go back to work and negotiate a bipartisan solution to restore confidence in the markets and come back to the House for another vote. No matter what final legislation is enacted to help stem the current crisis, I believe Congress has lots of work to do in the future to reform financial market regulation so that our country  is not faced with this kind of crisis in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crisis in the credit markets, however, may be a symptom of a greater financial crisis on the horizon. We must come to grips with the national debt which is approaching $11 trillion. Then we must focus on the over $53 trillion in unfunded and unsustainable entitlement obligations we face as well as uncontrolled  Federal spending. The statistics are staggering and real. Standard and Poor's Investment Service has indicated that the United States could  lose its triple-A bond rating as early as 2012 if we do not take action to reverse course. By not dealing with this issue we are enabling foreign governments like China and Saudi Arabia to buy America. That is bad for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I introduced the SAFE Commission Act, <bill type="h" number="3654">H.R. 3654</bill>, with Democrat Rep. JIM COOPER of Tennessee to set up a national bipartisan commission to put everything on the table and recommend to Congress a way to put our country on sound financial footing. The legislation requires an up-or-down vote by Congress. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call said in an editorial that the SAFE Commission should be part of the discussion of any response to the financial markets crisis. Other newspapers  and organizations across the political spectrum have agreed that the SAFE plan can be the way forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>P.S. I have based my service in Congress on the principles of honesty and integrity and doing what I believe is best for the people of this congressional district and the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This new bill is still flawed because its basic premise is that taxpayers have to take over these toxic loans from ailing institutions, and Secretary Paulson is still granted the unprecedented authority to purchase almost any troubled asset or financial instrument he deems necessary, effectively allowing him to become a financial dictator. Tax expert Ryan Ellis has rightly stated that with this bill, "Congress is giving a member of the executive branch virtually unlimited power for the entire  economy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill today is very similar to the legislation that was voted down only a few days ago, but this time it contains frivolous add-ons. With the exception of the necessary increase of the FDIC insurance limit to $250,000, which I am happy to see included, this bill leaves little to be desired for American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be specific, the Senate version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that we are voting on today contains both energy and non-energy related tax extender language, targeted earmarks, and mental health parity legislation--provisions which have no business being placed into a bill which is meant to rescue our economy from a financial meltdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mental health parity bill that has been thrown into the 440-page Economic Stabilization Act federally imposes more financial responsibility on employers who are already struggling to pay for their employees' health insurance, and will come at an additional cost of $3.8 billion dollars. Further, the bill we are voting on today contains narrowly targeted earmarks which are being described as "tax relief provisions." Buried within this 440-page bill is a temporary increase in the amount of  rum excise tax revenue paid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; a 7-year recovery period for motorsports racetrack property; an economic development credit for American Samoa; tax benefits for fishermen and those who suffered from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill; and even an</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a bailout is still a bailout no matter which way you try to paint it. The American people understand full well that these targeted tax relief provisions were added for the sole purpose of winning votes, and today we are not voting on a clean bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe there are viable, alternative ways to solve our deep-rooted financial problems without having to utilize a taxpayer-funded bailout strategy. Under this bill we have no way of determining how the Treasury Secretary will choose to price the toxic assets he will buy, and pricing them too low or too high will have serious repercussions. Some of our Nation's top economists along with my own colleagues have proposed far better solutions that would protect taxpayers and shore up our  markets without rewarding Wall Street's bad behavior and putting us on a precarious path toward Socialism. I have personally proposed providing low-interest loans to these struggling financial institutions combined with giving taxpayers warrants so that they too can gain from any potential upside in our markets. I also support expanding the FDIC to cover all transaction accounts and put in place an oversight board that is separate from the Congress and the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of a lack of adequate oversight to protect taxpayers is truly worrisome. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, points out that a plan which relies on the sole authority of the former chairman of a major investment bank to distribute billons of taxpayer dollars to struggling private sector companies will inevitably lead to corruption and crony capitalism. Further, Harvard political history professor Julian Zelizer has said of Paulson's unprecedented new powers: "It ranks with  the top list of delegations of power, especially since there's some flexibility for Treasury in deciding what to do with all of this money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You don't like to give power over finance and taxes to people who are not democratically accountable like Congress is."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a matter of 1 week we have gone from a 2 1/2 -page bill, to a 109-page bill, and now to a 440-page bill, but no matter the increase and attempt at improvement, the bill is still inherently flawed. I think it is unfortunate that we haven't taken the necessary time to more carefully consider our options and to re-evaluate some of the more troubling financial trends that have directly contributed to this historic crisis For example, I question why Congress hasn't addressed the issue of Credit-Default  Swaps, CDS--a $62 trillion, unregulated market that threatens to be our next financial crisis. Warren Buffett describes these insurance-like contracts that promise to cover losses on securities in the event of a default as "financial weapons of mass destruction." The CDS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, the challenges that lie ahead of us are numerous and great. We are in the middle of a financial crisis of epic proportions, and I do hope the bill we are voting on today helps to shore up our markets and provide stability, but reluctantly I must oppose it. This legislation has been forced upon us by Secretary Paulson, and I question his ability to objectively implement the Treasury plan given his close ties to major investment banks and Wall Street. Surely Paulson's 25 years spent  at Goldman Sachs and eventually becoming its chairman represents an overt conflict of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the fact that taxpayers are getting toxic goods and there is no real reform of the Community Investment Act which has forced banks to make loans to people who have questionable credit and cannot afford to pay their mortgage back, I am voting against this bill, and I pray and hope the future will afford us a chance to craft a better bill on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise again in reluctant support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke earlier this week about the necessity for the underlying economic rescue legislation and I stand by that statement. If anything, the events of the last week have demonstrated that point even more vividly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit crisis that is gripping America is choking Main Street and affecting Americans of all walks of life. Businesses, small and large alike, are finding it more and more difficult to get credit to run their businesses. This slowdown is costing American jobs. Just today the administration announced that another 159,000 jobs were lost in September, the largest monthly loss in more than 5 years. That means we've lost nearly 800,000 jobs in the first 9 months of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share my constituents' deep anger over this situation created by the greed of lenders and Wall Street players, the inattentiveness of Federal regulators, and the overall failure of the Bush administration's policies. We must act quickly and this proposal to meet this crisis is the best option we have. I know it would be much easier for me to take the easier, more popular route and vote against this measure, but I believe that would be the wrong choice for my district and my country for all  the reasons I laid out earlier in the week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation adds a number of provisions to the economic rescue package the House considered on Monday, most of which are unrelated to the financial crisis. I support many of them and oppose others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill temporarily raises deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 in federally insured banks and credit unions. This is a good step to increase confidence in our banking system and a long overdue update to this critical protection for the assets of millions of American families and small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill protects some 22 million taxpayers from the effect of the Alternative Minimum Tax. This is a tax provision intended to keep the wealthiest in our society from avoiding all income taxes but, because it hasn't been updated in decades, now threatens to ensnare millions of middle income taxpayers with higher taxes. I hope that in the next Congress we can permanently fix this increasingly difficult problem but we must at least stave off its ill effects for this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill includes critically important mental health parity legislation. It would require insurance companies to treat coverage of mental health services the same as other medical services. As a public health nurse, I know there should be no distinction in the necessity of treating heart disease, bone disease, or mental health disease. I have long supported this effort to destigmatize mental health and ensure that Americans suffering from mental health problems can receive treatment. This  is an extremely positive step forward for health care in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the bill extends Federal support for the development of wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources. I have been arguing for a 5-10 year extension of these provisions to encourage the development of alternative energy so we can finally break our crippling addiction to fossil fuels. Establishing a long term investment horizon for these efforts is critical to making that work. These extensions should be for longer than the 1-3 years included in this bill but they cannot  be allowed to expire, which most would do by the end of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, included in these energy tax provisions is support for so-called clean coal production and shale oil extraction. The oil and gas industry could not possibly be more profitable and needs more taxpayer support like Warren Buffett needs investment advice. In addition, both the oil and coal industries already received overly generous taxpayer subsidies in the Republican's 2005 energy bill. I do not support these provisions and believe they should be removed or repealed in the next  Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, much of the cost of these energy tax breaks are not offset so they will increase the already huge Bush deficits. In an effort to reinstate fiscal discipline, House Democrats have consistently voted to pay for these alternative energy production tax breaks by closing corporate loopholes and other measures. It's a shame the Senate cannot follow suit and we are faced with a take-it or leave-it choice on continuing these important alternative energy provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am very concerned about the inclusion of language giving the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, the go-ahead to alter or suspend so-called "mark to market" accounting principles. The SEC just issued what it calls "clarifications" on these rules at the behest of the financial services industry and I believe this could be a big mistake. Investors simply must be able to trust that a company's financial statements give a clear and accurate portrait of the health of the company  and "mark to market" is part of ensuring that is the case. I understand that today's market conditions make establishing prices for securities difficult, but we have to be careful that we don't enable the kind of opaque accounting that has led to numerous financial debacles in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite my concerns about these provisions, I still believe it is in the best interests of the country to pass this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the mental health parity provisions contained in <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These important provisions of the bipartisan legislation would not have been possible without the vigorous advocacy of the late Senator Paul Wellstone and the continued dedication and commitment of Senator Wellstone's family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I want to thank Congressmen KENNEDY and RAMSTAD as well as Senators KENNEDY and DOMENICI. Without their tireless efforts, these provisions would not be before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mental illness and substance abuse affect millions of families across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without treatment, those suffering from mental illness and substance abuse often struggle to hold a job or make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, approximately 44 million Americans suffer from mental illness, but only one-third receive treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A key component of this problem is that private health insurers generally provide less coverage for mental illnesses and substance abuse than for other medical conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation study found that, while 98 percent of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance had coverage for mental health care, 74 percent of those workers were subject to annual outpatient visit limits, and 64 percent were subject to annual inpatient daily limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill amends the Employer Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, to prohibit employer group health plans from imposing mental health or substance abuse treatment limitations, financial requirements, or out-of-network coverage limitations unless comparable limitations requirements are imposed upon medical-surgical benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The out-of-network coverage provisions are particularly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this provision, if a health plan permits individuals to go to an emergency room for a medical condition without prior authorization; or an out-of-network hospital or treatment center at in-network rates for a medical condition, then the plan must apply the same rules to an individual suffering from a mental illness or substance disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill does not require group health plans to provide any mental health or substance abuse coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, if the group health plan does offer mental health and/or substance abuse benefits, there must be equity between mental health and/or substance abuse coverage and all comparable medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, more Americans will be able to access affordable mental health and substance abuse benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing in the bill is intended to preempt stronger state mental health and substance abuse parity laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Education and Labor has analyzed each state's mental health and substance abuse law; it is our understanding and intent that this legislation will not pre-empt any of these laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, a state law that may contain broader or more favorable mental health and/or substance abuse benefit requirements will not be pre-empted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill directs the Department of Labor to provide information and assistance to individuals, employers, and states in order to help them comply with the requirements of this law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to end the stigma and provide fair coverage to those in need.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of providing much needed assistance to the millions of workers struggling to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the Wall Street bailout we just passed, extending unemployment benefits will actually help to keep people in their homes. Unlike giving a $700 billion blank check to Henry Paulson, extending unemployment benefits will stimulate the economy and will bring money into local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month the economy lost 160,000 jobs--the ninth month in a row of job loss. Without congressional action, 800,000 workers are expected to lose their unemployment benefits in October. In my State of California, the unemployment rate is 7.7 percent and climbing. Many of these workers are exhausting their benefits and are unable to find work. This legislation will provide immediate relief to these workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we heard a lot of bluster about Main Street. Make no mistake, people are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table. Wall Street has already gotten their share; I urge all of my colleagues to make sure that we take this small step to help millions of workers get their share.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while I am personally opposed to this bill, and have set forth my reasons elsewhere in this debate, the Judiciary Committee has nevertheless assisted the bill's drafters in an effort to help ensure that it does not inadvertently impair fundamental legal rights and protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would like to further illuminate Congress's intent with respect to three provisions in section 119 of the bill, the section regarding judicial review and related matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the limitation on injunctive and other equitable relief in section 119(a)(2)(A). This provision is written in light of the expected need for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, "TARP," established under the bill in the Treasury Department to be able to act quickly on its decisions to purchase particular assets in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the grounds for obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief, which could potentially impair the efficiency of the TARP's response to breaking market developments, is limited to remedying constitutional violations, while all underlying rights, and the availability of monetary damages where warranted, are preserved. Moreover, even in cases of constitutional remedy, there are special provisions in section 119(a)(2)(B)-(D) for expediting resolution of the matter in court.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H10789]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be kept in mind that the bill provides for a number of avenues to protect against possible overreaching by the Secretary or the TARP, including a special Inspector General, ongoing Government Accountability Office review, and a congressional oversight panel. Nor do the limits alter the normal rules governing agency rulemaking or adjudication, which are not the sort of actions that require the same kind of rapid response envisioned for TARP's marketplace decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the provision regarding homeowners' rights in section 119(b)(1). This provision clarifies that a sale of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities to the TARP in no way impairs the claims or defenses of the homeowners whose mortgages are involved. All rights and interests of the homeowners, whether under the terms of the mortgage instrument or under law, are fully preserved. This means, among other things, that the TARP, in acquiring interests in these securities, does not thereby obtain  the right to use any of the extraordinary collection methods and other recourse that is available solely to the Government, which it has been given for collecting fines and other debts owed directly to the Government which the homeowners here did not contract to be subject to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision does not prevent modifications to which the homeowner agrees, such as a reduction in interest rate, reduction in loan principal, waiver of fees and unpaid interest, or other forbearance that enables the homeowner to avoid foreclosure, continue living in the home, and keep the mortgage. In fact, this provision is designed to encourage TARP to consider such modifications whenever prudent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it often will be, benefitting the investors in the mortgage-backed debt as well as the homeowners involved. The costs of foreclosure to the investors--leaving aside the costs to the homeowner, and the community of which the homeowner is a part--will generally far exceed the costs to investors of a mortgage modification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, taking into account costs such as foreclosure expenses, damage to vacant homes, maintenance, the loss from sales of vacant property in a declining market, the net recovery by investors in a foreclosure situation can be a small fraction of the amount owed on the mortgage. Many foreclosed homes end up being sold in bulk through distress sales, for only a few thousand dollars each. And all of this feeds a vicious circle of increasing foreclosures and declining home values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Loan modifications are almost invariably better for the investors, who continue to receive a steady stream of mortgage payments, as well as for the homeowner, who is able to stay in the home, for the neighborhood that keeps more of its homes occupied and property values supported, and for the entire community that benefits from the homeowner's economic contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the savings clause in section 119(b)(2). As written, this provision is a combination of two separate sentences. And the first sentence has two separate purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One purpose of the first sentence is to preserve current and future responsibility for wrongdoing, and to ensure that this legislation is not interpreted to relieve wrongdoers from accountability or liability to those whom they have harmed. The Congress is aware of civil litigation brought by shareholders, ERISA participants, or by or on behalf of financial institutions, against officers, directors, and in some cases counterparties whose alleged misconduct caused or contributed to their losses.  The Congress is also aware of media reports of criminal investigations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These matters are for the justice system to resolve. The Secretary, and the Executive Branch in general, should cooperate as appropriate with public and private efforts to recover losses from wrongdoers in the financial market, whether those efforts are brought by a governmental entity, securities purchasers, employees, or the corporation itself, or are asserted on behalf of the corporation derivatively. Nothing in this Act is intended to impair any legal rights as against private parties to  recover for or redress wrongdoing under Federal or State law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other purpose of the first sentence is to clarify, similarly as with mortgage-backed securities in section 119(b)(1), that a transfer of nonmortgage financial assets to the TARP does not impair any of the underlying rights, claims, and defenses of borrowers who are not in privity with the TARP and have not contracted for or consented to any such impairment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This does not affect the ability of the TARP and the financial institution transferring the assets to contract between themselves as to which rights and obligations related to those assets will be assumed by Treasury, and which rights and obligations will be retained by the financial institution. Rather, it clarifies that whichever of them deals with the borrower going forward must do so on the same terms, and owes the same duties, as under the original agreement, so that the rights the borrower  contracted for or enjoys under law are in no way impaired. Again, this means, among other things, that the TARP, in acquiring these assets, does not thereby obtain the right to use any of the extraordinary collection methods and other recourse that are available solely to the Government, which it has been given for collecting fines and other debts owed directly to it--which the borrowers here did not contract to be subject to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second sentence in section 119(b)(2) addresses what has come to be termed "tranche warfare"--litigation among the various categories, or tranches, of investors in structured mortgage-backed securities, each vying for primacy in any modification of terms, at each other's expense. This sentence clarifies that, except as established by contract, a servicer of pooled residential mortgages that become subject to the TARP, if that servicer owes any duty to ensure that net present value of payments  on a loan exceeds anticipated recovery in foreclosure, owes that duty not to any individual investor or faction of investors, but to the investors as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the servicer, in agreeing to or implementing a modification or workout plan shall be deemed to be acting in the best interests of all such investors or holders of beneficial interests if the servicer takes reasonable loss mitigation actions, including partial payments. This clarification is intended to further encourage modifications to mortgage loans when, in the judgment of the loan servicer, in the overall interests of the investors.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support, with reservations, for the Senate amendments to <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is facing a crisis that we've not seen since the early 1930s. If we do nothing, our small businesses will continue to suffer with limited access to credit, families will struggle to pay for college for their children and too many people will have to delay their retirement. Retirees with pension plans invested in the market will find they are not as secure as they hoped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just today, the Government announced that 159,000 jobs were lost in September, the sharpest drop in jobs in over 5 years. This is the ninth straight month of job losses. Two weeks ago, with the economy on the verge of disaster, and the choking off of access to credit, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urged congressional leaders to act on this emergency economic rescue package by saying, "If we don't do this, we may not have an economy on Monday." These are words no Member of Congress wants  to hear, but it is a call to action, now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted for the original bipartisan compromise the House considered Monday because it took necessary steps to protect American taxpayers, including a recoupment provision to ensure that every dime of taxpayer money is paid back in full. Republican and Democratic leaders supported the original compromise to get our economy back on track. The bill was far from perfect, but it also included provisions to ensure aggressive congressional and judicial oversight of the rescue programs, as well as no  taxpayer-funded "golden parachutes" for careless Wall Street CEOs. The bill would have spread out the expenditures to make sure they are really needed, and mandated: 48-hour posting of all transactions on the Internet; warrants so taxpayers share profits; aggressive foreclosure mitigation activities, tax provisions helping community banks; and independent Inspector General oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when the House failed to pass the bill on Monday, the Dow dropped 777 points, the largest single-day point drop in history. It cost the American economy more than $1.2 trillion as Americans saw their 401Ks, college accounts, and pension plans lose value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a co-chair of the fiscally responsible Blue Dog Coalition, I have grave concerns about any legislation that passes off the costs to our children and grandchildren, adding to our $9.6 trillion debt. I would have strongly preferred that the Senate version of the bill had been written differently without all of their unrelated tax policy additions, but this is not about me. This is about preserving our way of life as a nation and restoring our economic strength. This is about making sure the  economy doesn't crash to the extent that it might take decades for our children and grandchildren to put the pieces back together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake: this crisis should not be about political opportunism. This is a time for Republicans and Democrats who are willing to put country before party, and our economic security before ideology, to come together and do what is in the best interest of our people and our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am just as upset as many of my constituents that our country is faced with this economic crisis. Government intervention should always be an option of last resort, but we are left with very few choices and even less time to preserve our economic stability. Inaction is simply not an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this difficult time, Congress must act. The Senate has spoken in a strong, bipartisan  way, voting for this revised legislation by a vote of 74-25. The leadership of both parties and our two presidential candidates support this effort to rescue our faltering economy. In the short term, this relief package is an emergency line of credit, a lifeline for our drowning financial industry. In the long term, it's also an investment in bringing back a strong  economy. If our economy does not recover, if we slide toward recession or worse, we will all suffer. I support this bill because I believe it's the right thing to do for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But enacting this emergency legislation is only the beginning. While we had to act today to preserve our economy, I will continue fighting for fiscal responsibility, putting an end to runaway deficits and our mounting $9.6 trillion debt. I will work with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee to aggressively investigate what went wrong in the credit markets, and work in a bipartisan way to improve the regulatory structure so we can have a modern oversight  structure that will make sure firms act in a responsible way. We must continue to do all we can to protect the future economic health of the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it was an amazing turn of events that made the treatment parity legislation Patrick Kennedy and I introduced, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the vehicle for one of the most far-reaching bills considered in our lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a rescue bill for the U.S. economy and a rescue bill for the millions of Americans suffering from mental illness and addiction. It will also prevent a devastating tax increase on middle-income families and job creators at a time our families and economy cannot afford more blows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This vote will mean the end of 12 long years of fighting for treatment parity for mental illness and addiction. This is not just another public policy issue: It's a matter of life or death for 54 million Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and 26 million suffering from chemical addiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year alone, more than 30,000 Americans committed suicide from untreated depression and 150,000 Americans died as the direct result of chemical addiction. On top of the tragic loss of lives, untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy over $550 billion a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm alive and sober today only because of the access I had to treatment following my last alcoholic blackout on July 31, 1981, when I woke up in a jail cell in Sioux Falls, SD. I'm living proof that treatment works and recovery is possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But far too many people in our country don't have the same access to treatment that I and other Members of Congress have had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A major barrier for thousands of Americans is insurance discrimination against people in health plans who need treatment for mental illness or chemical addiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are passing today will end this discrimination by prohibiting health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment for people with mental illness or addiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No more inflated deductibles or copayments that don't apply to physical diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No more limited treatment stays that don't apply to physical diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No more discrimination against people with mental illness or chemical addiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act" simply provides equal treatment for diseases of the brain and the body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing treatment equity is not only the right thing to do; it's also the cost-effective thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the empirical data, including major actuarial studies, show that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save literally billions of dollars nationally. At the same time, it will not raise premiums more than two- tenths of 1 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, for less than the price of a cheap cup of coffee per month, millions of people could receive treatment for chemical addiction and mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Rep. Patrick Kennedy and I have traveled the country from one end to the other--holding 14 field hearings on the critical need for treatment parity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard literally hundreds of stories of human suffering, broken families, tragic deaths, ruined careers and shattered dreams--all because of insurance companies not providing access to adequate treatment for mental illness and addiction. We will change that today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory barriers to treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to join the coalition of insurance companies and business groups that support parity because they know it's cost-effective and saves health care dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to make this bipartisan legislation the law of the land. The people of America cannot afford to wait any longer for Congress to act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I didn't take pleasure in voting yes today. But in tough times, Congress is required to make tough decisions. Voting for this bill is a risk, yes. But voting against this bill is a greater risk. Given the prevailing, dreadful economic trends, a bet that our economy will miraculously right itself on its own, without significant damage to the jobs and livelihoods of the people in my district and across America, is the greater risk I am not willing to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are facing a startling reality. Without action, student loans, home loans, and lines of credit for local businesses will tighten, and eventually be cut entirely. With no credit source from which to pay employees, business will impose massive layoffs. Farmers, whose products are so vital to the Second District economy and who depend on a secure line of credit during planting season, won't have a crop. People facing foreclosure will not be able to refinance their mortgages, and will lose their  homes. People looking to retire will have to take on part-time employment, or delay retirement entirely, because their savings, 401(k)s and pension plans will have been drained of assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish the bill we took up today was a cleaner bill. I wish we could have passed the bill Monday, and saved our deficit another $150 billion. Many of the provisions added onto this bill, especially relief for middle class taxpayers, are needed, but they add to the bill's cost. And any other day, I would stand firmly opposed until those costs were off-set.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is not "any other day"--this is an extraordinary day, and these are extraordinary circumstances. The economy is on life support and not passing this bill would be tantamount to pulling the plug. Not passing it would imperil the very opportunities our society is known for, and that we behold as integral to American life: the chance to go college, run a business, own a home, enjoy retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the poor, for those who have been financially prudent, for the unemployed, for those who saw their 401(k)s dwindle this is not the end. In the coming months, it is my hope that Congress pours as much or more effort into investigating the financiers whose actions precipitated this crisis and who walked away with millions for themselves, as we have put into crafting this bill. It is also my hope we can repair the damage done the deficit. Meantime, I encourage my colleagues and my constituents  to join me in supporting this first step toward regaining our financial footing and setting in place a new system, one that lacks the greed and the excess that brought us to this point in the first place.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I voted against this bailout package on Monday, because I took a hard look at it through the eyes of Coloradans, and I didn't see what they needed to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I saw was a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street banks that didn't do enough to reassure taxpayers that they'd get their money back, didn't have a sure process for holding CEOs accountable and limiting taxpayer-funded golden parachutes, and didn't address the mortgage crisis that is at the root of our economic problems and is forcing hard-working Coloradans out of their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as important, what I saw was a "rescue" for Wall Street that did nothing to begin fixing the broken financial system that led us to this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look at the legislation we're being asked to vote on today, I'm deeply disappointed to say that none of that has changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Senate has sent us a bill that adds a single improvement to the package the House rejected, plus hundreds of pages of "sweeteners" intended to win over those of us who opposed it the first time. Many of those "sweeteners" are things I support--the people of Colorado know I have worked long and hard for middle-class tax breaks and have spent my entire career as a champion for investment in the new energy economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But no amount of "sweetener" changes the fact that Americans deserve a better solution to our economic crisis than the one we've already rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no interest in making the perfect the enemy of the good. Anyone who knows my work in Congress knows that I am not a "my-way-or-the-highway" legislator. Because of the greed and lack of oversight on Wall Street, we face an unquestionably grave economic situation that requires Congress to act. But a better solution is still within our reach--one that takes immediate action to get our economy back on stable footing while providing the protection, oversight, and fundamental reforms American  families deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am still guided by the words of the legendary basketball coach John Wooden, who told his players, "Boys, be quick. But don't hurry."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope was that after the House rejected Monday's bailout package, we in Congress would be quick to work together, improve the  legislation, and bring forward a revised version that would deserve and obtain broad support in Colorado and across the country. We had that opportunity until the Senate acted to re-package the old bailout bill in new clothing. We owe the taxpayers more than to hurry a deeply flawed package out the door at such tremendous cost  to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we could have added provisions that (1) provided independent oversight of the Treasury's program, (2) strengthened the equity position of taxpayers in purchasing mortgage-backed assets, (3) required the government to help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, and (4) insured that taxpayers will not be on the hook for irresponsible compensation packages for CEOs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill claims to address these problems, but the exceptions in this bill swallow the rule. In short, the bill doesn't do what it claims to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, stronger provisions were within our reach and we should have worked to secure them</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope--for the sake of all those people who have worked hard and played by the rules, only to see their retirement whittled away or their homes' values plummet--that this package does what its supporters promise us it will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the end, my responsibility is to Colorado families, and I continue to believe as I did on Monday, that I cannot ask them to foot the bill for a bailout that costs so much, with so little accountability, so little reform, and so little protection for them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Since this House rejected an earlier plan to intervene, the bad economic news has kept rolling in and the dangers to Main Street businesses have increased. Only today it was announced that 159,000 American jobs were lost in September alone. This kind of news combined with the tremendous declines we've seen in the markets only underscores our need to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to share the anger of most Americans about the need to take these unprecedented steps, but I remain more convinced today that we must act decisively to contain this economic contagion before it spreads into the far reaches of our economy and leaves lasting damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this bill added an important provision to increase the insurance guarantees on personal deposits by the FDIC and a number of tax provisions, it remains similar to the package that I reluctantly supported earlier this week. While this bill is far from perfect, I believe it addresses the economic crisis in a responsible way that helps Wall Street while still looking out for Main Street and protecting our tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would still institute limits on executive compensation and golden parachutes for the executives of companies that take part in the plan. It puts in place real oversight, from the courts, from Congress and from a new Inspector General's office and finally installs significant Government supervision and regulation of the companies that helped to put us in the situation we're in now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also puts in place mechanisms to make sure that taxpayer dollars will be protected to the maximum extent possible. To the extent that our investment is not recouped, the President will have to come up with a plan to make sure that the companies taking out this Government loan will have to pay back the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The financial industry is of great importance to New York State, which relies on our financial institutions for a significant percentage of tax revenue and jobs. The Hudson Valley is particularly vulnerable to difficulties on Wall Street, and I fear that the workers, small business owners, and families in my district will face severe economic ramifications if we do not stem the tide of this financial crisis. That is the primary reason that I feel I must vote yes today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the ripples of the credit crisis are already impacting some of the small businesses in my district. Jeff Conston, owner of Dutchess Recreational Vehicles in Poughkeepsie, contacted me to tell me that his customers are finding it very hard to get financing to purchase the equipment he sells. He has 34 employees who handle sales, parts and service for his dealership. He urged us to get this financial rescue plan passed so the financing for his customers and his business can start flowing  again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another local businessman, William L. Spearman, Chief Executive Officer of the Mid-Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union in my district, told me that while his credit union's balance sheet remains strong, his members are so concerned about our financial system that they are withdrawing money just to put it in their mattresses. In his view, the financial system is frozen and we need to pass this bill to provide confidence to his members and to get the system moving again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I am pleased that the legislation sent back from the Senate includes some important tax relief provisions that I believe Congress should pass this year. Chief among this is a one year "patch" that will protect thousands of middle class families from being hit by the AMT this year. Last year over 30,000 families in my district paid AMT, and this bill will ensure that an additional 70,000 families in my district will not also be obliged to pay it. I wish we had the support to permanently  fix the AMT, and help the middle class families that are still subject to it, however once again the "patch" legislation that we consider today is the best legislation that we can pass at this time and I will support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also grateful that this legislation contains a number of tax breaks to help individuals and small businesses. Given the economic troubles we are in the midst of, tax breaks for research and development and for teachers who use their own money to purchase supplies for the students are desperately needed and could not come at a better time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes some important provisions to help shore up our economy in the long term by moving us away from imported fossil fuels and toward energy independence. The critical tax incentives in this bill for wind, solar, hydropower, marine energy, and the purchase of advanced plug-in hybrid vehicles will create thousands of green jobs here in America that can't be outsourced, help cut consumer energy costs, and give individual families and businesses the power to help fight climate  change and end our dependence on foreign oil. Although I am deeply disappointed by the inclusion of incentives for coal to liquids technology and tar sands and oil shale exploration, which will not meet these goals, this package is still critical to our future and worthy of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this plan is only a first step. What created this crisis was the Bush administration's and previous Congress's failure to stem reckless behavior on Wall Street, and we cannot allow that lapse in oversight to be repeated. I am pleased that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will begin hearings soon on the causes of this crisis and that there is acknowledgement that we must work to make more fundamental investments in the true engine of our economy, American workers, innovation,  and small businesses, in order to more permanently strengthen our prosperity. Congress must remain vigilant, aware of how this tremendous authority is being exercised by the administration and in the markets, and ready to intervene at the first hint of abuse or ineffectiveness.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as the American people have witnessed over the past several days, the instability in the financial markets requires immediate attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The longer this instability continues, the harder it will be for employers to meet payroll, for retirement plans to meet their obligation to retirees, and for families to access the credit they need to pay for college, for a car, for a home, or for just getting by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The road has been difficult, but the risk posed to everyday Americans is simply too great not to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents and I were appalled when President Bush asked us to hand over $700 billion with no oversight, no accountability, and no reforms to the fundamentally flawed policies that allowed this crisis to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to bipartisan cooperation--and now compromise between the Senate and the House of Representatives--this economic recovery proposal is fundamentally different than the proposal first brought to us by President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have an economic recovery proposal before us that will protect the interests of hardworking Americans by:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Restoring investor confidence in our economy and the financial markets;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting taxpayers by requiring full transparency of actions taken by the Treasury Secretary, creating a strong oversight board appointed by Congress, and establishing an independent Inspector General to guarantee compliance;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring fiscal responsibility by making resources available in installments that require congressional and Presidential approval, and guaranteeing that the financial services industry repays any losses to the U.S. Treasury;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Helping distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure by facilitating loan modifications; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Limiting the compensation for the corporate executives that created this crisis by eliminating multimillion dollar golden parachutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote for the proposal before us today because I believe that the current economic crisis requires action by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate that the Senate took this opportunity to add unrelated measures to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These measures include items that I have strongly supported--such as: mental health parity; Alternative Minimum Tax relief; property tax relief; the personal deduction for higher education expenses; incentives for energy  conservation and the development of alternative and renewable energy; and the extension of current tax policies that encourage innovation and help U.S. companies compete internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support these proposals and I appreciate that they will become law by our action today. But, I believe that we should have--and could have--covered the cost of these provisions, had the Senate not acted first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also embarrassing that just a few Senators would use this critical economic recovery proposal to enact narrowly targeted tax benefits--risking passage and angering American taxpayers who have rightfully called for reform of such practices</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, action is required to stabilize our financial markets. We must begin the process of economic recovery by making credit and capital available to families and businesses of all sizes to meet their obligations and move this country forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is still more to do. We must focus on the regulation of our financial markets, strong enforcement, and sound fiscal policies in Government and in the private sector that are all necessary to restore our economy to one of prosperity, opportunity and growth--not just for a few--but for all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 4 days ago, I opposed a bailout plan that did too little for homeowners, too much for executives, and nothing to prevent Wall Street from repeating the mistakes that got us into this crisis. That bill would have put the U.S. taxpayer on the hook for $700 billon to bail out Wall Street, the very people whose irresponsibility helped to undermine America's economy and threaten the jobs and life savings of millions of American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake: America faces a serious crisis. We must do something, but we cannot let fear drive our decision-making. Our solution should meet the demands of the day without producing more suffering in the future. We have the time to get this right, but the proposal we considered on Monday had significant problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that time, I suggested several commonsense changes to Monday's bill. Those changes have not been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said we must do more to protect taxpayers. Today's bill still falls short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said we should do more to protect responsible homeowners and their neighbors from foreclosures and plummeting property values. This bill still falls short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said we must ensure executives who ran their companies into the ground cannot walk away with millions in taxpayer-funded golden parachutes. This bill still falls short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I said that while American taxpayers continue to struggle we should not bail out foreign companies whose governments are doing nothing. Again, this bill still falls short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most importantly, this legislation does nothing to protect us from facing a similar crisis in the future. Today's situation is the direct result of a culture in Washington that allowed Wall Street to gamble with America's future. This legislation sends the message that when Wall Street's gambles do not pay off, the taxpayer will bail them out. Imagine for a moment that you send a friend into a casino and tell him: if you win, you keep the winnings; if you lose, I'll pay your losses. You  would expect nothing but irresponsibility, and that is exactly what this bill will give us. We need commonsense rules to protect against that irresponsibility, and this bill provides none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all these reasons, I will vote against today's proposal, just as I voted against very similar legislation 4 days ago. The only difference between this bill and the bill we rejected on Monday that has anything to do with America's financial markets is an increase in FDIC insurance limits. This may do something, but it is nowhere near enough to justify supporting today's bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether or not this legislation passes today, Congress must keep working on a new framework for our financial system. Experts have produced good proposals on a variety of issues. Some have even passed this House. But we also need to begin working on a systemic overhaul of our regulatory structures, our financial rules, and the incentives that govern our markets. In this hour of crisis, we have a rare opportunity to protect future generations from the turmoil we have seen. We must seize this opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Senate has chosen to add unrelated provisions rather than fixing a deeply flawed proposal. I want to note that my vote today does not suggest any disagreement with the important package of tax cuts that was added in the last few days. I have consistently supported tax cuts for the middle class, including fixes for the Alternative Minimum Tax. I have advocated mental health parity legislation, and voted for it repeatedly. I have fought for tax credits to spur green industries  and produce jobs. And I have worked to protect the Secure Rural Schools and Payment In Lieu of Taxes programs that would be extended by this bill. However, even with these provisions, I cannot support a $700 billion taxpayer bailout--a plan that will have a large and widespread impact for generations--that has been rushed through with so many serious flaws and so many problems left unaddressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's vote is difficult, but I believe it is what's right for New Mexico's Third Congressional District, and the people of New Mexico and our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, many of my constituents have called and written me in opposition to the current plan to deal with the Nations financial crisis. I consider this to be one of the most serious and important issues I have dealt with in my 14 years in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father was born in 1919 into a poor working class family in New York City. During his most critical formative years from the time he was 10, until he went off to fight in WWII, all he knew was the deprivation of the great depression. He and his brothers and sisters regularly went to bed hungry, on many nights dinner consisted of a choice of either a ketchup or a mustard sandwich.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a good student, nonetheless had to drop out of school at age 15 so he could go to work, often making only pennies a day, but his family needed food. After the war he met my mother and had a family and was never able to go back to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that emerged from his experience was a tremendous amount of appreciation for having a good job and the importance of saving and preparing for retirement. Those enduring values he passed on to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, our Nation is faced with what is being described by many economists as the worst financial crisis since the great depression. With the decline in the housing market there are many banks and other financial institutions that have been adversely effected. This has caused many of these banks to have to stop or reduce lending money. Many banks have gone bankrupt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that this problem was started by the Federal Government's efforts to modify lending rules to allow those with lower incomes and poor credit scores to purchase homes, often with no money down. The inappropriate and meddling actions by the Government-sponsored entities Fannie May and Freddie Mac laid the groundwork for this crisis and it was made worse by unscrupulous Wall Street Bankers and mortgage brokers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What started as a housing market decline has now become a credit crisis effecting global finance, and it is beginning to affect the retirement savings of millions of Americans and our national economy. Many companies are starting to find it difficult to get financing and we are starting to have leaders in finance and business tell us that if this is not contained we may begin to see spreading business failures and unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is against this backdrop that Treasury Secretary Paulson and the head of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke originally proposed a plan that calls for the U.S. Treasury to purchase with cash many of these mortgage backed securities held by these banks. Many of the assets are backed by real estate, but because there is no market for them today the bankers are being told they are worthless under the new accounting rules put in place after the Enron scandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Banks loan out money at a ratio of 10 to 1. For every 100 dollars of assets they have on their books they are able to make $1,000 in loans. The banks that now hold these mortgaged backed securities have seen the value of many of these plummet to zero which has wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of capital from their balance sheets. This has taken trillions of dollars out of the capital markets because of this 10:1 ratio. If you were a bank and on your balance sheet was a $100 million dollars  worth of mortgage backed securities that the accountants are telling you it is worth zero then you can't do $1 billion in loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Paulson Plan called for purchasing these mortgage-backed securities with cash. I was not happy with the original plan put forth by the Secretary. It called for providing him unfettered access to $700 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I voted for on Monday September 29th and which failed to get a majority was a significant improvement over Secretary Paulson's original proposal. It reduced by half the amount of cash he could access without coming back to Congress. It required that he also develop an option other then asset purchase that included offering insurance to back up the value of these mortgage securities. It also had strong restrictions on excessive executive salaries for many of these troubled companies.  No golden parachutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the improvements in the bill it did not get my support because I liked it. I voted for it because I was concerned that inaction was too risky. My preferred approach was that proposed by former FDIC Chairman William Isaac. This plan was never given a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that failed House vote, the Senate took up the bill and it has added some good things. There are several extensions of existing tax breaks that help families and businesses that were due to expire. Two important items are the coritinuation of sales tax deductibility for the people of Florida and the increase of FDIC insurance to $250,000. It also has a provision to modify the alternative minimum tax. If this provision is not enacted over 20 million families in America will be saddled with  huge tax increases next year at a time when they can least afford it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Senate put in several unnecessary items as well such as earmarked tax breaks for special interests. Despite the many flaws in this bill it is the only bill that I will be given a chance to vote on by the Democrat leadership. In light of the very serious problems in our economy, I will give it my support with a yes vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that there are many like-minded conservatives in District 15 of Florida and around the country that disagree. I am reminded at this time of the great controversy surrounding the drafting of the Constitution and its ratification at the birth of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Constitution is revered and it has served out Nation well for over 200 years. But the debate surrounding its drafting and ratification was highly controversial with many patriots at the time being strongly opposed to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time will determine if this financial rescue package will serve our Nation well. I am concerned that we are heading into a recession. This package if it works well will likely not allow us to avert a recession, but may allow us to avert a depression.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Wednesday night, before returning to Washington, I had a telephone townhall in my district with over 5,500 constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm here to report that they are angry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are angry that the Government allowed Wall Street mega-banks and manipulators to act so irresponsibly that they have led our economy to the brink of disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are angry that for over a decade, greed and abuse have been considered higher virtues than oversight and regulation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is facing unprecedented challenges and Congress needs to act, with bipartisanship, to restore confidence in our financial markets and get our economy back on the right track. People are depending on the Government to help restore stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation before us today, passed by the Senate Wednesday, is substantially improved from the version this House rejected on Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my concerns from the earlier bill have been addressed, but not all. But I am in Washington to look for the best deal for the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most significant change is that this rescue package now includes Alternative Minimum Tax relief for my constituents in New Jersey, not just relief for Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous bill presented the taxpayer with a huge bill. This measure contains real relief for the hard-working New Jersey families and I commend the Senate for including what House Democrats have resisted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, no one likes the concept of an unprecedented and expensive Federal Government intervention in our financial markets. But the cold, hard reality is that this rescue package, however oversized, is designed to shield millions of Americans from economic shock waves from problems they did not create.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our economy is built on credit and we need to get credit back into the markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no doubt that our financial markets are in crisis, suffering from a number of problems:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) Banks and other financial institutions have billions of dollars of bad housing-related debt on their books, to the extent that many are technically insolvent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) But we also have a problem stemming from a serious crisis of confidence that has frozen the credit system. Financial institutions are, in essence, "hoarding" capital. Most are not lending money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, we see credit markets which are limiting the ability of people and businesses to borrow. It's a crisis that is affecting a wide range of Americans: Employees working for businesses dependent on available credit to cover payroll or buy inventory; retirees who count on their stocks and other investments to pay their bills and for future expenses; workers who have built pension funds and 401(k)s for their future security; families who have seen their home values drop precipitously,  and their nest eggs are directly related to that value; families trying to buy homes or cars or secure student loans for college; men and women who work every day to keep their small businesses afloat. Without reliable credit, they cannot stay in business, let alone create jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that said, I recognize that many people may not like the expensive rescue plan. But we have no alternative but to approve this legislation and do it quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the package that this House rejected, on a bipartisan basis, on Monday was much stronger than the original proposal offered by the Treasury Secretary 2 weeks ago. That bill cut the Treasury's upfront spending authority in half, included several important taxpayer protections, limitations on executive bonuses, improved bipartisan oversight and deleted "slush fund" financing for such partisan groups as ACORN, and trial lawyer giveaways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the package before us today is vastly improved over Monday's bill. That legislation, in effect, handed the American people nothing but a huge bill to pay. This measure protects middle income Americans from tax increases and gives businesses the financial support they need to create and maintain jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, we are shielding tens of thousands of New Jersey taxpayers from the unfair Alternative Minimum Tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Jersey has the highest per capita rate of citizens subject to the AMT in the country. Without this fix approximately 1.6 million residents of New Jersey, including over 141,000 families in my district, would be subject to the AMT this year. The provisions included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act will prevent approximately an additional 100,000 residents of my district from paying this unfair tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is never a "good time" to raise taxes, but I cannot imagine a worse idea in times of economic slowdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also expands Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protection for bank accounts to $250,000 per account from $100,000. This provision is designed to send a strong signal to depositors, individuals and small businesses alike, that their money is backed by the United States Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax relief for middle-class families and American businesses--the engine of job creation. These include credits and deductions for college tuition, children, and research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extension of renewable energy tax incentives designed to build momentum toward reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Landmark mental health "parity" legislation which will increase health care coverage for Americans suffering with mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also encouraged that the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, has issued accounting guidelines that allow banks to move away from "mark-to-market" accounting rules that artificially undervalue good mortgage assets and have helped aggravate this economic crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, I am confident that, given additional time, we could make even more improvements to this legislation after we listen further to our constituents. However, it has become very apparent to me that we do not have additional time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in "panic mode" brought about by the unwise use of leverage, poor accounting rules, program trading, an explosion in the use of financial instruments, and lax regulation of our markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Credit markets have frozen. Americans everywhere are feeling the pain through their  businesses, through their jobs, through their inability to get a mortgage, or a loan to buy a car, complete a home renovation, or finance a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I stated initially, our economy faces historic and unprecedented challenges. Congress must take swift, decisive and bipartisan action to restore immediate confidence to the markets and set our economy back on the right track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a rescue package designed to shield millions of Americans from catastrophic shock waves of problems they did not create.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to vote yes, and we need to vote now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even after this vote, our work is not done. We need aggressive oversight over the actions of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve and more transparency in our financial markets.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The inclusion of the mental health parity bill, major tax relief and bank deposit, FDIC, insurance increases caused me to reconsider my position and I believe there's too much at stake to let the legislation fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revised bill is a recovery bill for the economy and a recovery bill for millions of Americans suffering the ravages of mental illness and addiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This revised legislation will also protect 22 million middle-income taxpayers from the enormous tax increases of the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Also, the revised bill increases bank deposit insurance limits, FDIC, to $250,000 to protect depositors and help small businesses that need credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will vote for the revised economic recovery plan to help Minnesota's working families, seniors and small businesses during this historic crisis in our economy. The credit crisis is real, and it's destroying jobs, retirement savings and the American dream.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> because it is, in my opinion, our last opportunity to save jobs, save small businesses, and I pray prevent a collapse of our economy. I believe that is what we are facing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard from hundreds of Nebraskans who have contacted me by phone, email, or have just come up to me when I was home. All of them are angry. Angry at the greed, arrogance, and just plain reckless nature of Wall Street. Angry at Congress and the administration who have now proposed using taxpayers' dollars to bail out those greedy investment bankers, traders, and CEOs. People have every right to be angry at these self-important Wall Street executives who cared more about themselves by making  a quick buck no matter the risk or lack of ethics just so they could earn multi-million dollar salaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I share that anger. Maybe even a little more, as my constituents have transferred their anger onto the one who they can reach out to--me. I have to admit that listening to their anger and fright, sharing their true feelings, but knowing that I have the responsibility as their Representative in Congress to do something to help them, has increased my frustration to a level I've never experienced before as a Member of Congress. Still, something must be done. Inaction may be "something,"  but it is not the answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now know that to save ourselves we must also save the pigs. Those greedy pigs on Wall Street don't deserve help from hard-working Americans. But allowing them to fail will cause so many other businesses that conducted their business in good faith, ethically and conservatively to lose access to credit, lose business, and eventually maybe have to close their doors. Yes, even in Nebraska, far away from Wall Street. I have heard from several business leaders in Omaha who say they will have to lay  off some employees if liquidity in our financial system is not restored. One business owner told me they are at risk of shutting their doors and every employee will be laid off. My vote today is to help the people of Nebraska, protect their jobs, and protect their savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, is this bill the best answer? Probably not. I prefer stimulating the economy by eliminating or suspending the capital gains tax, providing an incentive to purchase of homes with a tax credit, transferring the toxic mortgage debt to the free market, using insurance to cover future debt, and encouraging the Federal Reserve to release more money to central banks for increased liquidity. I also support suspending an arcane federal accounting rule mandated on publicly traded companies known as</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mark to market rule forces firms to report the current market value of an asset. So when no market exists at a point in time for an asset then its value is zero or next to zero. But the asset has value and will have more value in the future. The rule is unforgiving and has caused companies to declare they are bankrupt--when they are really worth more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the first bill brought to Congress by Treasury Secretary Paulson on Monday, September 22, was insulting. The bill would have given Secretary Paulson complete control over $700 billion, no questions asked, no transparency, no accountability, and no punishment of the hogs on Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After several listening sessions with Members our leadership began negotiations with Secretary Paulson. These talks were painful and long with many starts and stops and a premature declaration of done deal. After several days, a true deal was announced. Some of the good ideas by Members to improve the bill were included, but very few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew we could do a much better job to protect the taxpayers and I felt the responsibility to continue to try. I also knew that I could vote "no," and allow the bill to fail. Then, maybe then, the administration would listen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's exactly what happened. I voted against it and once again offered seven provisions to the White House and leadership to make it a better bill. Those improvements included suspension of mark to market, more use of FDIC insurance, and reinstating the so-called "uptick" rule. The first two priorities were agreed to and made a part of the final bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill prohibits the use of tax dollars for executive severance packages, creates a board of directors to approve of the Secretary of Treasury's decisions spending tax dollars, greater oversight by Congress, slowing the release of tax dollars, allowing the SEC Chairman to waive the mark to market rule when no market exists for a particular asset (the SEC chairman agreed to do so), and providing insurance to limit the taxpayer's risk of loss where the Government purchased toxic debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to thank a number of individuals in the Omaha community who took the time to talk to me about the bill and legitimacy of the crisis. They made me better informed about this problem from a Nebraska perspective, thereby allowing me to step back and be more thoughtful on how to proceed. Your advice and assistance was much appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is not the perfect solution, it's not even a good one, but it is the solution before us today. And I will support it because I can't look into the eyes of someone who has just lost their job and say, "I did nothing to help."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Monday I urged my colleagues to support economic recovery legislation, and I continue to urge them to do so today. When I voted against the Gramm-Leech-Bliley Act in 1999 I warned my colleagues that the Government would one day be called upon to rescue failing financial institutions. As angry as I am that my prediction was accurate, I know that on this day inaction is not an option. I still have reservations about this legislation. I do not believe it sufficiently  addresses the financial services industry deregulation that allowed this crisis to happen, and I do not believe that it does enough for struggling families. However, I know that the people of this country cannot afford to go another day without action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After our failure to pass this legislation on Monday the stock market suffered the greatest one day decline in its history. The Wall Street executives and investment bankers that got us into this mess surely took a hit, but so too did individual retirement accounts and state pension funds. For example, the State of Michigan estimates that individual investors in the state have lost over $27 billion in the stock market in the last year, and the Michigan Pension Fund lost $2.3 billion on Monday  after the House voted down this plan. Should Wall Street decline further and the value of the dollar continue to fall, it will mean greater unemployment, even higher prices for basic commodities, and access to credit for things like college education or home improvements will be even harder to obtain. The impact on the broader economy will be felt by every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the lack of credit in the marketplace is already affecting some parts of the broader economy. Auto sales were down 27 percent in the past year, in part because consumers cannot get access to credit for car loans. The automobile financing companies are not responsible for the current credit crisis, but they will be eligible to participate in this program to obtain the credit they need to keep vehicle sales strong. This week I learned about a financially sound manufacturing company in  Michigan that is seeking a mortgage to replace its current building, which it has outgrown, with a new facility that will allow the company to expand its operations and add much needed jobs. This company is struggling to even find a bank willing to loan it money. Small and medium-sized businesses did not cause this crisis, but unless this crisis is addressed and the credit markets are restored they will find themselves unable to do business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite my lingering concerns that this is not the best possible way to address this crisis, we clearly have to act to avert a much larger economic failure. In the months ahead, we can continue to revisit these issues and work together to adopt measures that restore the regulatory structure that is supposed to protect the financial system from this kind of failure, and that provide much needed assistance to the hard-working men and women who are suffering because of the economic climate created  by irresponsible parties on Wall Street and here in Washington. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation before us today as a matter of great national urgency.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to submit for the Record a letter of support for the economic rescue plan currently before Congress submitted by the Business Roundtable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 1, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failure to pass emergency legislation to rescue the U.S. financial system will put our entire economy at risk. The resulting turmoil in equity markets has already wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars in household wealth and the retirement savings of the American people. But the impact of this crisis extends well beyond the financial industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As business leaders representing companies that generate more than $5 trillion of U.S. GDP--more than one-third of the U.S. economy--we are already seeing the damage spread to every sector of our economy. Credit is being shut off to both small businesses trying to meet payroll and families struggling to pay college tuition bills. Retail sales are declining each week as consumer confidence collapses. More business failures, job losses and significantly higher unemployment loom on the horizon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further delay will only increase these adverse impacts on America's economy. We urge Congress to act immediately to pass bipartisan legislation to stabilize the U.S. financial system and contain the damage to our broader economy while that opportunity still exists. The American people have always risen to whatever economic challenges they have faced, and with swift congressional action we can meet this crisis and restore our economy to its historic path of strong growth and rising prosperity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the House of Representatives will vote for the second time this week on Secretary Paulson's flawed bailout legislation. His plan lacks the  core principles needed to improve the economy. To be a viable plan, the legislation must include (1) enacting a moratorium on foreclosures, (2) restructuring mortgages to make them more affordable, and (3) prohibiting interest rate increases associated with subprime loans. These  initiatives can be achieved without spending one dollar of the taxpayer's money. In addition, empowering the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to guarantee all depositors and bond holders would provide immediate liquidity to credit markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Congress acts imprudently today, we may end up draining our national treasury of over $700 billion in resources without curing our economic ills. Such a decision could effectively tie the hands of the next President and kill universal health care and job programs before they are ever drafted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz and other leading economists that action must be taken to tackle the problem posed by the tightening of the credit market. I simply disagree with the administration's proposed solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although it hasn't been reported in the mainstream media, there are real legislative alternatives to this bailout that have been vetted by some of the best economic minds in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One plan, offered by Representative Peter DeFazio and other members of the so-called "Bailout Skeptics" Caucus, proposes some common sense changes to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation policies. I have cosponsored this legislation because I believe it will efficiently free-up capital, protect the taxpayer, and give the next President the fiscal flexibility he will need to address the dire problems brought about by the current economic  slowdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another plan, proposed by billionaire financier George Soros, mimics a successful model used in Norway and Sweden. The plan would inject credit into the markets in a direct and low-risk manner by empowering the Treasury Department to purchase preferred stock and discounted common stock from faltering lenders. I called for this type of direct capital deployment measure earlier this week, because it would provide the taxpayers with a tangible return on their investment and keep toxic mortgage-backed  securities off the government's books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of these plans, I and many of my progressive colleagues have continually advocated for bankruptcy reform that would give judges the freedom to renegotiate home mortgages during court proceedings. National Assistance Corporation of America CEO Bruce Marks and I agree that this reform is a necessary component of any bailout plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans have never heard of any of these alternative proposals because they have only been presented with a single, flawed narrative--either accept this bailout plan or tempt economic catastrophe. This is a false choice that, unfortunately, has been successfully peddled by the President's fear-mongers and broadcast by a compliant media.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tactic being used by Paulson creates an atmosphere of fear. The events of the last two weeks are reminiscent of the days leading up to the adoption of the Patriot Act, and to the invasion of Iraq--times where fear-mongering dampened the careful and deliberate consideration of alternative courses of action. This time, instead of scaring the American people with tales of weapons of mass destruction or planes piloted by terrorists, the President bullies the taxpayer with dire warnings of a credit  freeze that will bring our economy to its knees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are serious options for dealing with this crisis that don't involve giving away billions to the richest, most irresponsible businessmen. My vote against the bailout today is not a do-nothing vote; it is a vote for a real solution. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past. Detroiters, Michiganders, Americans, and billions of people around the world are depending on us to get it right.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) will have the ability to support the financial system through the purchase of securities and through investing in equity/preferred securities. I strongly believe equity infusion if used wisely will have greater benefits for our economy and yield higher returns to American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A strong consensus among financiers and economists has developed supporting these conclusions. George Soros, Joeseph Stigliz, Bradford Delong, Paul Krugman, John Makin, Alex Pollack, Lucien Bebchuk, and Edmund Phelps are a sample of the bipartisan expertise that has contributed to the debate and strongly support the finding that using capital infusions rather than distressed asset purchases alone will have a far greater re-invigorating effect on our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If done effectively, equity infusions will introduce 10 to 12 times the amount of the initial government investment into our credit markets. This means that capital infusions of $700 billion would yield credit flow effects totaling $8.4 trillion. In contrast, distressed asset purchases of $700 billion yield credit flow effects of only $700 billion. Capital infusions could give us 12 times the support for the communities and small businesses that badly need credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The capital infusion approach would involve using Warren Buffett type investment strategies and would result in the government owning equity interests in the institutions which are assisted. If these government investments do only half as well as Buffett's investments in distressed institutions such as Goldman Sachs, U.S. taxpayers will earn as much as $200 billion profit when the financial sector recovers. This is far beyond any forecast return to taxpayers from buying distressed assets. In  fact the difference for taxpayers of the two methods could be as large as $375 billion. This will result in lower taxes longer term and better health care, better schools, and a cleaner environment. Because it is sound, transparent and effective, it will restore global confidence in the U.S. economy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Recapitalise the Banking System</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By George Soros)</narrative>
  <narrative>The emergency legislation currently before Congress was ill-conceived--or more accurately, not conceived at all. As Congress tried to improve what Treasury originally requested, an amalgam plan has emerged that consists of Treasury's original Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp) and a quite different capital infusion programme in which the government invests and stabilises weakened banks and profits from the economy's eventual improvement. The capital infusion approach will cost tax payers  less in future years, and may even make money for them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Two weeks ago the Treasury did not have a plan ready--that is why it had to ask for total discretion in spending the money. But the general idea was to bring relief to the banking system by relieving banks of their toxic securities and parking them in a government-owned fund so that they would not be dumped on the market at distressed prices. With the value of their investments stabilised, banks would then be able to raise equity capital.</narrative>
  <narrative>The idea was fraught with difficulties. The toxic securities in question are not homogenous and in any auction process the sellers are liable to dump the dregs on to the government fund. Moreover, the scheme addresses only one half of the underlying problem--the lack of credit availability. It does very little to enable house owners to meet their mortgage obligations and it does not address the foreclosure problem. With house prices not yet at the bottom, if the government bids up the price of  mortgage backed securities, the taxpayers are liable to lose; but if the government does not pay up, the banking system does not experience much relief and cannot attract equity capital from the private sector.</narrative>
  <narrative>A scheme so heavily favouring Wall Street over Main Street was politically unacceptable. It was tweaked by the Democrats, who hold the upper hand, so that it penalises the financial institutions that seek to take advantage of it. The Republicans did not want to be left behind and imposed a requirement that the tendered securities should be insured against loss at the expense of the tendering institution. The rescue package as it is now constituted is an amalgam of multiple approaches. There is  now a real danger that the asset purchase programme will not be fully utilised because of the onerous conditions attached to it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Nevertheless, a rescue package was desperately needed and, in spite of its  shortcomings, it would change the course of events. As late as last Monday, September 22, Treasury secretary Hank Paulson hoped to avoid using taxpayers' money; that is why he allowed Lehman Brothers to fail. Tarp establishes the principle that public funds are needed and if the present programme does not work, other programmes will be instituted. We will have crossed the Rubicon.</narrative>
  <narrative>Since Tarp was ill-conceived, it is liable to arouse a negative response from America's creditors. They would see it as an attempt to inflate away the debt. The dollar is liable to come under renewed pressure and the government will have to pay more for its debt, especially at the long end. These adverse consequences could be mitigated by using taxpayers' funds more effectively.</narrative>
  <narrative>Instead of just purchasing troubled assets the bulk of the funds ought to be used to recapitalise the banking system. Funds injected at the equity level are more high-powered than funds used at the balance sheet level by a minimal factor of twelve--effectively giving the government $8,400bn to re-ignite the flow of credit. In practice, the effect would be even greater because the injection of government funds would also attract private capital. The result would be more economic recovery and the  chance for taxpayers to profit from the recovery.</narrative>
  <narrative>This is how it would work. The Treasury secretary would rely on bank examiners rather than delegate implementation of Tarp to Wall Street firms. The bank examiners would establish how much additional equity  capital each bank needs in order to be properly capitalised according to existing capital requirements. If managements could not raise equity from the private sector they could turn to Tarp.</narrative>
  <narrative>Tarp would invest in preference shares with warrants attached. The preference shares would carry a low coupon (say 5 per cent) so that banks would find it profitable to continue lending, but shareholders would pay a heavy price because they would be diluted by the warrants; they would be given the right, however, to subscribe on Tarp's terms. The rights would be tradeable and the secretary of the Treasury would be instructed to set the terms so that the rights would have a positive value.</narrative>
  <narrative>Private investors, including me, are likely to jump at the opportunity. The recapitalised banks would be allowed to increase their leverage, so they would resume lending. Limits on bank leverage could be imposed later, after the economy has recovered. If the funds were used in this way, the recapitalisation of the banking system could be achieved with less than $500bn of public funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>A revised emergency legislation could also provide more help to homeowners. It could require the Treasury to provide cheap financing for mortgage securities whose terms have been renegotiated, based on the Treasury's cost of borrowing. Mortgage service companies could be prohibited from charging fees on foreclosures, but they could expect the owners of the securities to provide incentives for renegotiation as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are already doing.</narrative>
  <narrative>Banks deemed to be insolvent would not be eligible for recapitalization by the capital infusion programme, but would be taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC would be recapitalised by $200bn as a temporary measure. FDIC, in turn could remove the $100,000 limit on insured deposits. A revision of the emergency legislation along these lines would be more equitable, have a better chance of success, and cost taxpayers less in the long run.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Rescue Plan: Direct Capital Investments Would Be Better For Both Markets And Taxpayers</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Lucian Bebchuk)</narrative>
  <narrative>Most immediate reactions to the defeat of the emergency legislation in the House of Representatives seem to assume that, facing a choice between approval and government inaction that could bring about a financial meltdown, the House irresponsibly and irrationally opted for the latter. But the defeat of this particular bill hardly leaves us with inaction as the only alternative.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill was defeated at least partly because of its inability to gather sufficient public support due to its evident flaws. Congress can and should adopt quickly a bill that would address these flaws and consequently enjoy strong public support.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is widespread recognition of the depth of the crisis and the need for governmental intervention. Why was the bill nonetheless defeated? Because there is an equally widespread recognition that spending $700 billion on purchasing (and insuring) toxic paper would be a highly flawed form of intervention.</narrative>
  <narrative>During the week preceding the vote, it has become evident that the government's contemplated plans for valuing troubled assets would lead to a quagmire. Opposition to the bill grew due to expectations that purchasing toxic paper could well result in massive complexities, large giveaways, and substantial public losses.</narrative>
  <narrative>At the same time, recognition has grown that, notwithstanding these large costs, the proposed plan would fail to provide the financial sector with capital infusions that would be as immediate, large, and appropriately targeted as needed. Because the bill would provide financial firms with extra capital largely through overpaying for troubled assets (or under-pricing insurance for such assets), it would provide capital only following the consummation of complex and time-consuming processes and  cannot be counted on to supply capital where and when it would be most useful.</narrative>
  <narrative>Suppose that a financial firm runs into trouble, needs a substantial infusion of capital within days, and is viewed by the government as important to save. Even if the rejected bill were in effect at present, it would not provide the government with effective tools to deal with such a situation. For one thing, purchasing the many types of troubled assets the firm may own through the bill's contemplated valuation procedures would require a long delay.</narrative>
  <narrative>Consider the government's recent infusion of capital into AIG. Facing the risk of AIG's collapse, the government provided $85 billion right away and received in return an agreed upon set of debt and equity instruments. Had the bill passed on Monday and AIG subsequently needed assistance, the funds authorised by the bill might not be usable for such capital infusion by the government. Purchasing the large and highly heterogeneous portfolio of troubled assets owned by AIG through valuation processes  would not provide an effective and timely form of intervention.</narrative>
  <narrative>The passage of the defeated bill thus would not have effectively dispelled the financial markets' worries. To do so, Congress should not reconsider the rejected bill but rather pass an authorization for the treasury to infuse capital into financial firms. The same big, market-reassuring number can be used: $700 billion. But the bill, which I expect to obtain wide public support, should focus on and permit direct capital investment of the authorised funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Treasury's direct capital investments should be guided by the objectives of restoring stability to the financial markets and protecting taxpayers. When a firm is solvent and undercapitalised, the Treasury should insist on getting a set of new capital securities that would provide the government with adequate return on its investment.</narrative>
  <narrative>In cases in which a firm is insolvent and not merely undercapitalised, the Treasury should still be permitted to make a capital investment if it views the firm's continued operations as necessary to avoid disruption to the financial markets. Taxpayer losses from the legislation would be limited to such cases, and these losses would be kept to a minimum by the government's investing in such cases only on terms effectively enabling it to take over the firm's equity.</narrative>
  <narrative>It would be perfectly fine for Congress to include authorisation to purchase toxic assets in the adopted legislation. But the bill should not contemplate that such purchases would be a primary form for injecting capital to financial firms, and it should allow such purchases only if they are done at fair market value.</narrative>
  <narrative>Financial markets should be reassured that the Treasury is equipped with the best tools for addressing distress in financial firms and for shoring up these firms' capital. Congress should move quickly to adopt legislation authorizing the use of $700 billion for infusing capital into financial firms. If it does, Monday's defeat of the proposal to spend $700 billion on purchasing toxic paper might turn into a blessing.</narrative>

  <narrative>[From The Nation, Sept. 26, 2008]</narrative>
  <narrative>A Better Bailout</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Joseph E. Stiglitz)</narrative>
  <narrative>The champagne bottle corks were popping as Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced his trillion-dollar bailout for the banks, buying up their toxic mortgages. To a skeptic, Paulson's proposal looks like another of those shell games that Wall Street has honed to a fine art. Wall Street has always made money by slicing, dicing and recombining risk. This "cure" is another one of these rearrangements: somehow, by stripping out the bad assets from the banks and paying fair market value for them,  the value of the banks will soar.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is, however, an alternative explanation for Wall Street's celebration: the banks realized that they were about to get a free ride at taxpayers' expense. No private firm was willing to buy these toxic mortgages at what the seller thought was a reasonable price; they finally had found a sucker who would take them off their hands--called the American taxpayer.</narrative>
  <narrative>The administration attempts to assure us that they will protect the American people by insisting on buying the mortgages at the lowest price at auction. Evidently, Paulson didn't learn the lessons of the information asymmetry that played such a large role in getting us into this mess. The banks will pass on their lousiest mortgages. Paulson may try to assure us that we will hire the best and brightest of Wall Street to make sure that this doesn't happen. (Wall Street firms are already licking  their lips at the prospect of a new source of revenues: fees from the U.S. Treasury.) But even Wall Street's best and brightest do not exactly have a credible record in asset valuation; if they had done better, we wouldn't be where we are. And that assumes that they are really working for the American people, not their long-term employers in financial</narrative>
  <narrative>And for what? In the S&amp;L bailout, taxpayers were already on the hook, with their deposit guarantee. Part of the question then was how to minimize taxpayers' exposure. But not so this time. The objective of the bailout should not be to protect the banks' shareholders, or even their creditors, who facilitated this bad lending. The objective should be to maintain the flow of credit, especially to mortgages. But wasn't that what the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac bailout was supposed to assure us?</narrative>
  <narrative>There are four fundamental problems with our financial system, and the Paulson proposal addresses only one. The first is that the financial institutions have all these toxic products--which they created--and since no one trusts anyone about their value, no one is willing to lend to anyone else. The Paulson approach solves this by passing the risk to us, the taxpayer--and for no return. The second problem is that there is a big and increasing hole in bank balance sheets--banks lent money to people  beyond their ability to repay--and no financial alchemy will fix that. If, as Paulson claims, banks get paid fairly for their lousy mortgages and the complex products in which they are embedded, the hole in their balance sheet will remain. What is needed is a transparent equity injection, not the non-transparent ruse that the administration is proposing.</narrative>
  <narrative>The third problem is that our economy has been supercharged by a housing bubble which  has now burst. The best experts believe that prices still have a way to fall before the return to normal, and that means there will be more foreclosures. No amount of talking up the market is going to change that. The hidden agenda here may be taking large amounts of real estate off the market--and letting it deteriorate at taxpayers' expense.</narrative>
  <narrative>The fourth problem is a lack of trust, a credibility gap. Regrettably, the way the entire financial crisis has been handled has only made that gap larger.</narrative>
  <narrative>Paulson and others in Wall Street are claiming that the bailout is necessary and that we are in deep trouble. Not long ago, they were telling us that we had turned a corner. The administration even turned down an effective stimulus package last February--one that would have included increased unemployment benefits and aid to states and localities--and they still say we don't need another stimulus. To be frank, the administration has a credibility and trust gap as big as that of Wall Street. If  the crisis was as severe as they claim, why didn't they propose a more credible plan? With lack of oversight and transparency the cause of the current problem, how could they make a proposal so short in both? If a quick consensus is required, why not include provisions to stop the source of bleeding, to aid the millions of Americans that are losing their</narrative>
  <narrative>The administration is once again holding a gun at our head, saying, "My way or the highway." We have been bamboozled before by this tactic. We should not let it happen to us again. There are alternatives. Warren Buffet showed the way, in providing equity to Goldman Sachs. The Scandinavian countries showed the way, almost two decades ago. By issuing preferred shares with warrants (options), one reduces the public's downside risk and insures that they participate in some of the upside potential.  This approach is not only proven, it provides both incentives and wherewithal to resume lending. It furthermore avoids the hopeless task of trying to value millions of complex mortgages and even more complex products in which they are embedded, and it deals with the "lemons" problem--the government getting stuck with the worst or most overpriced assets.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, we need to impose a special financial sector tax to pay for the bailouts conducted so far. We also need to create a reserve fund so that poor taxpayers won't have to be called upon again to finance Wall Street's foolishness.</narrative>
  <narrative>If we design the right bailout, it won't lead to an increase in our long-term debt--we might even make a profit. But if we implement the wrong strategy, there is a serious risk that our national debt--already overburdened from a failed war and eight years of fiscal profligacy--will soar, and future living standards will be compromised. The president seemed to think that his new shell game will arrest the decline in house prices, and we won't be faced holding a lot of bad mortgages. I hope he's  right, but I wouldn't count on it: it's not what most housing experts say. The president's economic credentials are hardly stellar. Our national debt has already climbed from $5.7 trillion to over $9 trillion in eight years, and the deficits for 2008 and 2009--not including the bailouts--are expected to reach new heights. There is no such thing as a free war--and no such thing as a free bailout. The bill will be paid, in one way or another.</narrative>
  <narrative>Perhaps by the time this article is published, the administration and Congress will have reached an agreement. No politician wants to be accused of being responsible for the next Great Depression by blocking key legislation. By all accounts, the compromise will be far better than the bill originally proposed by Paulson but still far short of what I have outlined should be done. No one expects them to address the underlying causes of the problem: the spirit of excessive deregulation that the Bush  Administration so promoted. Almost surely, there will be plenty of work to be done by the next president and the next Congress. It would be better if we got it right the first time, but that is expecting too much of this president and his administration.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman of financial services Barney Frank  for bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor. I also rise with a sense of the solemnity of this moment. However, I rise today with the confidence that our system of government is strong and the constitutional protections of the full faith and credit of our government must protect Main Street America while we reform America's Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first three articles of the United States Constitution address the three branches of government and their enumerated powers. These articles govern the legislature, the executive, and the judicial branches. Because there is no specific grant of constitutional authority for the actions that will be taking place here today, we the members of Congress need to exercise oversight over the powers and actions of the executive. Should the executive or its agencies exceed the powers granted to it in  the Constitution, the judicial can review the determinations made by the executive and the legislative branches. These concepts are fundamental to our Constitution and our system of constitutional checks and balances. These checks and balances were established by the Founding Fathers to reign in the unbridled power of the executive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are engaged in a fundamental exercise of the constitutional powers extended to the Congress. Today's vote is critically important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several questions come to mind when I consider the present financial crisis:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where was the FDIC?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where was the SEC?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where was the Federal Reserve?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with leadership to offer consistent amendments, not once but twice unsuccessfully, that would have strengthened the enforcement measures over the past week to change the Administration's proposal to make it more encompassing, effective, and better for the American people. While the present legislation is impressive, it is also impressive regarding what needs clarification in the present legislation. For example, the legislation needs clarification on its bankruptcy restructuring;  enforcement; and judicial review. These are all issues that I have been very concerned about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I am concerned and desire that the maximum number of Americans get relief from this bill, I offered amendments yesterday. To ensure that this bill provides relief for Americans, I offered the following amendments:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, many are concerned about the dollar amount that will be set aside for those individuals facing mortgage foreclosure. Therefore, I asked that language be inserted into the bill so that $10 billion be utilized for the Secretary of the Treasury to restructure mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, as Senator Barack Obama has recently stated, he is committed to altering the Bankruptcy Code in the future to assist homeowners on the question of restructuring their mortgages. Therefore, I believe that there should have been Sense of Congress language that the Congress should review and amend the Bankruptcy Code to permit bankruptcy judges to address the question of individual home mortgage restructuring. This would have sent a clear message that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress is interested in helping Americans pay off their debt despite its not changing the Bankruptcy Code at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, there needs to be greater enforcement. In the section on judicial review (section 119), there should have been language that specifically states that "the courts should be able to exercise their discretion to grant injunctive and/or equitable relief if the court determines that such relief would not destabilize financial markets."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the legislation should have created a new, independent commission to exercise oversight over what happened and the commission should regularly provide reports to Congress. This Commission would be backward looking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, the legislation should have been narrowly crafted so that corporate executives who may be convicted of criminal malfeasance in the financial sector might be barred from conducting financial business with the government for a period of seven (7) years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixth, the legislation should have permanently lifted the present insurance cap of $100,000 that the FDIC has established to insure funds stored in FDIC-backed banking institutions to $250,000. I believe that this has already been included in the Senate bill; but, my amendment would have made the change permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighth, in section 109, which addresses "foreclosure mitigation efforts," the language should be changed from "shall encourage" to "shall require" to provide stronger relief for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, current section 109(a) states in pertinent part that "the Secretary shall implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and use the authority of the Secretary to encourage the servicers of the underlying mortgages ..... to minimize foreclosures." I believe if the true intent is to bailout "Main Street," the Secretary should be "required" to minimize foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can you clarify how this legislation has any enforcement? I understand that <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Board in section 104; Oversight and Audits in section 116; and a Congressional Oversight Panel in section 125. However, none of these sections appear to provide penalties or sanctions for non-compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I intend to have the following questions answered:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can you explain why the bankruptcy provisions were removed from the bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without bankruptcy I offered an amendment that $10 billion dollars should be set aside so that the Department of Treasury could use those funds to address the question of individuals facing home mortgage foreclosure. I considered it important to set aside money because I wanted to ensure that Main Street received something from this bailout and not just Wall Street. Can you explain what provisions  in the bill would ensure that  the monies are spent on persons in mortgage foreclosure?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can we add report language indicating to the Secretary how monies are to be used when it comes to Americans in mortgage foreclosure and can we add language that the Secretary should attempt to restructure the mortgages of homeowners that are in mortgage foreclosure?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration has labeled the current economic situation as a crisis that requires emergency measures. Because these are "exigent" circumstances that are in need of correction, what in the bill prevents the Secretary from using all the $350 billion by January 2009?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, my concern is to ensure that the American people receive the relief that they deserve. If the American people are facing mortgage foreclosure, it is my desire that monies be provided to them so that they can continue to stay in their home and pay their mortgages and their bills. Everyone deserves the economic dream of owning their own home. But the financial institutions were dilatory in their responsibility to assess the borrower's ability to pay for loans  and purchase a home. It was the squandering of this responsibility and preoccupation with greed and avarice that has led us to where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are substantial improvements in the present version of the bill compared to the Bush administration proposal. However, the bill as it is presently written, in my view needs some clarification as to how it provides the necessary relief to middle-class America. Frankly, the bill provides no panacea to our present economic woes. Our markets will have the full faith and credit of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are provisions now that address accountability measures by requiring a plan to ensure the taxpayer is repaid in full, and requiring Congressional review after the first $350 billion for future payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Principally, there are three phases of a financial rescue with strong taxpayer protections: reinvest, reimburse, and reform. One of the phases is to re-invest in the troubled financial markets to stabilize the markets. Another, reimburses the taxpayer and requires a plan to guarantee that they will be repaid in full. The last is to reform how business is done on Wall Street. The current legislation provides for fewer golden parachutes and, to its credit, provides sweeping Congressional oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are critical improvements to the rescue plan that yield greater protection to the American taxpayers and even to Main Street. However, with a "pause" we can help the financial markets and make America secure. I still have concern that there is enough in the bill to help Americans struggling with their mortgages. Is there some bright hope you can share with me to relieve me of my anxiety?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank, on many occasions, you have reiterated the concern of the American people, which we both share, the wish that this legislation had stronger and more comprehensive relief for home owners facing foreclosures. Please elaborate on your interest, willingness, and commitment for us to work together to introduce and pass stronger and more comprehensive housing foreclosure legislation in the next Congress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to you and your staff, for your commitment to this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly two weeks ago the President presented legislation to Congress requesting a $700 billion recovery package, with the Treasury Secretary empowered to set the rules for all transactions. The bill included no safeguards, no transparency, no accountability, and no oversight. This plan was wrong for the American people and we rejected it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House, through bipartisan negotiations, completely reshaped the bill to include three crucial elements to rebuild our financial system. One, we reinvested in troubled financial markets to stabilize our economy and insulate Main Street from Wall Street. Two, we guaranteed that the taxpayer will be first in line to be reimbursed through ownership shares and asset recovery as the plan begins to work. Finally, the bill reformed how business is done on Wall Street including the prohibition of  golden parachutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I voted for the bill, it failed to gather the necessary votes for it to pass. Following the vote I returned home this week and saw, not only in my District, but all over the country, the negative effects of our continued inaction. Already, our commercial and consumer credit markets are drying up and if we continue to do nothing, the ability for my constituents to obtain home mortgages, car loans, student loans, loans for small businesses, or even credit cards will become highly difficult  or impossible. Even more financial institutions and businesses could fail and millions could lose their pensions and retirement savings, thousands of jobs could be lost, and large parts of our economy could cease to function. The repercussions would be far greater than the cost of a financial rescue program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only have small businesses and families felt the effect of the credit crunch, my home state of California is feeling it. According to our State Treasurer, Bill Lockyer, this current crisis threatens to deplete California's cash reserves. Without those reserves the state will be unable to pay teachers, first responders, or nursing care workers. Additionally, he thinks without action the state, "..... will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for highway construction, schools, and housing  or water projects." If we don't pass this bill the effects will almost immediately be felt throughout the country and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> includes strong independent oversight and transparency through an establishment of an independent bipartisan board to provide oversight, review and accountability of taxpayer funds. The Government Accountability Office will have a presence at Treasury to oversee the program and conduct audits to ensure strong internal controls, and to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. There will be an independent Inspector General to monitor the Treasury Secretary's decisions in regard to this program  and all transactions will be posted online for the public to review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than giving the Treasury all the funds at once, the legislation gives the Treasury $250 billion immediately, then requires the President to certify that additional funds are needed ($100 billion, then $350 billion, subject to Congressional disapproval) and there are limits on golden parachutes for executives whose companies participate in the program. We will help homeowners by allowing the government to change the terms of mortgages to help reduce the 2 million projected foreclosures  in the next year. It will also assist school districts, cities and counties who held investments in failed institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill temporarily raises the FDIC insurance cap to $250,000 from $100,000. It also includes three additional pieces of legislation that are critical to the health of our economy and our constituents. This legislation will extend tax credits and incentives that are important to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. It extends tax benefits to the renewable energy industry. Solar and wind energy, fuel cells, and biofuels are but a few of the technologies that will benefit from the legislation  that we are considering today, and they will all play a role in our nation's energy future. While I remain committed to totally eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, this bill includes a "one-year fix" that will prevent an additional 25 million American taxpayers from being subject to the AMT on their 2008 tax returns and it will reduce</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vote I took earlier this week was as tough as any I've ever taken during my time in Congress and today's vote will not be any easier. I will vote "yes" because I believe it's the right thing do for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe doing nothing is a higher risk to our country and would hurt millions of Americans across the nation. I didn't come to Congress to hurt people. My "yes" vote is to help restore confidence in our economy, help move the country move forward, protect taxpayers, help Main Street, protect pensions, protect 401Ks, and restore our credit markets and, with no rewards for those whose greed and foolishness have so jeopardized our economy.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill we are considering today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week marks a critical point in our Nation's history for a number of reasons, but none more important than redefining the appropriate role for government in our market system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that we must stabilize our financial markets as quickly as possible. But, in my view, asking cash-strapped Americans to pay more than $700 billion to bail out an industry, some of whom were reckless, is just wrong and sets a dangerous precedent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a targeted approach to respond to this crisis. One that provides those troubled institutions with the capital they need to start lending again. Yet, we also need standards in place to hold these institutions accountable to prevent this crisis from repeating itself in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> sets government on a new and dangerous course. Gone are the days of personal responsibility. Gone are the days where executives are held responsible for bad decisions. Gone are the days when the market determines success or failure. After today, taxpayers will be responsible for everyone's decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally disturbing, in my view, is the fact that this legislation makes no substantive reforms to prevent a repeat of what caused this financial meltdown in the first place. Last fall, the House passed, with my full support, <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act. This would have been an important step towards bringing more restraint and oversight to the lending industry. Unfortunately the Senate took no action so it never became law. Are those important reforms in this  bill? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a duty to the hardworking families who act responsibly on a daily basis to be prudent with their tax dollars. I remain unconvinced that the bill we are considering today fulfills this obligation. That's why I'll be voting no.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will be voting no on this bill. I recently read in the press that 8 out of 10 of my colleagues know nothing about economics or banking. This bill shows that account is quite right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does nothing but bail out Wall Street and large corporate America. It spends $800 billion that taxpayers will end up having to pay for and it does nothing for middle-income Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is there a crisis in this country? Yes there is. But this is not the solution for those people who have been working and trying to pay their bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is not a crisis facing your average community bank which has no problem in liquidity. There is not a crisis for your credit cards--endangering their ability to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rushed bailout package is nothing more than President Bush's Treasury Secretary Paulson's way to scare us as Colin Powell tried to scare us some years ago by saying if we didn't vote for an ill-conceived war, we'd see terrorists on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You're getting the same kind of misinformation now--the same kind of rush to judgment--to tell you that a crisis will occur. It won't. Vote no, and let's come back and help work on a bill that will help all Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400282" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of taking action to help community banks, which are an important part of our financial landscape, in Kansas and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the lessons learned from the current financial crisis is that financial institutions that rely on core deposits are in the best position to weather a financial storm. One thing banking regulators can do to help banks attract and retain more core deposits is to recognize that certain deposits that may technically be considered as "brokered" nevertheless function like core deposits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This situation occurs, for instance, when insured depository institutions exchange funds, dollar-for-dollar, with members of a group of insured depository institutions, where each member of the group sets the interest rate to be paid on the entire amount of funds it places with other group members. Such an arrangement enables a member of the group to offer its customers a convenient means to obtain access to FDIC insurance on large deposits by working solely with the bank with whom the customer  has a relationship. As a result, the bank is able to accept the large deposits without having to post collateral, which in turn makes more funds available to meet the credit needs of the bank's community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regulators could take several constructive steps within the current law governing brokered deposits. First, the FDIC could permit banks that become adequately capitalized (and therefore need a waiver from the FDIC to accept brokered deposits) to continue accepting funding through the arrangement described above while a waiver request is pending. Second, the FDIC could recognize that such finding is stable and should be permitted as a general matter when the FDIC reviews a waiver request. Third,  it would be appropriate for the FDIC to exclude such funding from the category of "brokered deposits" if the FDIC elects to charge a bank a higher insurance premium due a heavy reliance on brokered deposits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the FDIC were to take these steps, banks--and, in particular, community banks--would be in a better position to attract and retain large deposits, thereby providing additional liquidity that the banks can use to make loans that are so vitally needed by our Nation's communities.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400127" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the years since I was first sworn in to office in 1993, our Nation has faced a number of major challenges that required tough and courageous decisions. I have always believed public service to be the noblest of calling. I still believe in the concept of "citizen statesmen" as envisioned by our Founding Fathers who recognized that private citizens motivated to serve in Congress were vital to the future of our Nation. I came to Washington not as a politician, but  as a businessman ready to make tough votes for the good of the country. I believe my final vote to pass the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is such a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of nearly a decade of granting home loans that were doomed to fail has reached a crisis point in our economy. The combined weight of hundred of billions of dollars in low value mortgages has created an economic aneurysm that is beginning to burst and usher in the collapse of our financial markets and take with it many American jobs. The national media have repeatedly spun this dilemma as one that solely afflicts "Wall Street." This is simply not accurate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans believe this is a cry of Chicken Little and that it is not their problem, and we should let the markets fail and let the consequences fall as they may. However, if we allow our markets to fail--no one will be insulated from the impact. Our whole economy is underpinned by the availability of credit. Without access to credit, banks fail, businesses are forced to layoff workers or close altogether, and even people with good credit cannot get loans for cars, college, new homes, or  other essential needs. We are already seeing that universities are having trouble accessing their funds, municipalities are experiencing losses in property taxes since mortgage banks can not pay on foreclosed homes, and lack of availability of bonds for infrastructure and other local needs. Soon our farmers</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a conservative Republican, I believe in a free market and less government intervention. However, these are extraordinary circumstances that will impact all of us. Many Americans might not have felt the effects directly yet and hopefully they will not because of the action being taken today. This legislation includes safeguards to protect taxpayers, not making the total amount of funds available at once, ensuring that there are no golden parachutes, and holding executives accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot leave office taking any position that is counter to the best interest of our Nation. I would have preferred to not have the Federal Government intervention, but failure to act to shore up our economy would allow far greater damage to millions of average Americans and hundreds of thousands of Alabamians. I have been honored to serve the Second District these 16 years and would never have thought one of my last votes in Congress would have been on this type of legislation. Very few things  are easy in politics, and I have thought long and hard on this difficult issue, and I believe that voting in favor of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is the necessary thing to do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is one of the most difficult and complex issues I have had to deal with in my 8 years in Congress. I am proud of my no vote on Monday against the original rescue plan. My no vote enabled me to push this legislation forward towards an improved and positive bill. This is a different bill. It is an improved bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have pushed as far as I can and we are at the point where the only two directions we can go from here are backwards or nothing. Neither is an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share the anger of my constituents that we have been forced into this economic crisis by Wall Street greed and irresponsible lending by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But we cannot let our anger cloud our judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 5 days, I have been hearing from more and more of my constituents who are beginning to feel the pain of the economic crisis we are entering. I am convinced that my constituents will feel that pain grow if we do not act, and that pain will be felt in job losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I have decided to support this economic recovery effort. Make no mistake, this bill is a far better deal for American taxpayers than what was originally brought to the House floor. My colleagues and I fought hard to include additional taxpayer and market driven protections that will restore trust in our banks, including raising the FDIC insurance limit to protect my constituents' bank accounts. My vote is the right decision for my constituents and America, not for political popularity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to quote Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, author of this bailout bill, "The free market failed, it's up to government to fix the problem."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we understand the how we got here in order to address a solution to the problem. Who and what caused the subprime bubbles and the current economic crisis?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treasury Secretary Alan Greenspan in 2005 said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "continue to grow ..... they potentially create ever-growing potential systemic risk down the road ..... we are placing the total financial system of the future at substantial risk."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a Financial Services Committee legislative markup on May 24, 2005, the Hensarling/Feeney Amendment was offered to protect taxpayers from crushing bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Hensarling/Feeney Amendment established a new regulator to:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) repeal the Congressional charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) create a bank-like secondary mortgage market, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) establish new charters for limited purpose mortgage securitization entities that could be auctioned off competitively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted YES but the Democrats unanimously voted NO and killed reform and taxpayer protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leading Democrat Barney Frank said in 2003:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two entities--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--are not facing any kind of financial crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After billions in accounting scandals at both Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac, Barney Frank said in 2004:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't see anything in your report that raises safety and soundness problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen nothing in here that suggests the safety and soundness are an issue. And, I think it serves us badly to raise safety and soundness as kind of a general [inaudible] when it does not seem to be an issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic leader Maxine Waters said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through nearly a dozen hearings that we were, frankly, trying to fix something that wasn't broke. Mr. Chairman we do not have a crisis at Freddie Mac, and in particular Fannie Mae under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Frank Rains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also voted in 2005 to cut off a $2 billion line of credit from U.S. taxpayers to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the same people who protected the corrupt and out-of-control Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are proposing a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street speculators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barney Frank and other Democratic leaders revised the Community Reinvestment Act in 1995, forcing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and all American lenders to make risky loans to people in poor communities. Loans were given regardless of the borrower's ability to pay!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, ACORN, a corrupt left wing "community group" engaged in extensive voter registration fraud across this country, was given taxpayer money to extort banks and lenders into making more bad loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayer money was used to browbeat lenders to make non-creditworthy loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the economic credit crisis began, we were told by Secretary Paulson and Barney Frank that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. The $152 billion "stimulus" package would resolve the American economic problem. (I predicted it is a silly "rain dance," having no long term stimulus)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The Bear Stearns taxpayer bailout would resolve the credit crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. The Fannie/Freddie bailout in July would totally resolve the financial crisis and the U.S. Treasury would not have to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (I voted no and predict bigger problems for America)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. The federal government takeover of AIG, the largest insurer in America, would end this global crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current $700 billion bailout, touted by Treasury Secretary Paulson and Chairman Barney Frank, fixes none of the fundamental structural problems the federal government is responsible for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buying troubled assets on Wall Street balance sheets does NOT stimulate American banks on Main Street in Central Florida to increase lending and credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It adds short term money, which banks will HOARD, as they are required to increase reserves and make fewer loans to healthy consumers and businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does NOT privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does not repeal the community Reinvestment Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It creates a huge new bureaucracy which may control lending in America and become the largest leap toward socialism in my lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we must do (now or later) to save American freedom and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Stop naked short selling of bank stocks--Predatory investors, including foreigners, sell stocks they don't own to drive down the price of the stock, which they can later buy cheaper and profit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This kills bank equity and forces banks to stop making loans in order to meet material reserve requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Guarantee bank deposits in excess of $100,000 and bank creditors--This will bolster bank share prices and lead to more immediate lending to families and small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. Issue guaranteed network certificates in exchange for bank promissory notes--This will get banks to save lending restrictions and give them time to work through the real estate mess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. End "mark to market" accounting rules--Banks and institutions that hold packages of securitized mortgages cannot sell those packages because in this environment there are NO buyers. But those mortgages are secured by real estate worth some value, even if it is not 100 percent of the loan value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These mortgages are not worth zero, just because there is no market to buy them during this crisis. Banks have to count such mortgage holdings as ZERO asset reserves. Every dollar a bank counts as reserves would result in $10 in lending ability today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark these assets at "fair market value."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. Jump start private purchase of mortgage securities--Don't buy $700 billion in troubled mortgage securities with taxpayer money. have an auction for private investors using private money to make such purchasers. To start buyer activity, grant buyers a zero percent capital gains tax--not the 28 percent tax Senator Obama proposes, but 0 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most mortgages will be purchased without any taxpayer exposure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. Establish a privately funded insurance model for mortgage backed securities--Holders of these securities would pay risk-based premiums to fully fund a guarantee of asset values, without taxpayer exposure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>7. Unleash the American Economy--Immediately pass comprehensive energy policy that will put hundreds of billions of dollars into the American economy overnight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should pass free trade legislation including agreements with Columbia, Panama, and South Korea to help American exporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without delay, Congress should kill the built-in Democrat tax increases which are scheduled to raise taxes on Florida families by $3,040 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Paulson/Frank bailout bill raises the Federal Government's debt to $11.3 trillion--a 26 percent increase. In the less than two years Democrats have controlled Congress, the national debt has jumped over $8,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Can we afford two more years of that behavior?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are meeting today to again consider the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act--a critical piece of legislation, but one that none of us look forward to voting on. During this difficult economic crisis, I am proud of this Congress for coming together at a crucial moment to reach a bipartisan compromise to rescue not only our financial markets but our entire economy. However, no one is celebrating today about the tough decisions that had to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last two weeks hundreds of Rhode Islanders have contacted my office expressing serious concerns about the proposal and a firm belief that the taxpayers' needs must be a priority. I share their anger and frustration that for far too long, many on Wall Street were given carte blanche to make increasingly risky investments--investments which, in some cases, the firms themselves didn't even fully understand. There is plenty of blame to go around, from Wall Street and mortgage lenders to  government regulators and Congress. Unfortunately, the actions of these firms do not take place in a bubble: they are inextricably linked to the every day transactions of every day American families. Our economy is in dire shape and drastic action is needed. If we do not act now, a domino effect could easily trigger major job losses and a significant period of economic downturn with negative consequences not just on Wall Street, but on every street in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This crisis originated with faulty lending practices and the creation of subprime mortgages made to people who often could not afford to pay them back. These subprime mortgages were then pooled together into packages that were transformed into highly-rated securities purchased around the world. The eventual collapse of the subprime mortgage market infected the prime mortgage market, which in turn poisoned the entire financial system. In response, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson proposed a plan  under which the Federal Government would buy--at a deep discount--so-called "toxic" assets, which currently no one is willing to buy. These assets include home mortgages which have been bundled into such complex packages that there is great uncertainty about their underlying value. Secretary Paulson considers these purchases to be investments by the federal government, which could return a substantial proportion of their value to American taxpayers once the market has settle down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the urgency of the situation and understand that Secretary Paulson and all responsible government leaders are trying to ward off even worse outcomes. This year, we have seen the fall of some of the largest investment banks in the world--Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch--and the last two standing--Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs--last week</paragraph>
    <paragraph>chose to be switched over to commercial banks, seeking greater protection at the price of greater regulation. Meanwhile, the federal government loaned $85 billion to American International Group, Inc., AIG, the 18th largest company in the world, when it was unable to access credit for its daily operations. On September 26, we also saw the biggest bank failure in our country's history when Washington Mutual collapsed. One week later, Wachovia had been bought out by another bank. Even Bank of America  recently decided it would no longer extend new lines of credit to McDonald's franchisees, which have been turning a profit for years and run a clean balance sheet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the credit market seizes up at the highest levels, it is not just a problem for Wall  Street. It quickly impacts all of us, making it harder for average families to secure car loans, home loans or mortgage refinancing. It means that small business owners can't access the quick capital they need to make payroll or invest in their companies. It impacts the student loan market, where more than 50 firms have abandoned or cut back their student loan  programs. And it threatens the pensions and savings that our retirees are counting on. While no one wanted to be in this position, I do believe that passing this rescue plan is essential for Rhode Island families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I have been vocal about my own concerns with the Administration's original proposal, and early on I outlined priorities that must be included in any bill I would be able to support. I am pleased that the legislation before us today is a vast improvement over the initial plan Secretary Paulson presented, and it contains significant protections for families across the country who had nothing to do with creating this crisis but are feeling its effects in many ways. First, this bill protects  taxpayers by requiring strong Congressional oversight over expenditures under the plan; giving taxpayers a share of profits in participating companies; and requiring a President to ensure taxpayers are repaid in full, with Wall Street making up any difference. Furthermore, we have endured that CEOs do not benefit from</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At its core, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> authorizes $700 billion for the Treasury Department to buy distressed mortgage-backed securities, expiring on December 31, 2009. Of that total, $250 billion would be for immediate release, with another $100 billion upon a presidential certification of need. The final $350 billion could be made available if the president transmits a written report to Congress requesting the funds, and Congress would have the right to disapprove this last installment. Spending authority would  be overseen by a new Financial Stability Oversight Board, which will review the Treasury Department's actions and its effects on the financial markets and the housing market, and by a special inspector general office to conduct and supervise audits and investigations of the actions taken under this bill. Treasury must also report to Congress 60 days after it begins using this authority, and every 30 days thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> establishes a joint congressional oversight panel to review the current state of the financial markets and the regulatory system. This panel will submit a report on the current regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and protecting consumers. This provision is critical, since going forward, we must ensure that our financial sector is no longer allowed to put ordinary Americans in danger by pursuing high-risk behavior  with little to no oversight. We must investigate companies that took advantage of lenient regulation or possibly acted outside of federal regulations entirely. And we must learn from our mistakes, establishing new regulations and ensuring the laws already on the books are enforced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in just the four days since the House defeated the original economic recovery bill, we have already seen clear signs of what awaits our country if we do not take action today. Within hours after that first vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 800 points, its biggest point drop in history. The markets have remained shaky, threatening the financial holdings and retirement savings of millions of American families. Meanwhile, anxiety continues to rise in industries across  the country, from agriculture to manufacturing. Countless businesses, small and large, are having trouble securing credit for everyday operations and they are terrified of what the future might hold. Car loans are becoming more expensive, mortgages more difficult to obtain. And on Monday, Wachovia limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges and universities to their own funds invested with the bank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are troubling warning signals of the potential for real economic catastrophe if we do not come together as a Congress and show the real leadership on difficult issues that our constituents expect. This is not an easy vote for any of us, but I am convinced that it is the right one. I know it is not a perfect bill, but rarely is there a perfect solution to such a complex and troubling set of problems. I believe the revised measure before us today is somewhat improved over the original version,  largely due to the inclusion of an increase in FDIC coverage for bank accounts from $100,000 to $250,000. Unfortunately, I am disappointed that the tax extenders legislation--which I was happy to support when its costs were fully paid for--has been added to this bill without sufficient offsets. Nonetheless, I will again cast a vote in favor of this package because it is too important to fail again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me close by assuring my colleagues and my constituents that if I thought the bill before us today was nothing more than a hand-out to high-flying Wall Street investors who suddenly found themselves in trouble and decided they didn't like losing money, I would be the first in line to cast a no vote. Unfortunately, this problem is much bigger and much less selective about whom it might hurt. We need to take action, and we need to do it now. This legislation represents a good,  bipartisan solution to a situation none of us wanted to find ourselves in. I want to thank speaker Pelosi, Chairman Frank and many other colleagues for their tireless work on this bill. I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>. I want to commend Chairman Barney Frank of the Financial Services Committee for his hard work, leadership, insight, and guidance throughout this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress and Senate did not come to the decision of supporting this legislation lightly. All of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle participated in numerous Caucus meetings and conference calls with Secretary Paulson, and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke. We took into consideration the views of renowned economists, and we considered numerous legislative proposals. After much deliberation we came to the conclusion that this legislation was the best bipartisan effort to contain strict  oversight to prevent repeating this crisis, limit executive compensation, initiate provisions for mortgage stabilization, and ensure protections that taxpayers deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a rescue plan. Main Street is hurting because small businesses do not have access to credit, which they depend on to cover the cost of their daily operations, including payroll. Likewise parents and students cannot get student loans, so it is clear that the financial crisis is hitting every street corner in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps what has been lost in this debate is the effect that this crisis has had on our municipalities and local governments. Many of these municipalities and local governments had their investments tied to these Wall Street institutions. In California public entities have at least $300 million at stake; in fact San Mateo has lost $150 million. If our local governments fail, they will not be able to provide the most basic services (i.e.--police &amp; fire services, trash collection, and education).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that this is a difficult decision for many of my colleagues. Historians have said these are dire times only second to the Great Depression. I urge my colleagues to act now, and support this critical piece of legislation that will stabilize our residential neighborhoods, small businesses across this country and our economy.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400082" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, four days ago I voted against the historic $700 billion bailout legislation proposed by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson. It seemed clear to me that the message sent by that bill's defeat was that we needed to slow and consider other alternatives to deal with the problems facing our economy. Numerous professional economists and other experts, including William Isaac, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, have said that we could  provide the confidence the credit markets need in other, less expensive ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunagtely, that message fell on deaf ears. The Senate leadership took the Bush/Paulson proposal and added $100 billion in tax breaks and other so-called incentives. While I do support expanding FDIC insurance limits to $250,000, I do not see how making a $700 billion bill an $800 billion bill benefits our economy. What these additions cannot do is hide the fact that at its core, this bill is the same as the one the House rejected Monday, and I will vote against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I understand that many Americans are uneasy about the state of our economy. I share their anxiety. But I am equally anxious about the long-term ramifications of this legislation. I think it is highly possible that this bill will make our economic problems worse in the long run. While we should take action, we should act prudently and with a thorough review of our options. We have failed to do this, and I cannot vote to expend $800 billion in taxpayer dollars without absolute confidence  in the course being taken. I will again vote no.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the Senate. Today, the United States faces the most significant financial crisis since the Great Depression. Homeowners, small businesses, retirement savings plans, and community banks--American people from every walk of life--are put at risk by the turbulence in our financial sector. This bill puts us on the right path to recovery for our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there was any question whether action is necessary, one needs to look no further than  the stock market reaction to Congress' inaction on Monday. Leading up to that vote, I spoke with the leaders of some of North Carolina's local and state banks and credit unions about the effect of this crisis on the communities they serve. While I wish that this action was unnecessary, the financial system's problems call for strong steps. If lending does not resume,  Americans will be unable to grow their small business, buy a car, pay for college, or buy a home. Without action, this financial crisis will threaten the entire American economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the bill we voted on earlier this week, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> is a vast improvement over the blank check that the Bush Administration originally proposed. This bill contains key provisions, negotiated by Democratic leaders in Congress, to ensure this bill benefits Main Street. As I demanded when an economic recovery plan was first proposed, this bill protects taxpayer money, provides help for struggling homeowners, prevents Wall Street CEOs from gaining a windfall at taxpayer expense, and provides the  accountability and oversight that have been missing. While it contains strict oversight provisions, the plan also contains the flexibility needed to address a problem of this magnitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, this plan protects taxpayer money. Democratic leaders made sure that the public will share in the benefit of the economic relief provided by adding provisions that allow taxpayers to share in profits if a financial institution we invest in grows healthy in the future. To ensure Main Street is not left with the bill for Wall Street's problems, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> calls for a plan to require financial institutions to repay any losses to the government in the future. I am also pleased  that this bill now temporarily increases the amount of money insured by the Federal Insurance Corporation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>from $100,000 to $250,000 for one year. This provision insures taxpayers' savings and boosts public confidence in our banks. Finally, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> looks after the taxpayers bottom line by requiring that any profit resulting from this plan be used to reduce the growing national debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to further ensure that assistance benefits Main Street, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will help ensure those who have been hurt by the economic downturn and predatory lending practices can remain in their homes when possible. The bill authorizes new loan guarantees and credit enhancement to prevent foreclosures, and requires a plan to encourage mortgage servicers to modify loans through the Federal Housing Administration's Hope for Homeowners and other initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> makes sure that Wall Street executives do not profit excessively from the government assistance provided. It includes limits on executive compensation and golden parachutes not only for institutions that the government buys, but also for those holding loans that are supported by this bill. It holds executives accountable for statements they have made about their company's financial strength, forcing those promise gains that later turn out to be false or inaccurate to repay the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has also increased oversight and transparency in this bill. Rather than providing $700 billion in one lump sum, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> authorizes an initial $250 billion so that we can see how the plan works. Another $100 billion is available with Presidential notification, and the remaining $350 billion requires Congressional action to be released. <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> requires public disclosure, within two days, of purchases made by the Secretary, and provides a strong oversight board with authority over  the Treasury Secretary's actions. Additionally, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> establishes an independent Inspector General to monitor the use of the Secretary's actions. Additionally, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> establishes an independent Inspector General to monitor the use of the Secretary's authority. Given the extent and range of the problems in our financial markets, it is critical that the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 also provides tax relief for millions of Americans while spurring business investment and innovation in renewable energy. While we support the financial system that enables our families and businesses to grow, we should also address the tax burden they face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> includes critical tax relief for families facing the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. The AMT was originally intended to ensure that the nation's wealthiest taxpayers were not able to avoid paying taxes altogether. However, because the AMT is not indexed for inflation, today millions of middle income Americans who pay their taxes as required would see a huge tax increase. <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> raises the exemption limits and protects 25 million middle-class families across the country, including more  than 30,000 taxpayers in my district, from this extra tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will benefit the families of millions of children by expanding the child tax credit to those earning $8,500 a year in 2009. This bill also helps families by extending the state and local sales tax deduction, and will help over 4 million families better afford college by providing a tuition deduction. As a former superintendent of schools, I am pleased that this legislation includes a tax deduction that will save money for more than 3 million teachers  when they pay for classroom supplies and expenses. The bill also includes an additional $400 million for Quality Zone Academy Bonds to help states and localities address school construction and renovation needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides critical support in the form of tax breaks and incentives to the small businesses that form the backbone of our economy. This bill extends the Research and Development Tax Credit for two years to spur American innovation and business investment as well as a two year extension of the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for leasehold improvements and qualified restaurant improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing alternative energy sources and reducing our dependence on foreign oil is one the most critical challenges facing our country. <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> will increase the production of renewable fuels and renewable electricity, and encourage greater energy efficiency. This bill features an eight-year extension of the investment tax credit for solar energy and a multi-year extension of the production tax credit for other sources of alternative energy like biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and solid waste.  With millions of Americans struggling to afford rising gas prices, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> includes tax incentives for the installation of E-85 pumps for flex-fuel vehicles, and a $3,000 tax credit toward the purchase of fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrid vehicles. There are also incentives for incorporating</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> contains language I have supported to expand access to mental health care for all Americans. My home state of North Carolina was one of the first states to adopt a mental health parity law back in 1991, and last year the State Legislature expanded and strengthened its mental health parity provisions. I support the efforts of North Carolina's mental health professionals in bringing this issue to the forefront of our State's agenda, and I am pleased that we are following suit  today in passing this bill. <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill> simply requires those insurers or group health plans who do chose to cover mental health to do so on an equal basis with other covered health needs. This will ensure that those in need can get the treatment that is medically necessary, without creating an undue hardship on employers or insurers. As health care consumes an increasing percentage of America's income, it is critical that we provide support for all medical needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 as amended by the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, amid the sharp debate over the Emergency Economic Stabilization Bill being considered this week in Congress we have heard dire predictions from both extremes warning of a financial Armageddon if we don't approve the bill or of squandering billions of taxpayer dollars if we do. Beyond the intense rhetoric though, there is a growing body of evidence of serious impacts in every American community this month as the shrinking credit market has already affected consumers'  ability to buy cars, purchase inventory for their businesses, afford college loans, and obtain home mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's only going to get worse until Congress takes some action that will have a direct effect on the credit markets and on our confidence in the integrity of the U.S. banking system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately in the search for an appropriate remedy, I fear that "perfect" may have become the enemy of "good." Warren Buffet put it bluntly in an interview when he was asked his opinion of the legislation we're considering this week. He said "I don't think it's perfect, but I don't know that I could draw one that's perfect. I would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. And it would be precisely wrong to turn it down."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gallup poll conducted this week for USA TODAY indicated that more than half of all Americans--56 percent--say their financial situation has already been harmed by the financial meltdown of the 2 weeks, with 20 percent of our population saying they have been seriously harmed. The longer term outlook is even more gloomy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Washington State, the failure of one of our biggest banks--Washington Mutual--last week has been a local reminder of the gravity of this crisis, as was the Wachovia failure a few days later. Thousands of financial industry employees, including Washington Mutual employees in the Puget Sound area, will likely lose their jobs in this collapse, which has largely resulted from bad decisions made by executives that most Americans consider to be grossly overpaid. It's understandable for Americans  to be angry and to oppose any direct bailout of Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a lot of the people who are being hurt by this crisis today are not overpaid bankers or stock market executives. They are working class families in our towns whose small businesses can't get credit for inventory or payroll and people down the street who are not able to obtain a car loan to replace a broken down automobile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economists remind us that auto sales are typically one of the first indicators of economic trouble. Last month, car sales dropped by 27 percent from September 2007, the slowest pace of auto purchases since 1991. The chief economist at J.D. Power and Associates, Bob Schnorbus, estimates that the credit crunch alone is responsible for more than 40,000 people being denied loans every month. And as the crisis has deepened in recent weeks, even people with good jobs and credit are having difficulty  arranging auto financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The financial disruption is also affecting student loans--the primary way through which we as a nation open the doors of higher education to middle and lower class Americans. The buyout of Wachovia has limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges to $9.3 billion the bank has held for them in a short-term investment fund. Many of these schools are struggling to meet their payrolls and other commitments, including scholarships, as we start another school year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the longer term, if credit contracts further, so will the availability and affordability of student loans. If it closes the doors of higher education to American kids, this short-term financial crisis has the potential to result in a long-term loss of competitiveness in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small businesses are also feeling the burden. As my colleagues know, small businesses account for roughly half of the nation's total economic output and employ about 40 percent of the total U.S. workforce. The chief economist for the Small Business Administration noted in an interview this week that these businesses are either being denied capital to grow and add jobs or they are simply afraid to seek capital because they are scared of the direction of the economy. More than anything else, cutting  off capital to small businesses will be an enormous drag on the economy and job creation over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit squeeze is already having a downstream impact on our economy. Consumer spending this quarter appears to be declining for the first time in 17 years. Last month, unemployment reached a 5-year high--6.1 percent--and new filings for unemployment hit the highest level since just after the September 11th attacks. Factory orders are down, and manufacturing activity has fallen to the lowest level in seven years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two major employers in the rural areas in my district--Port Townsend Paper and Grays Harbor Paper--are victims of this loss of confidence. These firms, both critical to employment in their respective cities, have stated that they are already taking steps to protect themselves from a recession, holding off on investments and new hires as they prepare for a decline in sales.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with mounting evidence that the impact of this crisis is being felt well beyond Wall Street, I am supporting this bill. I am not doing so in order to boost the salaries of Wall Street executives, but so that janitors and nurses and secretaries and teachers and car dealers in my district can keep their jobs. I am supporting this bill so that kids and their parents will still have the access to affordable loans to go to college--an advantage I had as a young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not suggesting this is a perfect solution. But like Warren Buffet, I would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. And I am absolutely convinced that we must take action very soon before the credit crisis deepens and before it affects the lives and livelihoods of even more of our friends and neighbors. The time to act is now. This is the only option before us. We must pass it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my constituents didn't cause this economic mess, but if our action to this crisis is inaction, they would disproportionally bear the brunt of this financial meltdown. The credit market would severely tighten, preventing consumers with excellent credit scores from purchasing a new automobile, sending a son or daughter to college, or refinancing their mortgage to avoid foreclosure. Pension funds would erode, putting senior citizens from our community in an impossible  financial situation. Layoffs would be felt throughout south Florida, and inflation would erode buyers' purchasing power. The Department of Labor reported today that the American economy lost 159,000 jobs in September, bringing the total number of jobs lost in 2008 to 760,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Wall Street banker will never bear the brunt of this economic downturn like a small business owner, high school teacher, or law enforcement officer struggling to get by in this economy. To stabilize our economy and insulate Main Street from Wall Street, we must reinvest in the troubled markets, reimburse the taxpayer by requiring the plan to be repaid in full, and reform how business is done on Wall Street by enacting strict oversight measures and limiting excessive compensation for CEOs and  executives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida is ground zero for the housing foreclosure crisis, and this legislation provides property tax relief for up to 30 million homeowners nationwide and allows the Government to now work more directly with loan service providers to make problem loans more affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have significant reservations about this financial recovery legislation, as do many of my Democratic and Republican colleagues. This is a vote that I did not cast lightly, but knowing that families, retirees and small business owners were suffering along Main Street, I was left with no option but to support the package.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400404" topic="STUDENT LOANS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, deciding how to vote on this issue has been among the most difficult votes I have cast in Congress. The economic condition and well-being of every American will be affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to be uncomfortable with the degree of government intrusion into our economy that this bill would authorize. I also continue to be concerned about the economic consequences to all Americans if some sort of action is not taken. It is balancing those two positions that make this vote an extremely difficult one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is better now than it was earlier. The increase in the amount of deposits that can be insured by the FDIC will help bring significantly more capital into all banks--those that are troubled and those who have not made the risky loans that precipitated this crisis. The SEC announcement "clarifying" the mark-to-market accounting rules could help unleash billions of dollars that were sidelined. Both of these changes will help bring more private capital into the system so that the entire  burden of stabilizing troubled institutions does not fall on the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the asset purchase program is managed competently, the cost to the taxpayers should be far less than the $700 billion authorized, as both the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, have said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other major consideration for me is that if this bill does not pass, a far worse bill probably will. I would like to write this bill differently and to have other options considered. I have little doubt, however, that if this improved bill does not pass today, the next bill will veer to the left in an attempt to attract more Democratic votes and will result in more government intrusion and a higher cost to the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I weigh my concerns about the level of government intervention with my concerns for the economic consequences of inaction or of a far worse bill, I have decided that it is in the best interests of the Nation for this bill to pass so that hopefully the economic recovery can begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a crisis of confidence in our credit system, and there is a real danger that if it spreads, Americans all across the country will not be able to get car loans, home mortgages, or loans to operate their businesses. There is even a danger that some may not be able to withdraw their money from various retirement accounts. The result could be a severe recession, greater unemployment, and consequences that all Americans will feel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is likely that the United States will face more economic problems in the days ahead even with this bill. We will never know what bigger problems might be averted. But, in my view, the potential consequences of not acting outweigh the deep reservations I have about this proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that any measure will be somewhat unfair in that those who took the excessive risks and made unwise decisions will be protected from the full consequences of their decisions. Unfortunately, some degree of unfairness is inevitable, but calculations of fairness must also consider what is best for the whole country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, a tax bill was added to this measure. It would have been better to have kept the two bills separate. I strongly support extending current tax law so that Americans will not face a tax increase, which would be a huge blow to economic growth. However, I am not pleased with the numerous special interest tax provisions that are included and are exactly the kind of thing that understandably frustrates the American people about their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A former minister in my home church used to say that "Sometimes you have to put aside  your principles and do what's right." I believe at this extraordinary time passing this flawed bill is the right thing to do.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and believe this bill must be enacted as soon as possible to stop our country from falling deeper into recession. Today, Madam Speaker, we were informed that our economy lost jobs for the ninth month in a row. This brings the total jobs lost this year to 760,000. But, Madam Speaker, jobs are not the only thing Americans across this Nation are losing; they are losing their hold on the  American Dream. That dream, Madam Speaker, is upward economic mobility and home ownership. Nowhere is this problem more acute than in minority communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this bill is about more than Wall Street; it is about Broad Street and Walker Street. It is about grocery stores, beauty salons, barber shops, community banks, and automobile dealerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, minority communities are hemorrhaging jobs, homes, income, and most importantly, credit. Consider this fact, African Americans received 35 percent of the subprime purchase loans issued from 2004-2007; of these loans 62 percent of them will reset to a higher rate by the end of 2008. Many of these homes' values have dropped by 25 percent, access to refinancing credit is no longer available, and their pension plans have lost substantial value. These dynamics are debilitating to minority  businesses and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These powerful and destructive economic forces coupled with a lost of liquidity on Wall Street have led to the greatest reduction of wealth in the minority community since the Great Depression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am here today. I believe this bill must pass. We must ensure that the minority communities do not just survive but thrive.</paragraph>

But the risk of taking no action is too great and too dangerous for our economy, and the financial stability of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must pass this legislation, even with its imperfections, to unlock the credit market that is essential to both individuals and businesses. Without a properly functioning credit market, small businesses, the backbone of Missouri's economy, risk not making payroll. Americans will have increasing difficulty obtaining car loans, home loans, farm loans, student loans, as well as other forms of credit upon which we all rely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard from many Missourians concerned about the effect of tightened money-lending standards. From the hardworking couple just about to retire who have watched the value of the retirement savings dramatically decline over the past month to the family who needs to buy a new car but cannot qualify for a loan because of the freeze in the credit market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economic downturn is also hitting our small businesses. In my hometown of St. Louis, Feld Chevrolet, a St. Louis leader for over 27 years, has shut its doors because the lender stopped financing the dealership's inventory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stories like these make it clear we have a responsibility to act before the credit crisis further undermines our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without decisive action, most economists have noted that the situation will only worsen, credit markets will freeze, Main Street will suffer, and Missouri families will struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents as well as yours will not be able to make basic home and car loans. Small businesses will not be able to make their payrolls, and credit card interest rates will soar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today is a vast improvement over the original proposal put forward by the Bush administration, which gave unprecedented and unchecked authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to spend $700 billion. We have made it clear that Congress does not write blank checks to Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will require the Government to develop an emergency line of credit to reduce foreclosures as it buys troubled financial assets, allows the Government to purchase other types of mortgages to unfreeze the credit market, and allows the Government to purchase certain troubled assets form pension plans to ensure individual retirement security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan proposal will help insulate the American people and Main Street from the crisis on Wall Street as we stabilize the markets. It will also, protect taxpayers by ensuring public investments reap any profits and the financial industry is responsible for any short fall and it ends excess compensation for executives of participating financial institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following, the House vote last Monday, the stock market plunged an historic 777 points, costing the American economy $1.2 trillion. Americans across the country saw their 401Ks, pension plans and savings account lose value. This was a loud wake up call that we must take swift and decisive action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are considering today is no longer focused on just a bailout of Wall Street; more importantly it is a buy-in so that we can turn our entire economy around and help hard working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In no way are we out of the woods. Times are and will continue to be difficult, but I believe passage of this bill can help us get back on track and help prevent our economy from spiraling out of control. These times will certainly demand additional steps and common sense leadership to get America back on her feet again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
