    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the John T. Vucurevich Foundation for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects their hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role they have played in giving back to their local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The John T. Vucurevich Foundation works with the Black Hills Area Habitat for Humanity. With the impressive financial support the John T. Vucurevich Foundation has shown, the Black Hills Area Habitat affiliate has been able to obtain a ReStore Outlet. The John T. Vucurevich Foundation has shown its continued support by providing construction materials and furthering the goals of the Black Hills Area affiliate in many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize the John T. Vucurevich Foundation and to congratulate them on receiving this well-earned award and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
