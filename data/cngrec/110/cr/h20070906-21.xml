  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, No Child Left Behind originally sought to return some education policy-making authority to the States, but in its current form the legislation is a massive spending bill filled with Federal mandates that increases the presence of Federal bureaucrats in our classrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Michigan teachers are forced to adopt a "teach to the test" mentality and spend valuable time on paperwork instead of students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been estimated that teachers and school officials have spent an additional 6.7 million hours completing the cumbersome paperwork required by No Child Left Behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congress considers the future of education policy in America, we must find a way to give our schools, communities and parents greater flexibility, reduce the bureaucracy in education and ensure the best educational opportunities are being given to our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I believe each child's educational path should be determined by a child's parents and not by the Federal Government, I am an original cosponsor of the A-PLUS Act, an alternative education policy introduced this year in the House. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
