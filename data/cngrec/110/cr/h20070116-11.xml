    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Saturday, January 7, South Carolina's adjutant general, Stan Spears, hosted the departure ceremony for the 218th Enhanced Separate Infantry Brigade. The event was attended by 10,000 appreciative family members and supporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 218th Brigade is commanded by Brigadier General Robert Livingston. General Livingston and his wife Barbara's daughters, Rachel, Rebecca and Roxanne, led the national anthem at the ceremony. The brigade consists of 1,800 soldiers and will be in Afghanistan for approximately 1 year. Its primary mission will be to train Afghan national army and national police. This is the largest single deployment of South Carolina Army National Guard since World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a grateful 25-year veteran of the 218th and father of four sons in the military, I have the deepest respect and admiration for the men and women who put their lives at risk to protect American families. My thoughts and prayers are with them and their families. Our office is available at all times for servicemembers and families toll free at 1-888-381-1442.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
