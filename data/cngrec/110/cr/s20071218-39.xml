  <narrative>RENEWABLE CONSUMER AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACT -- (Senate - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15895">S15895</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I am pleased that the Congress is sending energy legislation to the President. For too long, the United States has taken a back seat in the fight against global warming. This bill is a good first step in moving our Nation's energy policy in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the support of a number of Senators, this legislation, and title I in particular, would not have been possible. I wish to extend particular thanks to Senators FEINSTEIN, STEVENS, LEVIN, SNOWE, KERRY, DORGAN, LOTT, CARPER, BOXER, DURBIN, ALEXANDER, CORKER, and CANTWELL for their work in increasing automobile fuel economy standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the tireless efforts of groups dedicated to conservation and improving national security were vital to enacting this legislation. Of special note is the support of a nonpartisan group of business executives and retired senior military leaders concerned about global energy security, known as Securing America's Future Energy, SAFE. I am grateful for the support and hard work of its leaders, Frederick W. Smith and General P.X. Kelley, as well as Robbie Diamond, who served as their liaison.  The Union of Concerned Scientists--David Friedman in particular--provided significant technical support and advocacy for the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House says that the President will sign the bill tomorrow. I thank him for taking swift action on this landmark legislation.</paragraph>
