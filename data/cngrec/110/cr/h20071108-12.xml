  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, illegal logging is a scourge of poor countries and rich countries alike. It damages the environment, often very fragile ecosystems, it disrupts the lives of poor, indigenous people. It corrodes their governments through bribery and often violence. Illegal logging also hurts rich countries as our timber and lumber manufacturing industries lose to those who cheat and bribe, over a billion dollars a year in lost sales in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do something about it. Yesterday, the Natural Resources Committee passed out my illegal logging bill to give the tools for the first time, to our government, to do something about it. Later this morning, we can pass the Peru Free Trade Agreement, with not just the strongest environmental protections ever in a trade agreement, but with specific provisions to halt the illegal mahogany harvest in Peru's forests. This can be the most significant Congress ever in the global fight to end illegal  logging by passing these bipartisan measures.</paragraph>
