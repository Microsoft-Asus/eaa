  <narrative>MEDICAL IMAGING SERVICES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10738]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today and ask my colleagues to support legislation reversing the dangerous cuts made to medical imaging services by the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The incorporation of imaging technology into medical practice has transformed physician practice, patient care, and improved health outcomes for millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Deficit Reduction Act last Congress slashed funding for imaging services. These dangerous cuts mean that women will have difficulty getting a mammogram. Doctors will begin to phase out imaging services because the reimbursement rate will cause them to lose money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these cuts may have saved the government money, it has increased the health risks of our Nation's citizens. Patients throughout the United States depend on medical imaging because it often detects critical illnesses at their most curable stage when they are less costly to treat. Better, less invasive care often means easier recoveries and greater patient comfort are additional reasons why drastic cuts to medical imaging do not serve the patient well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medical imaging is an overall cost-saver for patients and the health care system in general because it results in fewer complications, earlier detection, shorter hospital stays, and better pain management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our goal should be keeping our workers healthy and on the job by helping them avoid surgery, long recuperation and disability. For this reason, significant cuts to medical imaging are not the solution. That is why I ask your support and need it for <bill type="h" number="1293">H.R. 1293</bill>, Access to Medical Care Imaging Act of 2007. My legislation would suspend for 2 years drastic cuts to critical diagnostic imaging services provided in physicians' offices and imaging centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cuts were agreed to with little public debate by the U.S. House of Representatives, yet they account for more than one-third of the Medicare cuts in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Furthermore, as was directly pointed out by Members on both sides of the aisle during the Energy and Health Subcommittee hearing on July 18 last year, the policy was not recommended to Congress by MedPAC or CMS, and there has been no analysis of the impact of the cuts on seniors' access to imaging services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, despite broad bipartisan support in Congress to delay the DRA policy, the DRA imaging cuts went into effect in January of this year. My legislation would place a 2-year hold on the implementation of the cuts and require a comprehensive GAO study on patient access and service issues relating to the availability and quality of imaging services in physician offices and imaging clinics with special attention to seniors living in rural and medically underserved areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join over 150 of my colleagues and become a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="1293">H.R. 1293</bill>. People have to understand sometimes the cuts that we make around here are not in the best interest certainly of our constituents. Spending most of my life as a nurse, preventive care is better than letting it go. That is why our health care costs are so high. We need to do a better job of making sure that our constituents are served.</paragraph>
