  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the failure of Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act amounts to a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties and 4,400 school districts across our country. For Wasco County, Oregon, this means cutting core school programs, removing the one detective from the drug enforcement task force, and losing 40 percent of the road department employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In their own words, Sheriff Rick Eisland says, "Losing these funds will leave a huge void in our fight against illegal drug activity and we would also be forced to cut our contract with the Forest Service to patrol in the Federal lands."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>School Superintendent Candy Armstrong says, "Rural schools have nowhere else to cut except core services. Lost funding represents the entire high school math program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Judge Dan Ericksen says, "Roads are the lifeblood of rural America, and losing this funding is the equivalent of applying tourniquets to our arms and legs. We will no longer be able to function."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Congress must keep the Federal Government's word to timber communities and pass <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>. Time is running out.</paragraph>
