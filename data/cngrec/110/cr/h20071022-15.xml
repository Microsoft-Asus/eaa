    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the issue we hear of regularly is national security, from Tehran to Turkey, back to the local community: How does it impact me? That is what our constituents are asking. They are concerned about security from the national and the local level. I think many of them are frustrated that those of us in Congress haven't done anything to address the criminal illegal alien situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to let the body know last week the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County, Virginia, took a stand by unanimously approving a tough local crackdown on illegal immigrants. They are doing it to make their community a safer place. It denies some county services to illegal immigrants and adds to enforcement powers already available to cops on the beat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do the same thing at the Federal level with the bipartisan CLEAR Act, which I introduced last month. It would get dangerous criminal aliens off the streets and require the Department of Homeland Security to pick them up within 48 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is <bill type="h" number="3494">H.R. 3494</bill>, the CLEAR Act. I would encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and do what the Prince William supervisors have done: put citizen safety first.</paragraph>
