  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every day the Bush White House is losing more credibility with the American people and with the Congress. Late last year the Justice Department fired eight U.S. Attorneys for purely political reasons. Last week, Attorney General Gonzales came to Capitol Hill and swore that the terminations had nothing to do with politics. But then 2 days ago we learned that these decisions were not made exclusively by the Justice Department. The political purge reached the highest levels  at the White House and was actually prompted by President Bush. So much for no political involvement from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this information would have never come out if the new Democratic Congress did not take its oversight responsibility seriously. U.S. Attorneys should be free of political pressure and that is simply not the case with the Bush White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will continue to demand answers from an administration that is not too interested in working with Congress. It would be nice if they would finally learn their lesson and realize that it is time to level with both the Congress and the American people.</paragraph>
