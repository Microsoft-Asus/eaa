    <paragraph>Mr. President, I made a mistake in my statement a few minutes ago. I have known Vicki Kennedy for many years. My staff tells me I mispronounced her name. That was certainly not intentional. I know Vicki. She was so kind and thoughtful to call me very early Saturday morning to let me know Ted was going into the hospital and I asked her to please call me when the surgery was finished, and Vicki did that. I called her Jackie for reasons unknown to anyone other than whoever puts words in  my mouth. I want the Record to be corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
