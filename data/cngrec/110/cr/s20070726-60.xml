  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="Introducing S. 1881. A bill to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to restore the intent and protections of that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1881">S. 1881</bill>] Mr. President, I am joining, today, with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, in introducing the ADA Restoration Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, July 26, marks the 17th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, one of the landmark civil rights laws of the 20th century, and a long-overdue emancipation proclamation for the 50 million Americans with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chief sponsor of the ADA in the Senate, I take pride in the progress we have made as a Nation since 1990. We have removed most physical barriers to movement and access for the 50 million Americans with disabilities. We have required employers to provide reasonable accommodations so that people with disabilities can have equal opportunity in the workplace. We have advanced the 4 goals of the ADA, equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today is a day, first and foremost, to celebrate all that has been accomplished over the last 17 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But despite that progress, there is a problem. In recent years, the courts have ignored Congress's clear intent as to who should be protected under the ADA. And the courts have narrowed the definition of who qualifies as an "individual with a disability." As a consequence, millions of people we intended to be protected under the ADA, including people with epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer, are not protected any more. In a ruling just this spring, the 11th Circuit court even concluded that a person  with mental retardation was not "disabled" under the ADA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back through the legislative history, it is abundantly clear that Congress intended that the protections in the ADA apply to all persons without regard to mitigating circumstances, such as taking medication or using an assistive device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee report Congress said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Education and Labor Committee report says the same thing, and goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, a person who is hard of hearing is substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a hearing aid. Likewise, persons with impairments, such as epilepsy or diabetes, which substantially limit a major life activity are covered under ..... the definition of disability, even if the effects of the impairment are controlled by medication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, in a series of cases, the Supreme Court ignored Congressional intent. Together, these Supreme Court cases have created an absurd and unintended Catch 22. People with serious health conditions like epilepsy or diabetes who are fortunate to find treatments that make them more capable and independent, and more able to work, may find that they are no longer protected by the ADA. If these individuals are no longer covered under the ADA, then their requests for a reasonable accommodation  at work can be denied, or they can be fired. On the other hand, if they stop taking their medication, they will be considered a person with a disability under the ADA, but they will be unable to do their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not just absurd, it is wrong. It flies in the face of clear, unambiguous Congressional intent. When we passed the law, there was common agreement on both sides of the aisle, and on the part of the White House, that the law was designed to protect any individual who is treated less favorably because of a current, past, or perceived disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This situation cries out for a modest, reasonable legislative fix, and that is exactly what we are doing, today, by introducing the ADA Restoration Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill amends the definition of "disability" so that people who Congress originally intended to be protected from discrimination are covered under the ADA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Presdient, 17 years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Likewise, today, we are building a strong bicameral, bipartisan majority to support ADA Restoration. A companion bill is being introduced, today, in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with the original passage of the ADA in 1990, it is going to take time to hold hearings and build strong majorities. But I look forward to working to restore Congress' original intent, and, once again, to ensure that Americans with disabilities are protected from discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="s" number="1881">S. 1881</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Congress intended that the Act "establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability", and provide broad coverage and vigorous and effective remedies without unnecessary and obstructive defenses;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) decisions and opinions of the Supreme Court have unduly narrowed the broad scope of protection afforded by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, eliminating protection for a broad range of individuals whom Congress intended to protect;</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Congress recognized that physical and mental impairments are natural parts of the human experience that in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, but Congress also recognized that people with physical or mental impairments having the talent, skills, abilities, and desire to participate in society are frequently precluded from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated attitudes, or the failure  to remove societal and institutional barriers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4)(A) Congress modeled the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 definition of disability on that of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (referred to in this section as "section 504"), which had, prior to the date of enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, been construed broadly to encompass both actual and perceived limitations, and limitations imposed by society; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the broad conception of the definition contained in section 504 had been underscored by the Supreme Court's statement in its decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987), that the definition "acknowledged that society's myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) in adopting, in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the concept of disability expressed in section 504, Congress understood that adverse action based on a person's physical or mental impairment is often unrelated to the limitations caused by the impairment itself;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) instead of following congressional expectations that the term "disability" would be interpreted broadly in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Supreme Court has ruled, in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the elements of the definition "need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled" and, consistent with that view, has narrowed the application of the definition in various ways; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) contrary to explicit congressional intent expressed in the committee reports for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Supreme Court has eliminated from the Act's coverage individuals who have mitigated the effects of their impairments through the use of such measures as medication and assistive devices.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to effect the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990's objectives of providing "a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination" and "clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination" by restoring the broad scope of protection available under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to respond to certain decisions of the Supreme Court, including Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., (527 U.S. 471 (1999), Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 527 U.S. 516 (1999), Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555 (1999), and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that have narrowed the class of people who can invoke the protection from discrimination that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 provides; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to reinstate the original congressional intent regarding the definition of disability in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying that the protection of that Act is available for all individuals who are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) subjected to adverse treatment based on an actual or perceived impairment, or a record of impairment; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) adversely affected--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) by prejudiced attitudes, such as myths, fears, ignorance, or stereotypes concerning disability or particular disabilities; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) by the failure to remove societal and institutional barriers, including communication, transportation, and architectural barriers, or the failure to provide reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures, reasonable accommodations, and auxiliary aids and services.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101(a)) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(1)(A) physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of the human experience that in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B)(i) people with physical or mental disabilities having the talent, skills, abilities, and desire to participate in society are frequently precluded from doing so because of discrimination; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) other people who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability have also been subjected to discrimination;"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) by striking paragraph (7) and inserting the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(7)(A) individuals with disabilities have been subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, have had restrictions and limitations imposed upon them because of their disabilities, and have been relegated to positions of political powerlessness in society; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) classifications and selection criteria that exclude individuals with disabilities should be strongly disfavored, subjected to skeptical and meticulous examination, and permitted only for highly compelling reasons, and never on the basis of prejudice, myths, irrational fears, ignorance, or stereotypes about disability;".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(2) DISABILITY.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) IN GENERAL.--The term `disability' means--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) a physical or mental impairment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) a record of a physical or mental impairment; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iii) being regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) DETERMINATION OF IMPAIRMENT.--The determination of whether an individual has a physical or mental impairment shall be made without regard to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(I) whether the individual uses a mitigating measure;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(II) the impact of any mitigating measures the individual may or may not be using;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(III) whether any manifestation of the impairment is episodic; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(IV) whether the impairment is in remission or latent.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) MITIGATING MEASURES.--The term `mitigating measure' means any treatment, medication, device, or other measure used to eliminate, mitigate, or compensate for the effect of an impairment, and includes prescription and other medications, personal aids and devices (including assistive technology devices and services), reasonable accommodations, and auxiliary aids and services."; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (7) and inserting after paragraph (2) the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(3) MENTAL IMPAIRMENT.--The term `mental', used with respect to an impairment, means any mental or psychological disorder such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, or specific learning disability.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(4) PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT.--The term `physical', used with respect to an impairment, means any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting 1 or more of the following body systems:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) Neurological.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) Musculoskeletal.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) Special sense organs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) Respiratory, including speech organs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) Cardiovascular.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(F) Reproductive.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(G) Digestive.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(H) Genitourinary.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(I) Hemic and lymphatic.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(J) Skin.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(K) Endocrine.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(5) RECORD OF A PHYSICAL OR MENTAL IMPAIRMENT.--The term `record of a physical or mental impairment' means a history of, or a  misclassification as having, a physical or mental impairment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(6) REGARDED AS HAVING A PHYSICAL OR MENTAL IMPAIRMENT.--The term `regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' means perceived or treated as having a physical or mental impairment, whether or not the individual involved has an impairment.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 5.

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 1882. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish various programs for the recruitment and retention of public health workers and to eliminate critical public health workforce shortages in Federal, State, local, and tribal public health agencies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1882">S. 1882</bill>] Mr. President, in the last few years, our Nation's public health has been threatened repeatedly. We have faced natural disasters like the horrific damage done by Hurricane Katrina. We have endured human-led catastrophes like the tragic September 11 attacks. Only a couple of months ago, a man infected with a potentially lethal strain of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis was able to travel from his home in Atlanta to France, Greece, the Czech Republic, and Canada, before ending  up at a center in Denver for treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These emergencies have made it clear that our public health system must be prepared for the unexpected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from incidents like these depends upon an adequately staffed and well trained public health workforce. But if we look at our public health workforce today, what we see is alarming: an aging staff nearing retirement with no clear pipeline of trained employees to fill the void.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average age of lab technicians, epidemiologists, environmental health experts, microbiologists, IT specialists, administrators, and other public health workers is 47. That is 7 years older than the average age of the Nation's workforce. Retirement rates are as high as 20 percent in some State public health agencies. Nearly half of the Federal employees in positions critical to our biodefense will be eligible to retire by 2012. The average age of a public health nurse is near 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These statistics are sobering. As the responsibilities of our public health workforce are growing, their ranks continue to shrink. These are shortages that impact not just for the security of our health, but our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't afford to overlook this problem any longer. For the third consecutive Congress, Senator Hagel and I are introducing the Public Health Preparedness Workforce Development Act of 2007. This is a bill that will increase the pipeline of qualified public health workers at all levels--Federal, State, local, and tribal. It offers scholarships and loan repayment as recruitment and retention incentives for students who enter and stay in the field of public health. It also provides opportunities  for mid-career public health professionals to go back for additional training in public health preparedness or biodefense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time to prepare for a public health emergency, whether that be a natural disaster or one of our own making, is not tomorrow, nor next month, nor a year from now, but today. Looking forward we must strengthen our public health workforce. I urge my colleagues to join me and the Senator from Nebraska in taking up and passing the Public Health Preparedness Workforce Development Act. We must all make a commitment to securing the safety of our nation, and that security begins with our public health.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 1883. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for standardized marketing requirements under the Medicare Advantage program and the Medicare prescription drug program and to provide for State certification prior to waiver of licensure requirements under the Medicare prescription drug program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1883">S. 1883</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Accountability and Transparency in Medicare Marketing Act, on behalf of myself and Senator DORGAN and WYDEN. This legislation aims to regulate the marketing standards and sales tactics of Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug plans, now the fastest growing segment of Medicare and a prime target for fraud, misrepresentation, and deceptive sales practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I recently held a hearing entitled, "Medicare Advantage Marketing and Sales: Who Has the Advantage?" Our hearing uncovered that a large majority of State insurance departments have received, and continue to receive, an unprecedented number of complaints about inappropriate or confusing marketing practices that have led Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans without adequately understanding the consequences of their decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation will facilitate the creation of uniform marketing standards that will be adopted and enforced by individual states. Based on current law, CMS has exclusive authority to investigate and discipline the marketing and selling of Medicare advantage products, while States have only been permitted to examine and enforce violations against individual insurance agents. This unusual arrangement, which some might call a pre-emption of authority, has left a sizable enforcement gap that has  exacerbated the problems found by the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will close that gap, giving States the ability to standardize marketing and sales regulations, as well as regulate both agents and companies in the marketing and sales of  Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans. Ultimately, State insurance commissioners will have the ability to work in conjunction with CMS in order to provide the most comprehensive protection possible for Medicare beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senior citizens deserve to have access to the health care plan that best serves their needs without having to worry about being purposely mislead and deceived. I believe we must repair this disconnect in oversight and ensure the protection of American seniors, and I hope my colleagues will join in my effort to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="Introducing S. 1884. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to reauthorize and improve agricultural energy programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry,">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1884">S. 1884</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will help deliver clean energy technologies from the research pipelines of our labs into the hands of our farmers and ranchers, so that we can take better advantage of our farms and fields for clean energy production. This bill, called the Harvesting Energy Act, will bolster the energy title of this year's farm bill, building on the good ideas that Chairman HARKIN, Ranking Member CHAMBLISS, and the rest of us on the  Agriculture Committee have been working on for several months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the Harvesting Energy Act reflects the broad-based, bipartisan input of the 25 by '25 coalition which, earlier this year, provided us with their policy recommendations for how we can produce 25 percent of our energy from renewable resources by 2025. The 25 by '25 vision has been endorsed by 22 current and former Governors and several State legislatures across the country, along with over 500 organizations and companies, including the Big Three automobile manufacturers, agricultural  producers, and environmental groups. We established 25 by '25 as a national goal earlier this year when we passed the Energy bill in the Senate. We must now implement the policies that are necessary to achieve that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken many times about the urgency of moving this Nation toward energy independence by making better use of the resources we have here at home. Responsible development of our oil and gas resources, improved efficiency and conservation, and more aggressive investment in renewable energy technologies--these are the three pillars upon which we must build an economy that is less dependent on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not need to remind my colleagues of the dangers that oil dependence poses to the United States and to global security. It is oil that empowers states such as lran, Venezuela, and Syria. It is oil that contributes to violence in Iraq, Nigeria, and the Sudan. It is oil that places Russia and China in a dangerous competition for oil in Central Asia and Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress has made remarkable progress since January in confronting the daunting task of reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It is an effort that has spanned several committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy bill that we passed in early June represented the diligent work of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Finance Committee. I was proud of the work we did on that bill, from creating meaningful oil savings targets to making smarter investments in renewables, improving vehicle standards, and establishing a national goal of producing 25 percent of our energy from our farms and fields by 2025.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also proud of the energy work we are doing on the farm bill in the Agriculture Committee. Thanks to Chairman Harkin's leadership, the 2007 farm bill will build on the 2002 farm bill's first-ever energy title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important step that recognizes the central role that our farmers and ranchers must play in a new, clean energy economy. We have the most productive lands and most efficient farmers in the world, allowing America to be the breadbasket for the global community. With these resources, talent, and ingenuity, there is no doubt that we can grow our way to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I travel through Colorado, the possibilities of a clean energy revolution, driven by farmers and ranchers, are clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Weld County, Logan County, and Yuma County, we are seeing biofuel plants spring to life, creating new markets and new opportunities for our rural communities. In 2004, there were no ethanol plants in Colorado. Today, three plants produce more than 90 million gallons per year, and a fourth plant will come on line later this year, adding another 50 million gallons per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is not just biofuels. In the San Luis Valley, where my family has lived for five generations, Xcel Energy just broke ground on the largest solar plant in North America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have added 60 megawatts of wind capacity in Colorado in the last 2 years, and by the end of 2007, we will add another 775 megawatts, more than tripling the State's production of wind power to more than 1,000 megawatts. This is good for households along the Front Range that get clean, affordable power, and it is good for the ranchers in Prowers County, who own the land on which the turbines sit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These biofuel plants, wind turbines, and solar farms are revitalizing rural communities that have been withering on the vine. They are bringing life back to main streets that were boarded up and excitement back to farmers and ranchers who are eager to be a part of our clean energy revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I am introducing today will help stimulate this revolution by getting more renewable energy technologies out of the development pipeline and into the fields, where they belong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is based on the recommendations contained in the 25 by 25 Action Plan and builds on those ideas with important new initiatives to supplement the energy title of the farm bill. Our goal is to ensure that the renewable energy work being done at the Department of Energy and in colleges and universities throughout the country, in which we invested earlier this year through the Energy bill, is accompanied by a strong commitment at USDA to bring the resulting technologies and methods out to farmers  and ranchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USDA has a long history of identifying promising new production methods and technologies, refining them, and making them available to agricultural producers. The Akron Research Station in Washington County, CO, is a great example. For 100 years it has connected our farmers in eastern Colorado with the latest practical agricultural research available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USDA can and should be making the same efforts to disperse the latest and best developments from the renewable energy revolution to farmers and ranchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to briefly describe four ways in which my bill will bolster USDA's capabilities in this area and help make the 25x'25 vision a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Harvesting Energy Act of expands and extends Section 9006 of the farm bill, which offers competitive grants and loan guarantees to help farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses invest in proven clean energy technologies. My bill adds $280 million to section 9006, following the recommendations of the 25x'25 Agriculture Energy Alliance. This will ramp up the loan guarantees for cellulosic ethanol facilities, encourage community wind and other electric power projects, and expand  the number of eligible applicants for these loans and grants. This is a responsible way to help more farmers become net energy producers of on-farm renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, my bill accelerates research, development, demonstration, and deployment of renewable resources such as biomass, wind, solar, and renewable natural gas. I am proposing that we devote an additional $200 million per year to these efforts, with the specific goals of bringing biomass energy feedstocks such as native grasses and short-rotation trees into production; perfecting our biorefinery and conversion technologies; refining biofuels from these biomass feedstocks; and making use of the  biobased coproducts to add value to the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, if we are to continue to expand biofuels production, we need to ensure that the supply is stable so that we don't encounter major shortages in droughts or in periods of adverse weather. Storing feedstocks like corn, oilseed crops, and biomass for cellulosic ethanol will better protect consumers from huge price fluctuations or shortages. My bill would create a voluntary biofuel feedstock reserve that would encourage farmers to store these feedstocks on-farm and make them available for biofuel  production when a price spike or a shortage occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the Harvesting Energy Act invests in research and development in new production technologies that promise to yield high energy returns and carbon storage. One of the key investments that this bill makes is in biochar. Biochar is a type of charcoal produced from biomass that is valuable as a soil amendment. The USDA and DOE are finding that they can produce biochar as a carbon-capturing byproduct of cellulosic ethanol production. This is good for farmers, who put the biochar back into  the soil as a fertilizer, good for the environment because it reduces carbon emissions, and good for consumers because it could drive down cellulosic ethanol production costs. My bill would provide $50 million in competitive funding for research and development grants to scale-up and commercialize biochar production systems. Like so much else we are doing in the energy title of the farm bill, this would move ideas from the research pipeline out into the field, where they need to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes a wide range of other provisions that build on the good work that the Agriculture Committee is doing on the farm bill. Like the provisions I have described, they aim to expand the menu of renewable energy options we have available as we work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their leadership on the Agriculture Committee and for their commitment to creating a robust energy title in this year's farm bill. I firmly believe that with the right investments and a commitment from this Congress, our farmers and ranchers can help lead us down the path to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Smith. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to Critical Medications Act ACMA, a bill that will vastly improve the coverage millions of vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries receive through the Medicare prescription drug program, known as Part D. The new drug benefit has been a tremendous success, providing access to affordable prescription drug therapies to millions of beneficiaries, some for the very first time. But many of our most vulnerable seniors, especially those suffering  from serious health conditions like mental illness, HIV/AIDS or cancer, often have difficulty obtaining the vital drug therapies they need to remain functional, or in some cases, to survive. To remedy these problems, the bill I am introducing today will give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, the regulatory tools it needs to ensure that all prescription drug plans, PDP, provide unfettered access to medically essential drug therapies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My connection to this issue began long before Medicare's new prescription drug benefit went into effect. As chairman of the Aging Committee, I held a hearing in the spring of 2005 to explore how well CMS was preparing to transition dual-eligible beneficiaries, those who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, into Medicare Part D. At that hearing, advocates expressed a number of concerns with the implementation of the new drug benefit, and chief among them was guaranteeing that vulnerable beneficiaries  had access to important drug therapies that either stabilized or improved their health condition. I made a personal request to then CMS Administrator Dr. Mark McClellan to work with prescription drug plans to ensure that their formularies provide access to all available drugs in certain pharmaceutical classes, including those that contain</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I was pleased with CMS providing this additional protection for the vital drug therapies in the six protected classes, its actual impact on beneficiaries gaining access to the medications they need has been uneven at best. For one, the policy was issued as sub-regulatory guidance, which limits CMS' ability to enforce it. While it is true that the annual contracts CMS develops with prescription drug plans generally include a requirement that they abide by the "all or substantially all"  guidance, the agency's record of enforcing the policy has been quite poor. Instead of plans covering all drugs in the six protected classes, as CMS claims plan contracts require, beneficiaries, often the most frail and vulnerable, have had extensive access problems because their PDPs do not include their medication on its formulary. In fact, data from a study being conducted by the American Psychiatric</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should note that beneficiaries often are able to access a drug that should be covered on their plan's formulary by filing a coverage appeal. However, that process is usually long and difficult to complete, and results in the problem only being solved for one beneficiary. I appreciate the responsiveness of drug plans to specific beneficiaries' difficulties with accessing the drugs they need, but if they are not addressing the concerns raised through the appeals process on a broader scale, problems  will only continue to occur. I believe we need a system-wide approach to ensuring that beneficiaries have access to the life-saving and life-improving medications they need and I believe that solution lies within the legislation I am filing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Access to Critical Medications Act ACMA would codify, for a 5-year period, the current policies in CMS existing "all or substantially all" sub-regulatory guidance. I am hopeful that providing this statutory authority will signal to plans that it is no longer an option to cover all available drugs in the six protected classes. It is a legal requirement that must be adhered to in order to participate in Medicare Part D. Accordingly, I would expect that this change will empower CMS to take  a more proactive role in ensuring that prescription drug plan sponsors are not placing arbitrary barriers to accessing these critical medications covered by the "all or substantially all" policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 5 year period that the "all or substantially all" policy will be effective, the ACMA directs CMS to establish a process through regulation, that would allow for this important policy to be updated and enforced in future years. None of us hold the knowledge of the pharmaceutical and medical developments of tomorrow. In a decade, there could be major breakthroughs in treating any number of debilitating illnesses, which may require the creation of or modification of pharmaceutical classes  covered by this important policy. CMS needs to have the authority to update the classes and categories it covers and the process the ACMA creates will provide them the tools to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to use those tools, the ACMA defines specific, clinically-based criteria that the Secretary must follow when evaluating whether a drug class should be added or removed from coverage under the policy. This will ensure that there is consistency in the manner by which the policy is evaluated in future years, so that the Secretary is not arbitrarily determining which medications are important enough so that all plans must provide access to them. The ACMA also makes modest changes to the  appeals process, to ensure that plans and CMS resolve beneficiary complaints in a timely manner, and that access to medications is guaranteed while the appeals process runs its course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The existing "all or substantially all" policy was a step in the right direction at the time it was created. However, as we approach the third year of Medicare's prescription drug benefit, beneficiaries' actual experience in the program provides overwhelming support that we need a more robust approach to helping vulnerable beneficiaries get the medications they need.  As importantly, CMS must have a regulatory process in place that will enable it to  modify the classes covered by the policy in response to changes in medical and pharmaceutical science. I believe the ACMA clearly addresses both those needs, and I hope my colleagues will agree. It is a well thought out policy that strikes a careful balance between flexibility and enforceability. Advocacy groups such as the American Psychiatric Association, the National Alliance for</paragraph>

  <narrative>COALITION,</narrative>
  <narrative>July 20, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR SMITH: We are writing on behalf of the Access to Critical Medications Coalition to offer our strong support for your Medicare Access to Critical Medications Act. The Coalition represents a diverse group of national and community-based patient, provider and advocacy organizations dedicated to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries with HIV/AIDS, mental illnesses, epilepsy, cancer, organ failure, and autoimmune diseases have reliable access through Medicare Part D to the prescriptions  that they need to stay healthy.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Medicare Access to Critical Medications Act will strengthen protections for these medically vulnerable populations by codifying the requirement that Medicare Part D plans cover "all or substantially all" drugs in the six classes of drugs that are critical to treating HIV/AIDS, mental illnesses, cancer, epilepsy, autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's, and transplant patients. As you may know, coverage of nearly all of the drugs in these categories is standard practice among state Medicaid  programs and private insurers because it is more cost effective and better for people with these conditions when clinicians have the flexibility to prescribe the drug or drugs most appropriate to manage the condition according to factors unique to them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Passage of this bill is important because the current protections for these drug classes offered in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) guidance are not guaranteed beyond this year and are being ignored by drug plans with no risk of sanctions. Surveys of HIV and mental health medical providers indicate that Medicare beneficiaries with these conditions have been hospitalized or experienced dangerous treatment interruptions due to challenges with Medicare Part D coverage, including burdensome  prior authorization processes. Many of the beneficiaries reporting problems are very low-income and live on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) checks or modest disability payments. Paying out of pocket for drugs denied by Medicare Part D drug plans is not an option for most.</narrative>
  <narrative>On behalf of Medicare beneficiaries with these life-threatening illnesses, thank you for your leadership in working to ensure access to critical medications through Medicare Part D by requiring drug plans to cover "all or substantially all" of the drugs available to treat these serious, but treatable conditions.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <narrative>Arlington, VA, July 24, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR SMITH: I am writing on behalf of the American Psychiatric Association (AP A), the medical specialty representing more than 38,000 psychiatric physicians nationwide, to express our strong support for your Medicare Access to Critical Medications Act of 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill will provide crucial protections in the Medicare Part D program for six classes of life-saving medications. Part D drug plans will be required to place substantially all anticancer, HIV/AIDS, and immunosuppressant medications on their formularies, as well as drugs that are important to people with severe mental illnesses--antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. In addition, when a drug plan and a patient's physician disagree about whether a critical medication is needed,  your legislation will require that the medication be covered until the appeals process can be completed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Unfortunately, data from the first year of the Part D program point to the need for additional protections for patients with serious diseases. In 2006, an American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE) study tracked 1,193 dually-eligible Medicare/Medicaid psychiatric patients and found that 53.4 percent experienced at least one problem with medication access or continuity. Among these patients, 19.8 percent had a subsequent emergency room visit reported, and 11 percent had  a hospitalization.  Furthermore, the study found that the most common medication classes with coverage problems included atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants (West, Wilk, Muszynski et al, American Journal of Psychiatry, 164:5 May 2007).</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, Part D patients will receive better care, and the Medicare program as a whole will save money, if access to important medications can be improved. Your legislation will create new statutory protections that will address a number of the most serious barriers.</narrative>
  <narrative>We greatly appreciate your leadership--and the hard work of your staff Matthew Canedy and Catherine Finley--in addressing this serious problem.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Carolyn B. Robinowitz, M.D.,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="Introducing S. 1892. A bill to reauthorize the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2008, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1892">S. 1892</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coast Guard Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2008 along with Senators SNOWE, INOUYE, STEVENS, LAUTENBERG, and LOTT. This comprehensive legislation will provide the Coast Guard with needed resources to carry out missions critical to our Nation's security, environmental protection, and fisheries enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Coast Guard plays a critical role in keeping our oceans, coasts, and waterways safe, secure, and free from environmental harm. After September 11 and Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard has been a source of strength. As marine traffic grows, the number of security threats in our ports increases. Climate change is raising the stakes of another Katrina happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard faces many challenges, and those serving in the Coast Guard routinely serve with discipline and courage. From saving lives during natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to protecting our shores in a post-9/11 world, the Coast Guard has served America well, and continues to serve us every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, maritime smugglers transport thousands of aliens to the U.S. with virtual impunity because the existing law does not sufficiently punish or deter such conduct. During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, over 840 mariners made $13.9 million smuggling people into the U.S. illegally. Less than 3 percent of those who were interdicted were referred for prosecution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill gives the Coast Guard the authority it needs to prosecute mariners who intentionally smuggle aliens on board their vessels with a reckless disregard of our laws. It also provides protection for legitimate mariners who encounter stowaways or those who may need medical attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation relies heavily on polar icebreakers to conduct missions in the Arctic and Antarctic. They conduct vital research on the oceans and climate, resupply U.S. outposts in Antarctica, and provide one of our Nation's only platforms for carrying out security and rescue missions in some of the world's most rapidly changing environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the United States' icebreaking capabilities lie with the Coast Guard's three vessels: the HEALY; the Polar Sea; and the Polar Star. But the fleet is aging rapidly and requires extensive maintenance. In fact, the Polar Star is currently not even operational because the Coast Guard lacks the resources required to maintain this vessel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With increased climate change, the role of icebreakers is changing. With an ice-free Arctic summer expected by 2050, more and more international expeditions will be headed to the region to examine newly revealed oil and gas reserves and other natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canada, Russia and other countries will begin to compete with America over jurisdiction and, without a strong polar icebreaker fleet, our Nation will suffer a severe disadvantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent 2007 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that the U.S. needs to maintain polar icebreaking capacity and construct at least two new polar icebreakers. This bill follows those recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes many provisions of the Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2007, which I introduced on June 14, 2007. These provisions are vital for the environmental protection of our Nation's oceans and coasts. For example, this bill would require improved coordination with federally-recognized tribes on oil spill prevention, preparedness, and response. It would also address oil spills resulting from the transfer of oil to or from vessels, spills resulting from human error, and  small oil spills that are an all-too-common occurrence in many of our waterways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For my home State of Washington, it provides a mechanism for year-round funding of the Neah Bay response tug, a key element of the oil spill prevention safety net for Washington State's Olympic Coast. It would also increase oil spill preparedness in the Strait of Juan de Fuca by changing the definition of "High Volume Port Line" so as to deliver better incident response throughout Puget Sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard is responsible for ensuring our country's security, marine safety and protecting our environment and fisheries. Every day the Coast Guard carries out these missions and does so with limited resources. It is our job to ensure the Coast Guard has the tools it requires to continue getting the job done. This bill will go a long way towards that goal. I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as Ranking Member on the Coast Guard's oversight subcommittee, I am pleased today to co-sponsor the Coast Guard Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard serves as the guardian of our maritime homeland security and provides many critical services for our nation. Last year alone, the Coast Guard responded to over 28,000 calls for assistance, and saved nearly 5,300 lives. These brave men and women risk their lives to defend our borders from drugs, illegal immigrants, acts of terror, and other national security threats. In 2004, the Coast Guard seized 287,000 pounds of cocaine, including over 20 tons in a single interdiction action,  the largest drug bust ever recorded. They also stopped nearly 8,000 illegal migrants from reacting our shores. In addition they conducted 6,100 boardings to protect our vital fisheries stocks and they responded to 4,400 pollution incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's post-9/11 world, the men and women of the Coast Guard have been working harder than ever securing the nation's coastline, waterways, and ports. This rapid escalation of the Coast Guard's homeland security mission catalogue continues today. While our new reality requires the Coast Guard to maintain a robust homeland security posture, these new priorities must not diminish the Coast Guard's focus on its traditional missions such as marine safety, search and rescue, aids to navigation,  fisheries law enforcement, and marine environmental protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we introduce today would authorize funding at $8.3 billion for fiscal year 2008. This authorization will continue to allow the Coast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions such as search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection, as well as fund the necessary missions related to ports, waterways, and coastal security. It also includes funding to allow the service to continue replacing its rapidly aging assets so it can increase efficiency of its  actions and reap the benefits of advances of modern technology and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard's rapid operational escalation has taken a significant toll on the ships, boats, and aircraft that the Coast Guard uses on a daily basis, putting additional strain on vessels that already collectively comprise the world's third oldest navel fleet. The Coast Guard is now 5 years into the acquisition phase of a program designed to recapitalize its aging infrastructure the Integrated Deepwater Program. In recent months, we have heard a litany of bad news regarding Deepwater, from  the decommissioning of eight 123-foot patrol boats following a failed effort to extend them, to reports that Deepwater's flagship, the National Security Cutter, will not meet the specifications required by the Coast Guard. The service has taken numerous steps to rectify contractual shortcomings that have led to many of these problems, but much work remains to be done before the Coast Guard can</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes a provision to increase the Coast Guard's ability to prosecute those engaged in illegal alien smuggling in the maritime environment. Under current law and practice, individuals have to be seriously injured or die in a maritime migrant smuggling event before the smugglers are faced with meaningful legal penalties. This allows organized groups of experienced smugglers to operate with near impunity, facilitating the entry of  thousands  of illegal immigrants annually. The Maritime Alien Smuggling Law Enforcement Act, contained within this bill would close this serious loophole at the frontline of our homeland security efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also contains provisions vital to navigation security, including a requirement that the Coast Guard continue to operate the LORAN-C navigation system. Though advances in Global Positioning System technology have allowed our mariners to receive accurate, timely positioning data, many seafarers, particularly in the northern latitudes where GPS signals are less strong, still rely on LORAN signals as a back-up to their more modern systems, or in some cases, as a primary navigation aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The service men and women of the Coast Guard do yeoman's work in support of our homeland security and to ensure the safety of the maritime domain, and this bill also contains provisions to help them in numerous ways. Provisions ensure the Government is providing adequate access to medical care for those stationed on remote islands; grants Coast Guard servicemen and women access to the armed forces retirement homes; and authorizes funding for additional facilities to improve their quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, this bill contains provisions too numerous to mention individually that support the Coast Guard's missions and enhance its ability to safeguard our homeland, our environment, and our maritime operations. I thank Senator CANTWELL and the rest of my fellow co-sponsors for all their hard work on this bill, and I ask my colleagues in this body to join me in expressing support for the valiant men and women of the Coast Guard and this bill that will facilitate execution of their appointed  missions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1893">S. 1893</bill>] Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following material regarding today's introduction of <bill type="s" number="1893">S. 1893</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, be included in the RECORD, July 26, 2007 letter from the Congressional Budget Office; and Technical Summary of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. CONGRESS,</narrative>
  <narrative>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 26, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have prepared the attached cost estimate for the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, based on the legislative language (ERN07632) that was provided by the Committee on Finance on July 26, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>CBO estimates that enacting this legislation would increase federal direct spending by $35.2 billion over the 2008-2012 period and by $71.0 billion over the 2008-2017 period. CBO and JCT estimate that net revenues would increase under the bill by $36.1 billion over the next five years and $72.8 billion over the 10-year period. A portion of that increase would be in off-budget revenues: $0.8 billion for the 2008-2012 period and $1.1 billion over the 2008-2017 period. On balance, the spending and  revenue changes would reduce federal on-budget deficits by $0.1 billion through 2012 and $0.8 billion for the 2008-2017 period. The two attached tables provide estimates of year-by-year changes and a summary of the estimated change in enrollment of children under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid.</narrative>
  <narrative>Projected spending would exceed estimated on-budget revenue increases beginning in fiscal year 2015. Pursuant to section 203 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008, CBO estimates that the changes in direct spending and revenues would cause an increase in the on-budget deficit greater than $5 billion in at least one of the 10-year periods between 2018 and 2057.</narrative>
  <narrative>CBO has reviewed the non-tax provisions of the bill--titles I through VI, excluding section 411, and title VII--for mandates and determined that they contain no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would affect the way states administer SCHIP and Medicaid, but because of the flexibility in those programs, the new requirements would not be intergovernmental mandates as UMRA defines that term. In general, state, local, and tribal governments  would benefit from the continuation of existing SCHIP grants, the creation of new grant programs, and broader flexibility and options in some programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>According to JCT, the tax provisions of the bill contain no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA. JCT has determined that the tax provisions of the bill contain a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, by increasing the excise tax rate on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The costs of that mandate would be similar to the estimated budget effects of the provision (as shown in the attached table), and thus would significantly exceed the threshold established in UMRA for private-sector  mandates in each year (the threshold is $131 million in 2007, and is adjusted annually for inflation).</narrative>
  <narrative>If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Eric Rollins and Jeanne De Sa.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

  <narrative>Current Law</narrative>
  <narrative>No provision.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision</narrative>
  <narrative>This act may be cited as the "Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007." Unless otherwise noted, this act amends, or repeals provisions of the Social Security Act. When this act references: "CHIP" it is referring to the State Children's Health Insurance Program established under Title XXI; "MEDICAID" it is referring to the program for medical assistance established under title XIX; "Secretary" it is referring to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title I--Financing of CHIP</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law</narrative>
  <narrative>Title XXI of the Social Security Act specifies the following national appropriation amounts in 2104(a) from FY 1998 to FY2007 for SCHIP:</narrative>
  <narrative>$4,295,000,000 in FY1998;</narrative>
  <narrative>$4,275,000,000 in FY 1999;</narrative>
  <narrative>$4,275,000,000 in FY2000;</narrative>
  <narrative>$4,275,000,000 in FY 2001;</narrative>
  <narrative>$3,150,000,000 in FY 2002;</narrative>
  <narrative>$3,150,000,000 in FY2003;</narrative>
  <narrative>$3,150,000,000 in FY2004;</narrative>
  <narrative>$4,050,000,000 in FY2005;</narrative>
  <narrative>$4,050,000,000 in FY2006; and</narrative>
  <narrative>$5,000,000,000 in FY2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>These amounts are alloted to states, including the District of Columbia, except for (1) 0.25% of the total annual amount is alloted to the territories and commonwealths (hereafter referred to simply as "the territories"), and (2) from FY1998 to FY2002, $60 million was set aside annually for special diabetes grants (Public Health Service Act 330B and 330C), which are now funded by direct appropriations. the territories are also alloted the following appropriation amounts in 2104(c)(4)(B):</narrative>
  <narrative>$32,000,000 in FY1999;</narrative>
  <narrative>$34,200,000 in FY2000;</narrative>
  <narrative>$34,200,000 in FY2001;</narrative>
  <narrative>$25,200,000 in FY2002;</narrative>
  <narrative>$25,200,000 in FY2003;</narrative>
  <narrative>$25,200,000 in FY2004;</narrative>
  <narrative>$32,400,000 in FY2005;</narrative>
  <narrative>$32,400,000 in FY2006; and</narrative>
  <narrative>$40,000,000 in FY2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision</narrative>
  <narrative>The following national appropriation amounts are specified for CHIP in 2104(a):</narrative>
  <narrative>$9,125,000,000 in FY 2008;</narrative>
  <narrative>$10,675,000,000 in FY2009;</narrative>
  <narrative>$11,850,000,000 in FY 2010;</narrative>
  <narrative>$13,750,000,000 in FY 2001; and</narrative>
  <narrative>$3,500,000,000 in FY2012.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law</narrative>
  <narrative>The annual SCHIP appropriation available to states, including the District of Columbia, is the amount of the total appropriation remaining after amounts set aside for the territories and, for FY1998 to FY2002, the special diabetes grants. Each state's share, or percentage, of the available appropriation is determined by a formula using the state's "number of children," as adjusted for geographic variation in health costs and subject to certain floors and a ceiling.</narrative>
  <narrative>Beginning with the FY2001 SCHIP allotment, the "number of children" is equal to (1) 50 percent of the number of children in the state who are low income (with "low income" defined as having family income below 200% of the federal poverty threshold), plus (2) 50 percent of the number of uninsured low-income children in the state. The source of data is the average of the number of such children, as reported and defined in the three most recent Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplements</narrative>
  <narrative>The adjustment for geographic variations in health costs is 85% of each state's variation from the national average in its average wages in the health services industry. The source of data is the average wages from mandatory reports filed quarterly by every employer on their unemployment insurance contributions and provided to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). A three-year average of these data is also required in the statute.</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state's "number of children," as adjusted for geographic variation in health costs, is calculated as a percentage of the national total. This is the state's preliminary proportion of the available SCHIP appropriation, against which the floors and ceiling are compared.</narrative>
  <narrative>Since the beginning of SCHIP, no state's share of the available appropriation could result in an allotment of less than $2 million. No state has ever been affected by this floor. Beginning with the FY2000 allotment, two additional floors also applied: (1) no state's share could be less than 90% of last year's share, and (2) no state's share could be less than 70% of its FY1999 share. (Each state's FY1999 share was identical to its FY1998 share, per P.L. 105-277.)</narrative>
  <narrative>A ceiling has also applied beginning with the FY2000 allotment: No state's share can exceed 145% of its FY1999 share.</narrative>
  <narrative>Once the floors and ceiling are applied to affected states to produce their adjusted proportion, the other states' shares are adjusted proportionally to use exactly 100% of the available appropriation. Each state's adjusted proportion multiplied by the appropriation available to states for a fiscal year results in each state's federal SCHIP allotment for that fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The annual CHIP funds available to states, including the District of Columbia--that is, the available national allotment--is the amount of the total appropriation remaining after amounts allotted to the territories.</narrative>
  <narrative>For FY2008, a state's allotment is calculated as 110% of the greatest of the following four amounts: (1) the state's FY2007 federal CHIP spending multiplied by the annual adjustment; (2) the state's FY2007 federal CHIP allotment multiplied by the annual adjustment; (3) for states that were determined in FY2007 to have exhausted their own federal CHIP allotments (and therefore designated a shortfall state for FY2007), the state's FY2007 projected spending as of November 2006 (or as of May 2006,  for a state whose May 2006 projection was $95 million to $96 million higher than its November 2006 projection) multiplied by the annual adjustment; and (4) the state's FY2008 federal CHIP projected spending as of August 2007 and certified by the state to the Secretary not later than September 30, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>The annual adjustment for health care cost growth and child population growth is the product of (1) 1 plus the percentage increase (if any) in the projected per capita spending in the National Health Expenditures for the fiscal year over the prior fiscal year, and (2) 1.01 plus the percentage increase in the child population (under age 19) in each  state as of July 1 of the fiscal year over the prior fiscal year's, based on the most timely and accurate published estimates from the Census Bureau.</narrative>
  <narrative>For FY2009 to FY2012, a state's allotment is calculated as 110% of its projected spending for that year, as submitted to CMS no later than August 31 of the preceding fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>For FY2008, if the state allotments as calculated exceed the available national allotment, the allotments are reduced proportionally. For FY2009 to FY2012, if the state allotments as calculated exceed the available national allotment, then the available national allotment is distributed to each state according to its percentage calculated as the sum of the following four factors:</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state's projected federal CHIP expenditures for that fiscal year (as certified by the state to the Secretary no later than the August 31 of the preceding fiscal year), calculated as a percentage of the national total, multiplied by 75%;</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state's number of low-income children (based on the most timely and accurate published estimates from the Census Bureau), calculated as a percentage of the national total, multiplied by 12 1/2 %;</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state's projected federal CHIP expenditures for the preceding fiscal year (as certified by the state to the Secretary in November of the fiscal year), calculated as a percentage of the national total, multiplied by 7 1/2 %; and</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state's actual federal CHIP expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary, calculated as a percentage of the national total, multiplied by 5%.</narrative>
  <narrative>If a state's projected CHIP expenditures for FY2009 to FY2012 are at least 10% more than the last year's allotment (excluding any reduction in states' allotments due to insufficient available national allotment) then, unless the state received approval in the prior year of a state plan amendment or waiver to expand CHIP coverage or the state received a payment from the CHIP Contingency Fund, the state must submit to the Secretary by August 31 before the fiscal year information relating to the  factors that contributed to the need for the increase in the state's allotment, as well as any other information that the Secretary may require for the state to demonstrate the need for the increase in the state's allotment. The Secretary shall notify the state in writing within 60 days after receipt of the information that (1) the projected expenditures are approved or disapproved (and if disapproved, the reasons for disapproval); or (2) specified additional information is needed. If the Secretary disapproved the projected expenditures or determined additional information is needed, the Secretary shall provide the state with a reasonable opportunity to</narrative>
  <narrative>For FY2008 allotment factors based on CHIP expenditures, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall use the most recent FY2007 expenditure data available to the Secretary before the start of FY2008. The Secretary may adjust the FY2008 allotments based on the actual expenditure data reported to CMS no later than November 30, 2007; the Secretary may not make adjustments after December 31, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>For purposes of determining a state's allotment, the state's projected expenditures shall include payments projected using &#xA7;2105(g) (discussed in Section 110) and for certain CHIP-enrolled parents and childless adults (discussed in Section 105).</narrative>

  <narrative>No provision.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>In FY 2012, a one-time appropriation of $12,500,000,000 shall be made to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add to the funds already provided under section 2104(a) for that year only. Such funds shall be distributed by the Secretary in a manner consistent with and under the same terms and conditions of section 102 of this Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>The territories were to receive 0.25 percent of the total appropriations provided in &#xA7;2104(a). Later legislation added specific appropriations for the territories in FY1999 to FY2007:</narrative>

  <narrative>For FY 1999, the $32 million represented approximately 0.75 percent of the total appropriations in &#xA7;2104(a). For FY2000 to FY2007, the additional appropriation equaled 0.8 percent of the total appropriations in &#xA7;2104(a). Combined with the 0.25 percent available through the original enacting legislation, the territories were allotted 1.05% of the total appropriations in &#xA7;2104(a) from FY2000 to FY2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>The amounts set aside for the territories were distributed according to the following percentages provided in statute: Puerto Rico, 91.6 percent; Guam, 3.5 percent; the Virgin Islands, 2.6 percent; American Samoa, 1.2 percent; and the Northern Mariana Islands, 1.1 percent.</narrative>
  <narrative>Medicaid (and SCHIP) programs in the territories are subject to spending caps specified in statute. The federal Medicaid matching rate, which determines the share if Medicaid expenditures paid for by the federal government, is statutorily set at 50 percent of the territories. Therefore, the federal government pays 50% of the cost of Medicaid items and services in the territories up to the spending caps. For the 50 states and DC, certain administrative functions have a higher federal match. For  example, startup expenses for specified computer systems are matched at 90%, and there is a 100% match for the implementation and operation of immigration status verification systems.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>From the national CHIP appropriation, the allotments to the territories are calculated as follows. For FY2008, each territory's allotment is its highest annual federal CHIP spending between FY1998 and FY2007, plus the annual adjustment for health care cost growth and national child population growth. FY2007 spending will be determined by the Secretary based on the most timely and accurate published estimates of the Census Bureau. For FY2009 through FY2012, each territory's allotment is the prior  year's allotment, plus the annual adjustment for health care cost growth and national child population growth.</narrative>
  <narrative>For FY2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, federal matching payments for specified data reporting systems (i.e., the design, development, and operations of claims processing systems and citizenship documentation data systems in each of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa would be subject to the 90% federal match rate for the start-up expenses associated with such systems and the 75% federal match rate for the operation of such systems without  regard to the specified spending caps.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress not later than September 30, 2009, with regard to the territories' eligible Medicaid and CHIP populations, their historical and projected spending and the ability of capped funding streams to address such needs, the extent to which the federal poverty level is used for determining Medicaid and CHIP eligibility in the territories, and the extent to which the territories  participate in data collection and reporting with regard to Medicaid and CHIP and specifically the extent to which they participate in the Current Population Survey versus the American Community Survey, which are federal surveys that estimate the number of low-income children in the states. The report is also to provide recommendations for improving Medicaid and CHIP funding to the territories.</narrative>

  <narrative>Incentive Pool </narrative>
  <narrative>On December 1, 2007, the amount by which states' FY2006 and FY2007 allotments not expended by September 30, 2007, exceed 50% of the federal share of the FY2008 allotment, as determined by the Secretary by not later than October 1, 2007;</narrative>
  <narrative>On each December 1 from 2008 to 2012, any of the annual CHIP appropriation not used by the states;</narrative>
  <narrative>On October 1 of fiscal years 2009 to 2012, the amount by which the unspent funds from the prior year's allotment exceeds the applicable percentage of that allotment. The applicable percentage is 20% for FY2009, and 10% for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012;</narrative>
  <narrative>Any original allotment amounts not expended by the end of their second year of availability;</narrative>
  <narrative>On October 1, 2009, any amounts set aside for transition off of CHIP coverage for childless adults that are not expended by September 30, 2009; and</narrative>
  <narrative>On October 1 of FY2009 through FY2012, any amounts in the CHIP Contingency Fund in excess of the fund's aggregate cap, as well as any Contingency Fund payments provided to a state that are unspent at the end of the fiscal year following the one in which the funds were provided.</narrative>
  <narrative>Funds from the Incentive Pool are payable in FY2008 to FY2012 to states that have increased their Medicaid and CHIP enrollment among low-income children above a defined baseline, with associated payments as follows (reduced proportionally if necessary). (For purposes of Incentive Pool policies, a "child" enrolled in Medicaid means an individual under age 19--or age 20 or 21, if a state has so elected under its Medicaid plan; and "low-income children" means children in  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="10176">S10176</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>For FY2009, the baseline monthly average is each state's average monthly enrollment in the first two quarters of FY2007 enrollment (as determined over a 6-month period on the basis of the most recent information reported through the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) multiplied by the sum of 1.02 and the percentage increase in the population of low-income children in the state from FY2007 to FY2009, as determined by the Secretary based on the most recent published estimates from the  Census Bureau before the beginning of FY2009. For FY2010 onward, the baseline monthly average is the prior year's baseline monthly average multiplied by the sum of 1.01 and the percentage increase in the population of low-income children in the state over the preceding fiscal year, as determined by the Secretary based on the most recent published estimates from the Census Bureau before the beginning of the fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>A state eligible for a bonus shall receive in the last quarter of the fiscal year the following amount, depending on the "excess" of the state's enrollment above the baseline monthly average: (i) If such excess with respect to the number of individuals who are enrolled in the State plan under title XIX does not exceed 2 percent, the product of $75 and the number of such individuals included in such excess; (ii) if such excess with respect to the number of individuals who are enrolled in the  State plan under title XIX exceeds 2 percent, but does not exceed 5 percent, the product of $300 and the number of such individuals included in such excess; and (iii) if such excess with respect to the number of individuals who are enrolled in the State plan under title XIX exceeds 5 percent, the product of $625 and the number</narrative>
  <narrative>Payments from the Incentive Pool shall be used for any purpose that the State determines is likely to reduce the percentage of low-income children in the State without health insurance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Redistribution of FY2005 Allotments </narrative>
  <narrative>FY2005 original CHIP allotments unspent at the end of FY2007 are to be redistributed on a proportional basis to states that were projected at any point in FY2007 to exhaust their federal CHIP allotments.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of HHS broad authority to modify virtually all aspects of the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Under Section 1115, the Secretary may waive requirements in Section 1902 (usually, freedom of choice of provider, comparability, and statewideness). For SCHIP, no specific sections or requirements are cited as "waive-able." SCHIP statute simply states that Section 1115, pertaining to research and demonstration projects, applies to SCHIP. States  may obtain waivers that allow them to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for SCHIP, or limit benefit packages for certain groups as long as the Secretary determines that these programs further the goals of SCHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Approved SCHIP Section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part of a state's SCHIP state plan for purposes of federal reimbursement. Costs associated with waiver programs are subject to each state's enhanced-FMAP. Under SCHIP Section 1115 waivers, states must meet an "allotment neutrality test" where combined federal expenditures for the state's regular SCHIP program and for the state's SCHIP demonstration program are capped at the state's individual SCHIP allotment. This policy limits federal spending  to the capped allotment levels.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under current law, including 1115 waiver authority, states cover pregnant women, parents of Medicaid and SCHIP eligible children and childless adults in their SCHIP programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 prohibited the approval of new demonstration programs that allow federal SCHIP funds to be used to provide coverage to nonpregnant childless adults, but allowed for the continuation and renewal of such existing Medicaid or SCHIP waiver projects affecting federal SCHIP funds that were approved under the Section 1115 waiver authority before February 8, 2006.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>Childless Adults </narrative>
  <narrative>States with applicable existing waivers (that are otherwise terminated under this provision) would be permitted to extend coverage, through FY2009, to individual nonpregnant childless adults who received coverage under the applicable existing waiver at any time during FY2008 (regardless of whether the individual lost coverage at any time during FY2008 and was later provided benefit coverage under the waiver in that fiscal year) subject to the following restrictions: (1) for each such State, the  Secretary would be required to set aside an amount as part of a separate allotment equal to the federal share of the State's projected FY2008 expenditures (as certified by the state and submitted to the Secretary by August 31, 2008) for providing coverage under the waiver to such individuals in FY2008 increased by the annual adjustment for per capita health care growth (described in Section 102 of this bill), (2) the Secretary</narrative>
  <narrative>States with existing CHIP waivers to extend coverage to nonpregnant childless adults (that are otherwise terminated under this provision) would be permitted to submit a request to CMS (not later than June 30, 2009) for a Medicaid nonpregnant childless adult waiver. For such states, the Secretary would be required to make a decision to deny or approve such application within 90 days of the date of submission. For such states, if no CMS decision to approve or deny such request has been made as  of September 30, 2009, the provision would allow such application to be deemed approved.</narrative>
  <narrative>States with applicable existing waivers that request a Medicaid nonpregnant childless adult waiver under this provision would be required to meet the following "budget neutrality" requirements. For fiscal year 2010, allowable waiver expenditures for such populations would not be permitted to exceed the total amount payments made to the State (as specified above) for FY2009, increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the projected per capita spending in the National Health Expenditures  for fiscal year 2010 over fiscal year 2009). In the case of any succeeding fiscal year, allowable waiver expenditures for such populations would not be permitted to exceed each such State's set aside amount (described above) for the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the projected per capita spending in the National Health Expenditures for such fiscal year over the prior fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>Parents</narrative>
  <narrative>States with existing CHIP waivers to extend coverage to parent(s) of targeted low-income child(ren) would be permitted to continue such assistance during each of fiscal  years 2010, 2011, and 2012 subject to the following requirements: (1) for each such State and for each such fiscal year, the Secretary would be required to set aside an amount as part of a separate allotment equal to the federal share of 110% of the State's projected expenditures (as  certified by the state and submitted to the Secretary by August 31 of the preceding fiscal year) for providing waiver coverage to such individuals enrolled in the waiver in the applicable fiscal year, and (2) the Secretary would pay the State from the set aside amount (specified above) for each such fiscal year an amount equal to the applicable percentage for expenditures in the quarter to provide coverage as specified under the waiver to parent(s) of targeted low-income child(ren).</narrative>
  <narrative>In fiscal year 2010 only, costs associated with such parent coverage would be subject to each such state's CHIP enhanced FMAP for States that meet one of the outreach or coverage benchmarks (listed below) in FY2009, or each such state's Medicaid FMAP rate for all other states. The provision would prohibit federal matching payments for the payment of services beyond the set-aside spending cap.</narrative>
  <narrative>For fiscal year 2011 or 2012, costs associated with such parent coverage would be subject to: (1) each such state's Reduced Enhanced Matching Assistance Percentage (REMAP) (i.e., a percentage which would be equal to the sum of (a) each such state's FMAP percentage and (b) the number of percentage points equal to one-half of the difference between each such state's FMAP rate and each such state's enhanced FMAP rate) if the state meets one of the coverage benchmarks (listed below) for FY2010 or  FY2011 (as applicable), or (2) each such state's FMAP rate if the state failed to meet any of the coverage benchmarks (listed below) for the applicable fiscal year. The provision would prohibit federal matching payments for the payment of services beyond the setaside spending cap.</narrative>
  <narrative>FY2010 outreach and coverage benchmarks include: (1) the state implemented a significant child outreach campaign including (a) the state was awarded an outreach and enrollment grant (under Section 201 of this bill) for fiscal year 2009, (b) the state implemented 1 or more process measures for that fiscal year, or (c) the state has submitted a specific plan for outreach for such fiscal year, (2) the state ranks in the lowest 1/3 of the States in terms of the State's percentage of low-income children  without health insurance based on timely and accurate published estimates of the Bureau of the Census, or (3) the State qualified for a payment from the Incentive Fund for the most recent coverage period.</narrative>
  <narrative>FY2011 and 2012 coverage benchmarks include: (1) the state ranks in the lowest  1/3  of the States in terms of the State's percentage of low-income children without health insurance based on timely and accurate published estimates of the Bureau of the Census, and (2) the State qualified for a payment from the Incentive Fund for the most recent coverage period.</narrative>
  <narrative>A rule of construction clarifies that states are not prohibited from submitting applications for 1115 waivers to provide medical assistance to a parent of a targeted low-income child.</narrative>
  <narrative>The General Accountability Office would be required to conduct a study to determine if the coverage of a parent, caretaker relative, or legal guardian of a targeted low-income child increases the enrollment of or quality of care for children, and if such parents, relatives, and legal guardians are more likely to enroll their children in CHIP or Medicaid. Results of the study (and report recommended changes) would be reported to appropriate committees of Congress 2 years after the date of enactment.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under SCHIP, states can cover pregnant women ages 19 and older in one of two ways: (1) via a special waiver of program rules (through Section 1115 authority), or (2) by providing coverage as permitted through regulation. In the latter case, coverage includes prenatal and delivery services only.</narrative>
  <narrative>In general, SCHIP allows states to cover targeted low-income children with family income that is above applicable Medicaid eligibility levels in a given state. States can set the upper income level up to 200% FPL, or if the applicable Medicaid income level was at or above 200% FPL before SCHIP, the upper income limit may be raised an additional 50 percentage points above that level. Other SCHIP eligibility restrictions include (1) the child must be uninsured, (2) the child must be otherwise ineligible  for regular Medicaid,</narrative>
  <narrative>Under regular Medicaid, states must provide coverage for pregnant women with income up to 133% FPL, and at state option, may extend such coverage to pregnant women with income up to 185% FPL. States must also provide coverage to first-time pregnant women with income that meets former cash assistance program rules (which were generally well below 100% FPL). The period of coverage for these mandatory and optional pregnant women is during pregnancy through the end of the month in which the 60 days  postpartum period ends. In addition, waiver authority may be used to cover pregnant women at even higher income levels and for extended periods of time (e.g., 18 or 24 months postpartum).</narrative>
  <narrative>Under regular Medicaid, states may temporarily enroll pregnant women whose family income appears to be below Medicaid income standards for up to 2 months until a final formal determination of eligibility is made. Entities that may qualify to make such presumptive eligibility determinations for pregnant women include Medicaid providers that are outpatient hospital departments, rural health clinics and certain other clinics, and other entities including certain primary care health centers and rural  health care programs funded under Sections 330 and 330A of the Public Health Service Act, grantees under the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Program, entities receiving funds under the Health Services for Urban Indians program, and entities that participate</narrative>
  <narrative>Mandatory Medicaid eligibility applies to children under age 6 in families with income at or below 133% FPL. In addition, states may cover newborns under age 1 up to 185% FPL under Medicaid. Children born to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women must be deemed to be eligible for Medicaid from the date of birth up to age 1 so long as the child is a member of the mother's household, and the mother remains eligible for Medicaid (or would remain eligible if pregnant). During this period of deemed eligibility  for the newborn, for claiming and payment purposes, the Medicaid identification (ID) number of the mother must also be used for the newborn, unless the state issues a separate ID number for the child during this period. In general, newborns may also be enrolled in SCHIP if they meet the applicable financial standards in a given state, which build on top of Medicaid's rules.</narrative>
  <narrative>For families with income below 150% FPL, premiums cannot exceed nominal amounts specified in Medicaid regulations, and service-related cost-sharing is limited to nominal Medicaid amounts for the subgroup under 100% FPL and slightly higher amounts in SCHIP regulations for the subgroup with income between 100-150% FPL.</narrative>
  <narrative>For families with income above 150% FPL, premiums and cost-sharing may be imposed in any amount as long as such costs for higher-income children are not less than the costs for lower-income children. Total premiums and cost-sharing incurred by all SCHIP children cannot exceed 5% of annual family income.</narrative>
  <narrative>Other cost-sharing protections also apply. Applicable premium and cost-sharing amounts cannot favor children from families with higher income over children in families with lower income. No cost-sharing may be applied to preventive services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would allow states to provide optional coverage under CHIP to pregnant women, through a state plan amendment, if certain conditions are met, including (1) the state has established an income eligibility level of at least 185% FPL for mandatory, welfare-related qualified pregnant women and optional poverty-related pregnant women under Medicaid, (2) the state does not apply an effective income level under the state plan amendment for pregnant women that is lower than the effective  income level (expressed as a percent of poverty and accounting for applicable income disregards) for mandatory, welfare-related qualified pregnant women and optional poverty-related pregnant women under Medicaid on the date of enactment of this provision to be eligible for Medicaid as pregnant women, (3) the state does not provide coverage for pregnant women with higher family income without covering such pregnant women with a lower family income, (4) the state provides pregnancy-related assistance (defined below) for targeted low-income pregnant women in the same manner, and subject to the same requirements, as the state provides</narrative>
  <narrative>States that elect this new optional coverage for pregnant women under CHIP and that meet all the above conditions associated with this option, may also elect to provide presumptive eligibility for pregnant women, as defined in the Medicaid statute, to targeted low-income pregnant women under CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pregnancy-related assistance would include all the services covered as child health assistance under the state's CHIP program, and includes medical assistance that would be provided to a pregnant woman under Medicaid, during pregnancy through the end of the month in which the 60 day postpartum period ends. The upper income limit for coverage of targeted low-income pregnant women under CHIP could be up to the level for coverage of targeted low-income children in the state. As with targeted low-income  children under CHIP, the new group of targeted low-income pregnant women must be determined eligible, be uninsured, and must not be an inmate of a public institution or a patient in an institution for mental disease or eligible for coverage under a state employee health</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also deem children born to the new group of targeted low-income pregnant women under CHIP to be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, as applicable.</narrative>
  <narrative>Such newborns would be covered from birth to age 1. During this period of eligibility, the mother's identification number must also be used for filing claims for the newborn, unless the state issues a separate identification number for that newborn.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also address States that provide assistance through other options. The option to provide assistance in accordance with the preceding subsections of this section shall not limit any other option for a State to provide (A) child health assistance through the application of sections 457.10, 457.350(b)(2), 457.622(c)(5), and 457.626(a)(3) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or (B) pregnancy-related services through the application of any other waiver authority (as in effect  on June 1, 2007).</narrative>
  <narrative>Any State that provides child health assistance under any authority described in paragraph (1) may continue to provide such assistance, as well as postpartum services, through the end of the month in which the 60-day period (beginning on the last day of the pregnancy) ends, in the same manner as assistance and postpartum services would be provided if provided under the State plan under title XIX, but only if the mother would otherwise satisfy the eligibility requirements that apply under the  State child health plan (other than with respect to age) during such period.</narrative>
  <narrative>A rule of construction clarifies that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to (A) infer the congressional intent regarding the legality or illegality of the content of sections of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, specified in paragraph (l)(A), or (B) modify the authority to provide pregnancy-related services under a waiver specified in paragraph (l)(B).</narrative>
  <narrative>For the new group of targeted low-income pregnant women, additional conforming amendments would prohibit cost-sharing for pregnancy-related services and waiting periods prior to enrollment or for the purpose of preventing crowd-out of private health insurance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>No provision.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>A CHIP Contingency Fund is established in the U.S. Treasury. The Contingency Fund receives deposits through a separate appropriation. For FY2009, the appropriation to the Fund is equal to 12.5% of the available national allotment for CHIP. For FY2010 through FY2012, the appropriation is such sums as are necessary for making payments to eligible states for the fiscal year, as long as the annual payments do not exceed 12.5% of that fiscal year's available national allotment for CHIP. Balances that  are not immediately required for payments from the Fund are to be invested in U.S. securities that provide addition income to the Fund, as long as the annual payments do not cause the Fund to exceed 12.5% of the available national allotment for CHIP. Amounts in</narrative>
  <narrative>Payments from the Fund are to be used only to eliminate any eligible state's shortfall (that is, the amount by which a state's available federal CHIP allotments are not adequate to cover the state's federal CHIP expenditures, on the basis of the most recent data available to the Secretary or requested from the state by the Secretary).</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary shall separately compute the shortfalls attributable to children and pregnant women, to childless adults, and to parents of low-income children. No payment from the Contingency Fund shall be made for nonpregnant childless adults. Any payments for shortfalls attributable to parents shall be made from the Fund at the relevant matching rate. Contingency funds are not transferable among allotments.</narrative>
  <narrative>Eligible states, which cannot be a territory, for a month in FY2009 to FY2012 are those that meet any of the following criteria:</narrative>
  <narrative>The state's available federal CHIP allotments are at least 95% but less than 100% of its projected federal CHIP expenditures for the fiscal year (i.e., less than 5% shortfall in federal funds), without regard to any payments provided from the Incentive Fund; or</narrative>
  <narrative>The state's available federal CHIP allotments are less than 95% of its projected federal CHIP expenditures for the fiscal year (i.e., more than 5% shortfall in federal funds) and that such shortfall is attributable to one or more of the following: (1) One or more parishes or counties has been declared a major disaster and the President has determined individual and public assistance has been warranted from the federal government pursuant to the Stafford Act, or a public health emergency was declared  by the Secretary pursuant to the Public Health Service Act; (2) the state unemployment rate is at least 5.5% during any 13 consecutive week period during the fiscal year and such rate is at least 120% of the state unemployment rate for the same period as averaged over the last three fiscal years; (3) the state experienced a recent event</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary shall make monthly payments from the Fund to all states determined eligible for a month. If the sum of the payments from the Fund exceeds the amount available, the Secretary shall reduce each payment proportionally.</narrative>
  <narrative>If a state was determined to be eligible in a given fiscal year, that does not make the state eligible in the following fiscal year. In the case of an event that occurred after July 1 of the fiscal year that resulted in the declaration of a Stafford Act or public health emergency that increased the number of uninsured low-income children as described above, any related Contingency Fund payment shall remain available until the end of the following fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary shall provide annual reports to Congress on the Contingency Fund, the payments from it, and the events that caused states to apply for payment.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>SCHIP allotments (currently through FY2007) are available for three years. Allotments unspent after three years are available for reallocation. For example, the FY2004 allotment was available through the end of FY2006; any remaining balances at the end of FY2006 were redistributed to other states.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>CHIP allotments through FY2006 are available for three years. CHIP allotments made for FY2007 through FY2012 are available for two years.</narrative>
  <narrative>Payments to states from the Incentive Pool are available until expended by the state. Payments for a month from the Contingency Fund are available through the end of the fiscal year, except in the case of an event that occurred after July 1 of the fiscal year that resulted in the declaration of a Stafford Act or public health emergency that increased the number of uninsured low-income children.</narrative>
  <narrative>States' federal CHIP expenditures on or after October 1, 2007, shall be counted first against the Contingency Funds from the earliest available month in the earliest fiscal year, then against the earliest available allotments.</narrative>
  <narrative>A State may elect, but is not required, to count CHIP expenditures against any incentive bonuses paid to the State.</narrative>
  <narrative>Expenditures for coverage of nonpregnant childless adults in FY2009 and of parents of targeted low-income children in FY2010 through FY2012 shall be counted only against the amount set aside for such coverage</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most Medicaid service expenditures. It is based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa); it has a statutory minimum of 50% and maximum of 83%. There are statutory exceptions to the FMAP formula for the District of Columbia (since FY1998) and Alaska (for FY1998-FY2007). In addition, the territories have  FMAPs set at 50% and are subject to federal spending caps.</narrative>
  <narrative>The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for SCHIP equals a state's Medicaid FMAP increased by the number of percentage points that is equal to 30% multiplied by the number of percentage points by which the FMAP is less than 100%. For example, in states with an FMAP of 60%, the E-FMAP equals the FMAP increased by 12 percentage points (60% + [30% multiplied by 40 percentage points] = 72%). The E-FMAP has a statutory minimum of 65% and maximum of 85%.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>For child health assistance or health benefits coverage furnished in any fiscal year inning with FY2008 to a targeted low-income child whose effective family income would exceed 300% of the federal poverty line but for the application of a general exclusion of  a block of income that is not determined by type of expense or type of income, states would be reimbursed using the FMAP instead of the E-FMAP for services provided to that child. An exception  would be provided for states that, on the date of enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007 has an approved State plan amendment or waiver or has enacted a State law to submit a State plan amendment to provide child health assistance or health benefits under their state child health plan or its waiver of such plan to children above 300% of the poverty line.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 2105(g) of the Social Security Act permits qualifying states to apply federal SCHIP funds toward the coverage of certain children already enrolled in regular Medicaid (that is, not SCHIP-funded expansions of Medicaid). Specifically, these federal SCHIP funds are used to pay the difference between SCHIP's enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and the Medicaid FMAP that the state is already receiving for these children. Funds under this provision may only be claimed for  expenditures occurring after August 15, 2003.</narrative>
  <narrative>Qualifying states are limited in the amount they can claim for this purpose to the lesser of the following two amounts: (1) 20% of the state's original SCHIP allotment amounts (if available) from FY1998, FY1999, FY2000, FY2001, FY2004, FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 (hence the "terms "20% allowance" and "20% spending"); and (2) the state's available balances of those allotments. If there is no balance, states may not claim Section 2105(g) spending.</narrative>
  <narrative>The statutory definitions for qualifying states capture most of those that had expanded their upper-income eligibility levels for children in their Medicaid programs to 185% of the federal poverty level or higher prior to the enactment of SCHIP. Based on statutory definitions, 11 states were determined to be qualifying states: Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.</narrative>
  <narrative>SCHIP spending under &#xA7;2105(g) can be used by qualifying states only for Medicaid enrollees (excluding those covered by an SCHIP-funded expansion of Medicaid) who are under age 19 and whose family income exceeds 150% of poverty, to pay the difference between the SCHIP enhanced FMAP and the regular Medicaid FMAP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>Qualifying states under &#xA7;2105(g) may also use available balances from their CHIP allotments from FY2008 to FY2012 to pay the difference between the regular Medicaid FMAP and the CHIP enhanced FMAP for Medicaid enrollees under age 19 (or age 20 or 21, if the state has so elected in its Medicaid plan) whose family income exceeds 133% of poverty.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title II--A Outreach and Enrollment</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>The federal and state governments share in the costs of both Medicaid and SCHIP, based on formulas defining the federal contribution in federal law. States are responsible for the non-federal share, using state tax revenues, for example, but can also use local government funds to comprise a portion of the non-federal share. Generally, the non-federal share of costs under Medicaid and SCHIP cannot be comprised of other federal funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under Medicaid, there are no caps on administrative expenses that may be claimed for federal matching dollars. Title XXI specifies that federal SCHIP funds can be used for SCHIP health insurance coverage, called child health assistance, which meets certain requirements. Apart from these benefit payments; SCHIP payments for four other specific health care activities can be made, including: (1) other child health assistance for targeted low-income children; (2) health services initiatives to improve  the health of SCHIP children and other low-income children; (3) outreach activities; and (4) other reasonable administrative costs. For a given fiscal year, payments for other specific health care activities cannot exceed 10% of the total amount of expenditures for SCHIP benefits and other specific health care activities combined.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would establish a new grant program under CHIP to finance outreach and enrollment efforts that increase participation of eligible children in both Medicaid and CHIP. For the purpose of awarding grants, the provision would appropriate $100 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. These amounts would be in addition to amounts appropriated for CHIP allotments to states (as per Section 2104 of the CHIP statute) and would not be subject to restrictions on expenditures for outreach  activities under current law.</narrative>
  <narrative>For each fiscal year, the provision would require that ten percent of the funds appropriated for this new grant would be set aside to finance a national enrollment campaign (described below), and an additional 10 percent would be set-side to be used by the Secretary to award grants to Indian Health Service providers and Urban Indian Organizations that receive funds under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act for outreach to, and enrollment of, children who are Indians.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require the Secretary to develop and implement a national enrollment campaign to improve the enrollment of under-served child populations in Medicaid and CHIP. Such a campaign may include: (1) the establishment of partnerships with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Agriculture to develop national campaigns to link the eligibility and enrollment systems for the programs each Secretary administers that often serve the same children, (2) the integration of information  about Medicaid and CHIP in public health awareness campaigns administered by the Secretary, (3) increased financial and technical support for enrollment hotlines maintained by the Secretary to ensure that all states participate in such hotlines, (4) the establishment of joint public awareness outreach initiatives with the Secretary of Education and the</narrative>
  <narrative>In awarding grants, the Secretary would be required to give priority to entities that propose to target geographic areas with high rates of eligible but not enrolled children who reside in rural areas, or racial and ethnic minorities and health disparity populations, including proposals that address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment, and which submit the most demonstrable evidence that (1) the entity includes members with access to, and credibility with, ethnic or low-income populations  in the targeted communities, and (2) the entity has the ability to address barriers to enrollment (e.g., lack of awareness of eligibility, stigma concerns, punitive fears associated with receipt of benefits) as well as other cultural barriers to applying for and receiving coverage under CHIP or Medicaid.</narrative>
  <narrative>To receive grant funds, eligible entities would be required to submit an application to the Secretary in such form and manner, and containing such information as the Secretary chooses. As noted above, such applications must include evidence that the entity (a) includes members with access to, and credibility with, ethnic or low-income populations in the targeted communities, and (b) has the ability to address barriers to enrollment (e.g., lack of awareness of eligibility, stigma concerns, punitive  fears associated with receipt of benefits) as well as other cultural barriers to applying for and receiving CHIP or Medicaid benefits. The applicable must also include specific quality or outcome performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of activities funded by the grant. In addition, the applicable must contain an assurance that the entity will (1) conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of such activities against the performance measures, (2) cooperate with the collection and reporting of enrollment data and other information</narrative>
  <narrative>Seven types of entities would be eligible to receive grants, including (1) a state with an approved CHIP plan, (2) a local government, (3) an Indian tribe or tribal consortium, a tribal organization, an urban Indian organization receiving funds under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, or an Indian Health Service provider, (4) a federal health safety net organization, (5) a national, local, or community-based public or nonprofit organization, including organizations that use community  health workers or community-based doula programs, (6) a faith-based organization or consortia, to the extent that a grant awarded to such an entity is consistent with requirements of section 1955 of the Public Health Service Act relating to a grant award to non-governmental entities, or (7) an elementary or secondary school.</narrative>
  <narrative>Federal health safety net organizations include a number of different types of entities, including for example: (1) federally qualified health centers, (2) hospitals that receive disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments, (3) entities described in Section 340B(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (e.g., certain family planning projects,  certain grantees providing early intervention services for HIV disease, certain comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic treatment centers, and certain Native Hawaiian health centers), and (4) any other entity or consortium that serves children under a federally-funded program, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Head Start programs, school lunch programs, and elementary or secondary schools.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision defines "community health worker" as an individual who promotes health or nutrition within the community in which the individual resides by (1) serving as a liaison between communities and health  care agencies, (2) providing guidance and social assistance to residents, (3) enhancing residents' ability to effectively communicate with health care providers, (4) providing culturally and linguistically appropriate health or nutrition education,</narrative>
  <narrative>In the case of a State that is awarded an Outreach and Enrollment grant, the State would be required to meet a maintenance of effort requirement with regard to the state share of funds spent on outreach and enrollment activities under the CHIP state plan. For such states, the funds spent on outreach and enrollment under the state plan for a fiscal year would not permitted to be less than the State share of funds spent in the fiscal year preceding the first fiscal year for which the grant is awarded.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would add translation and interpretation services to the specific health care activities that can be reimbursed under CHIP. Translation or interpretation services in connection with the enrollment and use of services under CHIP by individuals for whom English is not their primary language (as found by the Secretary for the proper and efficient administration of the state plan) would be matched at either 75% or the sum of the enhanced FMAP for the state plus five percentage points,  whichever is higher.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the 10% limit on payments for other specific health care activities in current CHIP statute would not apply to expenditures for outreach and enrollment activities funded under this section.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Agreements with States for Medicaid and CHIP Outreach on or Near Reservations to Increase the Enrollment of Indians in Those Programs</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>No provision in the Social Security Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 404(a) of the IHCIA requires the Secretary to make grants or enter into contracts with Tribal Organizations for establishing and administering programs on or near federal Indian reservations and trust areas and in or near Alaska Native villages. The purpose of the programs is to assist individual Indians to enroll in Medicare, apply for Medicaid and pay monthly premiums for coverage due to financial need of such individuals. Section 404(b) of the IHCIA directs the Secretary, through the  IHS, to set conditions for any grant or contract. The conditions include, but are not limited to: (1) determining the Indian population that is, or could be, served by Medicare and Medicaid; (2) assisting individual Indians to become familiar with and use benefits; (3) providing transportation to Indians to the appropriate offices to enroll or apply for medical assistance; and (4) developing and implementing both an income schedule to determine premium payment levels for coverage of needy individuals</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would amend Section 1139 of the Social Security Act (replacing the current Section 1139 provision dealing with an expired National Commission on Children).</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would encourage states to take steps to provide for enrollment of Indians residing on or near a reservation in Medicaid and CHIP. The steps could include outreach efforts such as: outstationing of eligibility workers; entering into agreements with the IHS, Indian Tribes (ITs), Tribal Organizations (TOs), and Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) to provide outreach; education regarding eligibility, benefits, and enrollment; and translation services. The provision would not affect the  arrangements between states and Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations to conduct administrative activities under Medicaid and CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require the Secretary, acting through CMS, to take such steps as necessary to facilitate cooperation with and agreements between states, and the IHS, ITs, TOs, or UIOs relating to the provision of benefits to Indians under Medicaid and CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would specify that the following terms have the meanings given to these terms in Section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act: Indian, Indian Tribe, Indian Health Program, Tribal Organization, and Urban Indian Organization.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Nonapplication of 10 Percent Limit On Outreach and Certain Other Expenditures</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Title XXI of the Social Security Act provides states with annual federal SCHIP allotments based on a formula set in law. State SCHIP payments are matched by the federal government at an enhanced rate that builds on the base rate applicable to Medicaid. The SCHIP statute also specifies that federal SCHIP funds can be used for SCHIP health insurance coverage, called child health assistance that meets certain requirements. States may also provide benefits to SCHIP children, called targeted low-income  children, through enrollment in Medicaid. Apart from these benefit payments, SCHIP payments for four other specific health care activities can be made, including: (1) other child health assistance for targeted low-income children; (2) health services initiatives to improve the health of targeted low-income children and other low-income children; (3) outreach activities; and</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would exclude from the 10% cap on CHIP payments for the four other specific health care activities described above: (1) expenditures for outreach activities to families of Indian children likely to be eligible for CHIP or Medicaid, or under related waivers, and (2) related informing and enrollment assistance activities for Indian children under such programs, expansions, or waivers, including such activities conducted under grants, contracts, or agreements entered into under Section  1139 of this Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Medicaid law and regulations contain requirements regarding determinations of eligibility and applications for assistance. Generally, the Medicaid agency must determine the eligibility of each applicant no more than 90 days from the date of application for disability-based applications and 45 days for all other applications. The agency must assure that eligibility for care and services under the plan is determined in a manner consistent with the best interests of the recipients.</narrative>
  <narrative>In limited circumstances outside agencies are permitted to determine eligibility for Medicaid. For example, when a joint TANF-Medicaid application is used the state TANF agency may make the Medicaid eligibility determination, or the Secretary may enter into an agreement with a given state to allow the Social Security Administration (SSA) to determine Medicaid eligibility of aged, blind, or disabled individuals in that state.</narrative>
  <narrative>Applicants must attest to the accuracy of the information submitted on their Medicaid applications, and sign application forms under penalty of perjury. Each state  must have an income and eligibility verification system under which (1) applicants for Medicaid and several other specified government programs must furnish their Social Security numbers to the state as a condition for eligibility, and (2) wage information from various specified government agencies is used to verify eligibility and to determine the amount of available benefits. Subsequent to initial application, states must request information from other federal and state agencies, to verify</narrative>
  <narrative>With regard to criteria for State Personnel Administration and Offices, current law requires each state plan to establish and maintain methods of personnel administration in accordance with the Administration of the Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration, 5 CFR Part 900, Subpart F. States must assure compliance with the standards by local jurisdictions; assure that the U.S. Civil Service Commission has reviewed and determined the adequacy of state laws, regulations, and policies;  obtain statements of acceptance of the standards by local agencies; submit materials to show compliance with these standards when requested by HHS; and have in effect an affirmative action plan, which includes specific action steps and timetables, to assure equal employment opportunity.</narrative>
  <narrative>SCHIP defines a targeted low-income child as one who is under the age of 19 years with no health insurance, and who would not have been eligible for Medicaid under the rules in effect in the state on March 31, 1997. Federal law requires that eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP be coordinated when states implement separate SCHIP programs. In these circumstances, applications for SCHIP coverage must first be screened for Medicaid eligibility.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules, states are allowed to temporarily enroll children whose family income appears to be below Medicaid income standards for up  to 2 months until a final formal determination of eligibility is made. Entities qualified to make presumptive eligibility determinations for children include Medicaid providers, agencies that determine eligibility for Head Start, subsidized child care, or the Special Supplemental Food  Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). BIPA 2000 added several entities to the list of those qualified to make Medicaid presumptive eligibility determinations. These include agencies that determine eligibility for Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); certain elementary and secondary schools; state or tribal child support enforcement</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would create a three year demonstration program that would allow up to 10 states to use Express Lane at Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment and renewal. The demonstration would provide $44 million for systems upgrades and implementation (not coverage costs) and $5 million for an independent evaluation of the demonstration at the end of three years and a report on the demonstration's effectiveness to Congress. The report would be due one year after completion of the demonstration.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Demonstration would allow states the option to rely on a finding made by an Express Lane Agency within the preceding 12 months to determine whether a child under age 19 (or at state option age 20, or 21) has met one or more of the eligibility requirements (e.g., income, assets or resources, citizenship, or other criteria) necessary to determine an individual's initial eligibility, eligibility redetermination, or renewal of eligibility for medical assistance under Medicaid (including the waiver  of requirements of this title).</narrative>
  <narrative>If a finding from an Express Lane agency results in a child not being found eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, the State would be required to determine Medicaid or CHIP eligibility using its regular procedures. The provision does not relieve states of their obligation to determine eligibility for medical assistance under Medicaid, or prohibit state options intended to increase enrollment of eligible children under Medicaid or CHIP. In addition, the provision requires states to inform the families</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would allow States to rely on an Express Lane Agency finding that a child is a qualified alien as long as the Agency complies with guidance and regulatory procedures issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security for eligibility determinations of qualified aliens, and verifications of immigration status (that meet the requirements of Section 301 of this bill).</narrative>
  <narrative>States that opt to use an Express Lane Agency to determine eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP may meet the CHIP screen and enroll requirements by using any of the following requirements: (1) establishing a threshold percentage of the Federal poverty level that is 30 percentage points (or such other higher number of percentage points) as the state determines reflects the income methodologies of the program administered by the Express Lane Agency and the Medicaid State plan, (2) providing that the  child satisfies all income requirements for Medicaid eligibility, or (3) providing that such child has a family income that exceeds the Medicaid income eligibility threshold that serves as the lower income eligibility threshold for CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would allow states to provide for presumptive eligibility under CHIP for a child who, based on an eligibility determination of an income finding from an Express Lane agency, would qualify for child health assistance under CHIP. During the period of presumptive eligibility, the State may determine the child's eligibility for CHIP based on telephone contact with family members, access to data available in electronic or paper format, or other means that minimize to the maximum extent  feasible the burden on the family.</narrative>
  <narrative>A State may initiate a Medicaid eligibility determination (and determine program eligibility) without a program application based on data obtained from sources other than the child (or the child's family), but such child can only be automatically enrolled in Medicaid (or CHIP) if the family affirmatively consented to being enrolled through affirmation and signature on an Express Lane agency application. The provision requires the State to have procedures in place to inform the individual of the  services that will be covered, appropriate methods for using such services, premium or other cost sharing charges (if any) that apply, medical support obligations created by the enrollment (if applicable), and the actions the individual must take to maintain enrollment and renew coverage. For children who consent to enrollment in the State plan, the provision would allow the State to waive signature requirements on behalf of such child.</narrative>
  <narrative>States that participate in the Express Lane Eligibility Demonstration would not be required to direct a child (or a child's family) to submit information or documentation previously submitted by the child or family to an Express Lane agency that the State relies on for its Medicaid eligibility determination. A participating state may rely on information from an Express Lane agency when evaluating a child's eligibility for Medicaid or SCHIP without a separate, independent confirmation of the information  at the time of enrollment.</narrative>
  <narrative>An Express Lane agency must be a public agency determined by the State agency to be capable of making the determinations described in the provisions of this section and is identified in the state plan under this title or Title XXI. Express Lane Agencies would include: (1) a public agency that determines eligibility for assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV, a program funded under Part D of title IV, a State child health plan under title XXI, the Food Stamp Act of 1977,  the Head Start Act, the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, or the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the Steward B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996,</narrative>
  <narrative>Programs run through Title XX (SSBG) are not eligible Express Lane agencies. Private for-profit organizations are not eligible Express Lane agencies. Current law applies regarding the ability of Medicaid to contract with non-profit and for-profit agencies to administer the Medicaid application process with clarifying language that nothing in this demonstration exempts states from the merit-based system for Medicaid employees. A rule of construction would also clarify that states may not use the  Express Lane option as a means of avoiding current merit-based employment requirements for Medicaid determinations.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the provision would require such agencies to notify the child's family (1) of the information that will be disclosed under this provision, (2) that the information will be used solely for the purposes of determining eligibility under Medicaid and CHIP, (3) that the family may elect not to have the information disclosed for such purposes. The Express Lane agency must also enter into or be subject to an interagency agreement to limit the disclosure and use of such information.</narrative>
  <narrative>As part of the demonstration, signatures under penalty of perjury would not be required on a Medicaid application form attesting to any element of the application for which eligibility is based on information received from a source other than an applicant. The provision would provide that any signature requirement for a Medicaid application may be satisfied through an electronic signature.</narrative>
  <narrative>States participating in the Demonstration will have to code which children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP by way of Express Lane for the duration of the demonstration. States must take a statistically valid sample, approved by CMS, of the children enrolled via Express Lane annually for full Medicaid eligibility review to determine eligibility error rate. States submit the error rate to CMS and if the error rate exceeds 3% either of the first two years, the state must show CMS what corrective  actions are in place to improve upon their error rate and will be required to reimburse erroneous excess payments that exceed the allowable error rate of 3%. However, CMS does not have the authority to apply the error rate derived from the Express Lane sample to the entire Express Lane or Medicaid child population, or</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Each state must have an income and eligibility verification system under which (1) applicants for Medicaid and several other specified government programs must furnish their Social Security numbers to the state as a condition for eligibility, and (2) wage information from various specified government agencies is used to verify eligibility and to determine the amount of available benefits. Subsequent to initial application, states must request information from other federal and state agencies,  to verify applicants' income, resources, citizenship status, and validity of Social Security number (e.g., income from the Social Security Administration (SSA), unearned income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), unemployment information from the appropriate state agency, qualified aliens must present documentation of their immigration status, which</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would authorize federal or State agencies or private entities with potential data sources relevant for the determination of eligibility under Medicaid (e.g., eligibility files, vital records about births, etc.) to share such information with the Medicaid agency if: (1) the child (or such child's parent, guardian, or caretaker relative) has provided advanced consent to disclosure, and has not objected to disclosure, (2) such data are used solely for the purpose of identifying, enrolling,  and verifying potential eligibility for Medicaid medical assistance, and (3) an interagency agreement prevents the unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification of such data, and otherwise meets federal standards for safeguarding privacy and data security, and requires the State agency to use such data for the purposes of child enrollment in Medicaid. The provision would impose criminal penalties for persons who engage in unauthorized activities with such data.</narrative>
  <narrative>For purposes of the Express Lane Demonstration only, the provision would also authorize the Medicaid and CHIP programs to receive data directly relevant to eligibility determinations and determining the correct amount of benefits under such program from (1) the National New Hires Database, (2) the National Income Data collected by the Commissioner of Social Security, or (3) data about enrollment in insurance that may help to facilitate outreach and enrollment under Medicaid, CHIP and certain  other programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title III--Removal of Barriers to Enrollment</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>To be eligible for the full range of benefits offered under Medicaid, an individual must be a citizen or national of the United States or a qualified alien. Nonqualified aliens can only receive limited emergency Medicaid benefits. Noncitizens who apply for full Medicaid benefits have been required since 1986 to present documentation that indicates a "satisfactory immigration status."</narrative>
  <narrative>Due to recent changes in federal law, citizens and nationals also must present documentation that proves citizenship and documents personal identity in order for states to receive federal Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to them. This citizenship documentation requirement was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171) and modified by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432). Before the DRA, states could accept self-declaration of citizenship  for Medicaid, although some chose to require additional supporting evidence.</narrative>
  <narrative>The citizenship documentation requirement is outlined under Section 1903(x) of the Social Security Act and applies to Medicaid eligibility determinations and redeterminations made on or after July 1, 2006. The law specifies documents that are acceptable for this purpose and exempts certain groups from the requirement, including people who receive Medicare benefits, Social Security benefits on the basis of a disability, Supplemental Security Income benefits, child welfare assistance under Title  IV-B of the Social Security Act, or adoption or foster care assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. An interim final rule on the requirement was issued in July 2006, and a final rule was issued in July 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>The citizenship documentation requirement does not apply to SCHIP. However, some states use the same enrollment procedures for all Medicaid and SCHIP applicants. As a result, it is possible that some SCHIP enrollees would be asked to present evidence of citizenship.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>As part of its Medicaid state plan and with respect to individuals declaring to be U.S. citizens or nationals for purposes of establishing Medicaid eligibility, a state would be required to provide that it satisfies existing Medicaid citizenship documentation rules under Section 1903(x) or new rules under Section 1902(dd). The Secretary would not be allowed to waive this requirement.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under a new Section 1902(dd), a state could meet its Medicaid state plan requirement for citizenship documentation by: (1) submitting the name and Social Security number (SSN) of an individual to the Commissioner of Social Security as part of a plan established under specified rules and (2) in the case of an individual whose name or SSN is invalid, providing the individual with an opportunity to cure the invalid determination with the Social Security Administration, followed by 90 days to present  evidence of citizenship as defined in Section 1903(x) and disenrolling the individual within 30 days after the end of the 90-day period if evidence is not provided.</narrative>
  <narrative>A state opting for name and SSN validation would be required to establish a program under which it submits each month to the Commissioner of Social Security for verification of the name and SSN of each individual enrolled in Medicaid that month who has attained the age of 1 before the date of the enrollment. In establishing its program, a state could enter into an agreement with the Commissioner to provide for the electronic submission and verification of name and SSN before an individual is  enrolled in Medicaid.</narrative>
  <narrative>At such times and in such form as the Secretary may specify, states would be required to provide information on the percentage of invalid names and SSNs submitted each month. If the average monthly percentage for any fiscal year is greater than 7%, the state shall develop and adopt a corrective plan and pay the Secretary an amount equal to total Medicaid payments for the fiscal year for individuals who provided invalid information multiplied by the ratio of the number of individuals with invalid  information in excess of the 7% limited divided by the total number of individuals with invalid information. The Secretary could waive, in certain limited cases, all or part of such payment if a state is unable to reach the allowable error rate despite a good faith effort by</narrative>
  <narrative>States would receive 90% reimbursement for costs attributable to the design, development, or installation of such mechanized verification and information retrieval systems as the Secretary determines are necessary to implement name and SSN validation, and 75% for the operation of such systems.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also clarify requirements under the existing Section 1903(x). It would add "a document issued by a federally-recognized Indian tribe evidencing membership or enrollment in, or affiliation with, such tribe" to the list of documents that provide satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship or nationality, except for tribes located within states having an international border whose membership includes noncitizens, who would only be allowed to use such documents until the  Secretary of HHS issues regulations authorizing the presentation of other evidence. It would require states to provide citizens with the same reasonable opportunity to present evidence that is provided under Section 1137(d)(4)(A) to noncitizens who must present evidence of satisfactory immigration status. Groups that are exempt from the Section 1903(x) citizenship documentation requirement would</narrative>
  <narrative>In order to receive reimbursement for an individual who has, or is, declared to be a U.S. citizen or national for purposes of establishing CHIP eligibility, a state would be required to meet the Medicaid state plan requirement for citizenship documentation described above. The 90% and 75% reimbursement for name and SSN validation would be available under SCHIP, and would not count towards a state's CHIP administrative expenditures cap.</narrative>
  <narrative>Except for technical amendments made by the provision and the application of citizenship documentation to CHIP, which would be effective upon enactment, the provision would be effective as if included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. States would be allowed to provide retroactive eligibility for certain individuals who had been determined ineligible under previous citizenship documentation rules.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>During the implementation of SCHIP states instituted a variety of enrollment facilitation and outreach strategies to bring eligible children into Medicaid and SCHIP. As a result, substantial progress was made at the state level to simplify the application and enrollment processes to find, enroll, and maintain eligibility among those eligible for the program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require the State plan to describe the procedures used to reduce the administrative barriers to the enrollment of children and pregnant women in Medicaid and CHIP, and to ensure that such procedures are revised as often as the State determines is appropriate to reduce newly identified barriers to enrollment. States would be deemed to comply with the above-listed requirement if (1) the State's application and renewal forms, and information verification processes are the same  under Medicaid and CHIP for establishing and renewing eligibility for children and pregnant women, and (2) the state does not require a face-to-face interview during the application process.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title IV--Elmination of Barriers to Providing Premium Assistance</narrative>
  <narrative>Subtitle A--Additional State Option for Providing Premium Assistance</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under Medicaid, a provision in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 created the health insurance premium payment (HIPP) program. The original HIPP provision required state Medicaid programs to pay a Medicaid beneficiary's share of costs  for group (employer-based) health coverage for any Medicaid enrollee for whom employer-based coverage is available when that coverage is both comprehensive and cost effective for the state. An individual's  enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost effective if paying the premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations of the employer plan is less expensive than the state's expected cost of directly providing Medicaid-covered services. Under the original provision, states were also required to purchase employer-based health insurance for non-Medicaid eligible family members if such family coverage was necessary for Medicaid-eligible individual</narrative>
  <narrative>Under SCHIP, the Secretary has the authority to approve funding for the purchase of "family coverage" if it is cost effective relative to the amount paid to cover only the targeted low-income children and does not substitute for coverage under group health plans that would otherwise be provided to the children. While the term "family coverage" is not specifically defined in the statute, it has been interpreted to refer to either coverage for the entire family under an SCHIP program or under  an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. In addition, states using SCHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums must ensure that SCHIP minimum benefits are provided and SCHIP cost-sharing ceilings are met.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because of these requirements, implementation of premium assistance programs under Medicaid and SCHIP are not widespread. States cited difficulty in identifying potential enrollees, determining whether the subsidy would be cost-effective, and obtaining necessary information (e.g., information about the availability of employer-sponsored plans, covered benefits, available contributions, and the remaining costs) as some of the barriers to the implementation of such programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>In August 2001, the Bush Administration introduced the Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) Initiative under the Section 1115 waiver authority. Under HIFA, states were to direct unspent SCHIP funds to extend coverage to uninsured populations with annual income less than 200% FPL and to use Medicaid and SCHIP funds to pay premium costs for waiver enrollees who have access to Employer Sponsored Insurance (ESI). This resulted in an increased emphasis on states' use of the Section  1115 waiver authority to offer premium assistance for employer-based health coverage in lieu of full Medicaid and/or SCHIP coverage. ESI programs approved under the Section 1115 waiver authority are not subject to the same current law constraints required under Medicaid's HIPP program or SCHIP's family coverage variance option (i.e., the comprehensiveness and cost-effectiveness tests).</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would allow states to offer a premium assistance subsidy for qualified employer sponsored coverage to all targeted low-income children who are eligible for child health assistance and have access to such coverage. Qualified employer sponsored coverage would be defined as a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer that (1) qualifies as credible health coverage as a group health plan under the Public Health Service Act, (2) for which the employer  contributes at least 40 percent toward the cost of the premium, and (3) is non-discriminatory in a manner similar to section 105(h) of the Internal Revenue Code but would not allow employers to exclude workers who had less than 3 years of service. Qualified</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would establish a new cost effectiveness test for ESI programs. A group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer would be considered qualified employer sponsored coverage if the state establishes that (1) the cost of such coverage is less than the expenditures that the State would have made to enroll the child or the family (as applicable) in CHIP, or (2) the State establishes that the aggregate amount of State expenditures for the purchase of all such  coverage for targeted low-income children under CHIP (including administrative expenses) does not exceed the aggregate amount of expenditures that the State would have made for providing coverage under the CHIP state plan for all such children.</narrative>
  <narrative>Premium assistance subsidies would be considered child health assistance for the purpose of making federal matching payments under the CHIP program, and the state would be considered a secondary payor for any items or services provided under ESI coverage. The provision defines premium assistance subsidies as an amount equal to the difference between the employee contribution for the employee only, and the employee contribution for the employee and CHIP-eligible child, less applicable premium  cost sharing imposed under title XXI (including the employee contribution toward the 5 percent total annual aggregate cost-sharing limit under CHIP). States would be permitted to provide a premium assistance subsidy as reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses directly to an employee, or directly to the employer. At the employer's option, the provision permits the employer to notify the</narrative>
  <narrative>States would be required to provide supplemental coverage for each targeted low income child enrolled in the ESI plan consisting of items or services that are not covered, or are only partially covered, and cost-sharing protections consistent with the requirements of CHIP. States would be permitted to directly pay out-of-pocket expenditures for cost-sharing imposed under the qualified ESI coverage and collect all (or any) portion for cost-sharing imposed on the family.</narrative>
  <narrative>Waiting periods (to prevent crowd-out of private coverage with public coverage) imposed under the CHIP state plan would also apply to premium assistance coverage.  Parents would be permitted to disenroll their child(ren) from ESI coverage and enroll them in CHIP coverage effective on the first day of any month for which the child is eligible for such coverage.</narrative>
  <narrative>States that provide ESI coverage to parents of targeted low-income children, would be permitted to offer a premium assistance subsidy to eligible parents in the same manner as that State offers such subsidy to eligible child(ren). The amount of the premium subsidy would be increased to take into account the cost of enrollment of the parent in the ESI coverage, or at state option, the cost of the enrollment of the child's family (if the states determines that it is cost-effective).</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state has the option to establish an employer/family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have at least one CHIP-eligible employee (pregnant woman) or child.</narrative>
  <narrative>The state, or a state designated entity, will identify and offer access to not less than two privately delivered health products that meet the CHIP benefits benchmark.</narrative>
  <narrative>States that provide ESI coverage to parents of targeted low-income children, would be permitted to offer a premium assistance subsidy to eligible parents in the same manner as that State offers such subsidy to eligible child(ren). The amount of the premium subsidy would be increased to take into account the cost of enrollment of the parent in the ESI coverage, or at state option, the cost of the enrollment of the child's family (if the states determines that it is cost-effective).</narrative>
  <narrative>This provision would not limit the state's authority to offer premium assistance under the Medicaid HIPP program, a section 1115 demonstration waiver, or any other authority in effect prior to the enactment of this Act. States would be required to inform parents about the availability of premium assistance subsidies for CHIP eligible children in qualified employer-sponsored insurance, how the family would elect such subsides during the application process and ensure that parents are fully informed  of the choices for receiving child health assistance under the CHIP or through the receipt of a premium assistance subsidy.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also allow States to provide premium assistance subsidies for enrollment of targeted low-income children in coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer if it is determined that such coverage is actuarially equivalent to CHIP benchmark benefits coverage, or CHIP benchmark-equivalent coverage. Plans that meet the CHIP benefit coverage requirements would not be required to provide supplemental coverage for benefits and cost-sharing  protections as required under CHIP. Such provisions would be applied to Medicaid-eligible children and to the parents of Medicaid-eligible children in the same manner as they are applied to CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, the provision would require the General Accountability Office to submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress on cost and coverage issues relating to any State premium assistance programs for which federal matching payments are made under Medicaid, CHIP, or the Section 1115 waiver authority. Such report will be due to Congress no later than January 1, 2009.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>SCHIP states plans are required to include a description of the procedures in place to provide outreach to children eligible for SCHIP child health assistance, or other public or private health programs to (1) inform these families of the availability of SCHIP coverage, and (2) to assist them in enrolling such children in SCHIP. In addition, states are required to provide a description of the state's efforts to ensure coordination between SCHIP and other public and private health coverage.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is a limit on federal spending for SCHIP administrative expenses, which include activities such as data collection and  reporting, as well as outreach and education. For federal matching purposes, a 10% cap applies to state administrative expenses. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state draws down from its annual allotment to cover benefits under SCHIP, as opposed to 10% of a state's total annual allotment. In other words, no more than  10% of the federal funds that a state draws down for SCHIP benefit expenditures can be used for administrative expenses.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require states to include a description of the procedures in place to provide outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for families of children likely to be eligible for premium assistance subsidies under CHIP or a waiver approved under Section 1115. For employers likely to provide qualified employer-sponsored coverage, the state is required to include the specific resources the State intends to apply to educate employers about the availability of premium assistance  subsidies under the CHIP state plan. Expenditures for such outreach activities would not be subject to the 10 percent limit on spending for administrative costs associated with the CHIP program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Subtitle B--Coordinating Premium Assistance With Private Coverage</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under the Internal Revenue Code, a group health plan is required to provide special enrollment opportunities to qualified individuals. Special enrollment refers to the opportunity given to qualified individuals to enroll in a health plan without having to wait until a late enrollment opportunity or open season. Such individuals must have lost eligibility for other group coverage, or lost employer contributions towards health coverage, or added a dependent due to marriage, birth, adoption, or  placement for adoption. In addition, the individual must meet the health plan's substantive eligibility requirements, such as being a full-time worker or satisfying a waiting period. Health plans must give qualified individuals at least 30 days after the qualifying event (e.g., loss of eligibility) to make a request for special enrollment.</narrative>
  <narrative>The same special enrollment opportunities apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifies the persons who may bring civil action to enforce the provisions under this statute. Such persons include a plan participant or beneficiary, a fiduciary, the Secretary of Labor, and a State. Current law allows the Secretary to assess a maximum financial penalty.against a plan administrator or employer for certain violations, including failure to meet the existing notice requirement.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require (under the Internal Revenue Code) a group health plan to permit an eligible but not enrolled employee (or dependent(s) of such an employee) to enroll for coverage under the group health plan if either of the following conditions are met: (1) the employee or dependent(s) is/are covered under Medicaid or CHIP, and coverage of the employee or dependent(s) is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan not  later than 60 days after the date of coverage termination, or (2) the employee or dependent(s) becomes eligible for assistance, with respect to coverage under the group health plan under Medicaid or CHIP (including under any waiver or demonstration project), if the employee requests coverage under the group health plan no later than 60 days after the date the employee or dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Each employer that maintains a group health plan in a State that provides premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP would be required to provide each employee a written notice of the potential opportunities for premium assistance available in the State under Medicaid and CHIP. For compliance purposes, the employer may use any State-specific model notice issued by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Health and Human Services in accordance with the model notice requirements established under  this section of the bill.</narrative>
  <narrative>The plan administer of the group health plan would be required to disclose to the State, upon request, information about the benefits available under the group health plan so as to permit the State to make a determination concerning cost-effectiveness, and in order for the State to provide supplemental benefits if required.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision includes conforming amendments. A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance (under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act) would be required to permit an eligible but not enrolled employee (or dependent(s) of such an employee) to enroll for coverage under the group health plan if either of the following conditions are met: (1) the employee or dependent(s) is/are covered under Medicaid or CHIP, and coverage of the employee or dependent(s)  is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days after the date of coverage termination, or (2) the employee or dependent(s) becomes eligible for assistance, with respect to coverage under</narrative>
  <narrative>Each employer that maintains a group health plan in a State that provides premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP would be required to provide each employee a written notice of the potential opportunities for premium assistance available in the State under Medicaid and CHIP. Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation with State Medicaid Directors and State CHIP Directors, would be required to  develop model notices to enable employers to comply with notice requirements in a timely manner. Model notices would include information regarding how an employee would contact the State for information regarding premium assistance and how to apply for such assistance.</narrative>
  <narrative>The plan administer of the group health plan would be required to disclose to the State, upon request, information about the benefits available under the group health plan so as to permit the State to make a determination concerning cost-effectiveness, and in order for the State to provide supplemental benefits if required.</narrative>
  <narrative>The HHS Secretary and the Labor Secretary would be required to jointly establish a Medicaid, CHIP, and Employer-Sponsored Coverage Coordination Working Group not later than 60 days after the date of enactment. The purpose of the Working Group would be to develop the model coverage coordination disclosure form, and to identify the impediments to effective coordination of coverage available to families. The purpose of the disclosure form would be to allow the State to determine the availability  and cost-effectiveness of coverage, and allow for coordination of coverage for enrollees of such plans. The forms will include (1) information that will allow for the determination of an employee's eligibility for coverage under the group health plan, (2) the name and contact information of the plan administrator of the group health plan, (3) benefits offered under the plan, (4) premiums and cost-sharing under the plan, and (5) any other information relevant to coverage under the plan.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Working Group would consist of no more than 30 members and be composed of representatives from the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, State directors of Medicaid and CHIP programs, employers (including owners of small businesses and their trade or industry representatives and certified human resource and payroll professionals), plan administrations and plan sponsors of group health plans, and children and other beneficiaries of Medicaid and CHIP. Members would  be required to serve without compensation. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor would be required to jointly provide appropriate administrative support to the Working Group, including technical assistance. The Working Group would be required to submit the model coverage coordination disclosure form, along with a report containing recommendations for appropriate measures to address impediments to effective coordination</narrative>
  <narrative>The Labor Secretary and the HHS Secretary would be required to develop the initial model notices, and the Labor Secretary would provide such notices to employers no later than 1 year after the date of enactment. Each employer would be required to provide initial annual notices to its employees beginning the first year after the date on which the model notices are first issued. The model coverage coordination disclosure form would also apply to requests made by States beginning the first year  after the date on which the model notices are first issued.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would amend current law by allowing the Labor Secretary to assess a civil penalty (up to $100 a day) against an employer for failure to meet the new notice requirement established under this section of the bill. Each violation with respect to any employee would be treated as a separate violation. The Labor Secretary would also be allowed to assess a civil penalty (up to $100 a day) against a plan administrator for failure to comply with the new disclosure requirement established  under this section of the bill. Each violation with respect to any participant or beneficiary would be treated as a separate violation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title V--Strengthening Quality of Care and Health Outcomes of Children</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) are both actively involved in funding and implementing an array of quality improvement initiatives, though only AHRQ has engaged in activities specific to children.</narrative>
  <narrative>In November 2002, CMS started the Quality Initiative (QI), a multi-faceted effort to improve health care quality. This program includes the Nursing Home Quality Initiative, the Home Health Quality Initiative, the National Voluntary Hospital Quality Reporting Initiative, and the Physician Focused Quality Initiative. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) included provisions for hospitals to report data on quality indicators. In addition, the MMA included  a variety of provisions designed to promote quality care, such as demonstrations that focus on improving the treatment of chronic illnesses and on identifying effective approaches for rewarding superlative performance. In 2005, quality reporting was expanded for inpatient hospital services and extended to home health. The development of plans for value-based purchasing in hospitals and home health</narrative>
  <narrative>None of the CMS QI programs to date have focused on children. Rather, most have focused on the general population, adults with chronic conditions, or the frail elderly.</narrative>
  <narrative>AHRQ has made quality improvement for children a priority in recent years. In part, this is because of the high costs incurred by children on Medicaid/SCHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Many AHRQ projects to implement and evaluate improved health care strategies for the care of children are underway. These include:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Pediatric Quality Indicators that includes a set of measures that can be used with hospital inpatient discharge data to detect patient safety events and potentially avoidable hospitalizations.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) program is a public-private initiative to develop standardized surveys of patients' experiences with ambulatory and facility-level care. Medicaid uses CAHPS to measure quality of care for children with special health care needs.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. AHRQ's Child Health Care Quality Toolbox lists tips and tools for evaluating health care quality for children. It is available to providers and consumers at www.ahrq.gov/chtoolbx/index.htm.</narrative>
  <narrative>Other AHRQ-supported initiatives to improve the quality and safety of health care for children and adolescents, focusing on health care IT, and the development of pediatric electronic medical records, among other quality improvement activities.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Development of Child Health Quality Measures For Children Enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would add a new section to the Social Security Act defining child health quality improvement activities for children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. Not later than January 1, 2009, the Secretary would be required to identify and publish for general comment an initial recommended core set of child health quality measures for use by states with respect to Medicaid and CHIP, health insurance issuers and managed care entities that enter into contracts under Medicaid and CHIP, and providers  under those two programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>With consultation with specific groups (identified below), the Secretary must identify existing quality of care measures for children that are in use under public and privately sponsored health care coverage arrangements, or that are part of reporting systems that measure both the presence and duration of health insurance coverage over time. Based on such measures, the Secretary published an initial core set of child health quality measures that includes, but is not limited to, the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>Not later than 2 years after the enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, the Secretary, in consultation with the states, must develop a standardized format for reporting information and procedures and approaches that encourage states to use the initial core measurement set to voluntarily report information regarding quality of pediatric care under Medicaid and CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the Secretary must disseminate information to states regarding best practices with respect to measuring and reporting quality of care for children, and must facilitate adoption of such best practices. In developing these best practices approaches, the Secretary must give particular attention to state measurement techniques that ensure timeliness and accuracy of provider reporting, encourage provider reporting compliance and encourage successful quality improvement strategies, and  improve efficiency in data collection using health information technology.</narrative>
  <narrative>Not later than January 1, 2010, and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary must report to Congress on (1) the status of the Secretary's efforts to improve quality related to the duration and stability of health insurance coverage for children under Medicaid and CHIP, (2) the quality of children's health care under those programs, including preventive health services, health care for acute conditions, chronic health care, and health services to ameliorate the effects of physical and mental conditions,  as well as to</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision defines "core set" to mean a group of valid, reliable and evidence-based quality measures for children that provide information regarding the quality of health coverage and health care for children, address the needs of children throughout the developmental age span, and that allow purchasers, families, and health care providers to understand the quality of care in relation to the preventive needs of children, treatments aimed at managing and resolving acute conditions, and diagnostic  and treatment services to correct or ameliorate physical, mental or developmental conditions that could become chronic if left untreated or poorly treated.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Advancing and Improving Pediatric Quality Measures.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also require the Secretary to establish a pediatric quality measures program not later than January 1, 2010. The purpose of this program would be to (1) improve and strengthen the initial core child health care quality measures, (2) expand on existing pediatric quality measures used by both public and private purchasers and advance the development of new and emerging measures, and (3) increase the portfolio of evidence-based, consensus pediatric quality measures available  to public and private purchases of children's health care services, providers and consumers.</narrative>
  <narrative>At a minimum, the pediatric quality measures developed under this program must be (1) evidence-based and where appropriate, risk-adjusted, (2) designed to identify and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in child health and the provision of health care, (3) designed to ensure that the data required for such measures is collected and reported in a standard format that permits comparisons at the state, plan and provider level, (4) periodically adjusted, and (5) responsive to child health needs,  services and stability of coverage.</narrative>
  <narrative>In identifying gaps in existing pediatric quality measures and establishing priorities for the development and use of such measures, the Secretary must consult with a variety of entities, including (1) states, (2) institutional and non-institutional providers that specialize in the care and treatment of children, particularly those with special needs, (3) dental professionals, including pediatric dental professionals, (4) primary care providers for children and families living in medically under-served  areas, or who are members of population subgroups at heightened risk for poor health outcomes, (5) national organizations representing consumers and purchasers of children's health care, (6) national organizations and individuals with expertise in pediatric health quality measurement, and (7) voluntary consensus standard setting organizations and other organizations involved in the advancement of evidence-based measures of health care.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the Secretary must award grants and contracts for the development, testing, and validation of new, emerging, and innovative evidence-based measures for children's health care services across the domains of quality identified above, and must also award grants and contracts for the (1) development of consensus on evidence-based measures for children's health care services, (2) dissemination of such measures to public and private purchasers of health care for children, and (3) updating  of such measures as necessary.</narrative>
  <narrative>Beginning no later than January 1, 2012 and annually thereafter, the Secretary must publish recommended changes to the core measures described above that must reflect the testing, validation, and consensus process for the development of pediatric quality measures also described above.</narrative>
  <narrative>The term "pediatric quality measure" means a measurement of clinical care that is capable of being examined through the collection and analysis of relevant information, that is developed in order to assess one or  more aspects of pediatric health care quality in various institutional and ambulatory health care settings, including the structure of the clinical care system, the process of care, the outcome of care, or patient experiences in care.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) Annual State Reports Regarding State-Specific Quality of Care Measures Applied Under Medicaid or CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Each state with an approved state plan for Medicaid or CHIP must report annually to the Secretary the following: (1) state-specific child health quality measures, including measures of duration and stability of insurance coverage; quality with respect to preventive services and care for acute and chronic conditions as well as services to ameliorate the effects of physical and mental conditions, and to aid in growth and development; clinical quality, health care safety, family experience with  health care, care delivered in the most integrated setting, and elimination of racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care; and other measures in the initial core quality measurement set identified above, and (2) state-specific information on the quality of care provided to children under Medicaid and CHIP, including information collected through</narrative>
  <narrative>(d) Demonstration Projects for Improving the Quality of Children's Health Care and the Use of Health Information Technology.</narrative>
  <narrative>During FY2008 through FY2012, the Secretary must award not more than 10 grants to states and child health providers to conduct demonstration projects to evaluate promising ideas for improving the quality of children's health care furnished under Medicaid and CHIP. Such projects would include efforts designed to: (1) experiment with and evaluate new measures of the quality of children's health care (including testing the validity and suitability for reporting of such measures), (2) promote the  use of health information technology in care delivery for children, (3) evaluate provider-based models that improve the delivery of services to children, including care management for children with chronic conditions and the use of evidence-based approaches to improve the effectiveness, safety</narrative>
  <narrative>In awarding these grants, the Secretary must ensure that (1) only one demonstration project funded by such a grant shall be conducted in a state, and (2) such demonstration projects must be conducted evenly between states with large urban areas and states with large rural areas. Grants may be conducted on a multi-state basis, as needed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Of the total amount appropriated for this new grant program for a fiscal year (described below), $20 million must be used to carry out these activities.</narrative>
  <narrative>(e) Demonstration Projects for Reducing Childhood Obesity</narrative>
  <narrative> Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Greater awareness of the obesity crisis and its long-term social and economic implications has encouraged policy makers to fund an array of programs aimed at promoting physical activity and appropriate nutrition. While many of these have been state-based efforts, the federal government has actively funded obesity research as well as health promotion campaigns and public health surveillance systems.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC) obliges the Secretary of Health and Human Services to "conduct . . . encourage, cooperate with, and render assistance to other appropriate public authorities, scientific institutions, and scientists in the conduct of, and promote the coordination of, research, investigations, experiments, and demonstrations, and studies relating to the causes, diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of physical and mental diseases and impairments". In  carrying out these responsibilities, the Secretary is authorized to make grants-in-aid to universities, hospitals, laboratories, other public or private institutions, and to individuals for research projects.</narrative>
  <narrative>The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recently noted that the fundamental problem plaguing national programs seeking to address the obesity crisis is that these efforts "remain fragmented and small-scale". Moreover, obesity prevention programs remain largely uncoordinated. Although many federal agencies are involved in  overseeing different types of obesity-related programs, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, and Department of Health and Human Services, NAS concluded that the lack of a dedicated funding stream for obesity prevention and inadequate coordination between federal agencies has led to inefficient uses of resources or unnecessary redundancies in programmatic efforts.</narrative>
  <narrative>Another problem is that many federal funding streams available to support healthy lifestyles among children have been very narrowly focused on small target populations or they have only addressed obesity indirectly. Examples of the former include efforts which have exclusively targeted low-income families (usually, Medicaid recipients); by contrast, health education courses aimed at American Indians with Type 2 diabetes exemplify the types of federally-funded efforts which have indirectly served  as obesity prevention programs but which have reached very limited numbers of individuals in the aggregate.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare a Medicaid Services, shall conduct a demonstration project to develop a comprehensive and systematic model for reducing childhood obesity by awarding grants to eligible entities to carry out such a project. The model will (1) identify behavioral risk factors for obesity among children; (2) identify needed clinical preventive and screening benefits among those children identified as target individuals on the basis  of such risk factors; (3) provide ongoing support to such target individuals and their families to reduce risk factors and promote the appropriate use of preventive and screening benefits; and (4) be designed to improve health outcomes, satisfaction, quality of life, and appropriate use of items and services for which medical assistance is available under CHIP and Medicaid.</narrative>
  <narrative>Eligible entities include a city, county, or Indian tribe; a local or tribal educational agency; an accredited university, college, or community college; a federally-qualified health center; a local health department; a health care provider; a community-based organization; or any other entity determined appropriate by the Secretary, including a consortium or partnership.</narrative>
  <narrative>An eligible entity awarded a grant under this provision shall use the funds to (1) carry out community-based activities related to reducing childhood obesity, (2) carry out age-appropriate school-based activities that are designed to reduce childhood obesity, (3) carry out educational, counseling, promotional, and training activities through the local health care delivery systems, and (4) provide, through qualified health professionals, training and supervision for community health workers to  engage in educational efforts related to obesity.</narrative>
  <narrative>Not later than 3 years after the Secretary implements the demonstration project under this subsection, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes the project, evaluates the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the project, evaluates beneficiary satisfaction under the project, and includes any other information the Secretary deems appropriate. $25 million is authorized for this purpose.</narrative>
  <narrative>(f) Development of Model Electronic Health Record Format for Children Enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Not later than January 1, 2009, the Secretary must establish a program to encourage the development and dissemination of a model electronic health record format for children enrolled under state plans for Medicaid or CHIP. Such an electronic health record would be (1) subject to state laws, accessible to parents, caregivers and other consumers for the sole purpose of demonstrating compliance with school or leisure activity requirements, (2) designed to allow interoperable exchanges that conform  with federal and state privacy and security requirements, (3) structured in a manner that permits parents and caregivers to view and understand the extent to which the care their children receive is clinically appropriate and of high quality, and (4) capable</narrative>
  <narrative>(g) Study of Pediatric Health and Health Care Quality Measures.</narrative>
  <narrative>Not later than July 1, 2009, the Institute of Medicine must study and report to Congress on the extent and quality of efforts to measure child health status and the quality of health care for children across the age span and in relation to preventive care, treatments for acute conditions, and treatments to ameliorate or correct physical, mental, and developmental conditions in children. In conducting this study, the IOM must: (1) consider all the major national population-based reporting systems  sponsored by the federal government, including reporting requirements under federal grant programs and national population surveys and estimates conducted directly by the federal government, (2) identify the information regarding child health and health care quality that each system is designed to capture and generate, the study and reporting periods covered by each system, and the extent to which the information is made widely available through publication, (3) identify gaps in knowledge related to children's health status, health disparities among subgroups of children, the effects of social conditions</narrative>
  <narrative>(h) Rule of Construction.</narrative>
  <narrative>No evidence-based quality measure developed, published, or used as a basis of measurement or reporting under this section may be used to establish an irrebuttable presumption regarding either the medical necessity of care or the maximum permissible coverage for any individual child who is eligible for and receiving assistance under Medicaid or CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>(i) Appropriations.</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $45 million for FY2008 through FY2012 would be made for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section. Such funds would remain available until expended.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also use the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) applicable to a given state to determine the federal share of costs incurred by states for the development or modification of existing claims processing and retrieval systems as is necessary for the efficient collection and reporting on child health measures.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under SCHIP, states must assess the operation of the SCHIP state plan in each fiscal Year, including the progress made in reducing the number of uncovered low-income children. They must also report to the Secretary of HHS, by January 1 following the end of the fiscal year, the results of that assessment.</narrative>
  <narrative>Federal regulations stipulate that each annual report include the following additional information: (1) progress in meeting strategic objectives and performance goals identified in the state SCHIP plan, (2) effectiveness of policies to discourage the institution of public coverage for private coverage, (3) identification of successes and barriers in state plan design and implementation, and the approaches the state is considering to overcome these barriers, (4) progress in addressing any specific  issues (such as outreach) that the state plan proposed to periodically monitor and assess, (5) an updated 3-year budget, including any changes in the sources of non-federal share of state pan expenditures, (6) identification of total state expenditures for family coverage and</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Inclusion of Process and Access Measures in Annual State Reports.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require each state to include the following information in its annual CHIP report to the Secretary of HHS: (1) eligibility criteria, enrollment, and retention data (including information on continuity of coverage or duration of benefits), (2) data regarding the extent to which the state uses process measures with respect to determining the eligibility of children, including measures such as 12-months of continuous eligibility, self-declaration of income for applications or  renewals, or presumptive eligibility, (3) data regarding denials of eligibility and redeterminations of eligibility, (4) data regarding access to primary and specialty services, access to networks of care, and care coordination provided under the state CHIP plan, using quality of care and consumer satisfaction measures included in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey, (5) if the state provides child health assistance in the form of premium assistance for the purchase of coverage under a group health plan, data regarding the provision of such assistance, including the extent to which employer-sponsored health insurance coverage is available for children eligible for CHIP, the range of the monthly amount of such assistance provided on behalf or a child or family, the number of children or families provided</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) GAG Study and Report on Access to Primary and Specialty Services.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require GAO to conduct a study of children's access to primary and specialty services under Medicaid and CHIP, including (1) the extent to which providers are willing to treat children eligible for such programs, (2) information on such children's access to networks of care, (3) geographic availability of primary and specialty services under such programs, (4) the extent to which care coordination is provided for children's care under Medicaid and CHIP, and (5) as appropriate,  information on the degree of availability of services for children under such programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, GAO must submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress on this study that includes recommendations for such federal and state legislative and administrative changes as GAO determines are necessary to address any barriers to access to children's care under Medicaid and CHIP that may exist.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>A number of sections of the Social Security Act apply to states under title XXI (SCHIP) in the same manner as they apply to a state under title XIX (Medicaid). These include:</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 1902(a)(4)(C) (relating to conflict of interest standards).</narrative>
  <narrative>Paragraphs (2), (16), and (17) of section 1903(i) (relating to limitations on payment).</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 1903(w) (relating to limitations on provider taxes and donations).</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 1920A (relating to presumptive eligibility for children).</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would add the same requirements for CHIP managed care entities as currently exist under Medicaid. Specifically, the provision would add reference to Medicaid's statutory requirements on: the process for plan enrollment, termination, and change of enrollment; the type of information provided to enrollees and potential enrollees on providers, covered services, enrollee rights, and other forms of information; beneficiary protections; quality assurance standards; protections against  fraud and abuse; and sanctions against managed care plans for noncompliance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title VI--Miscellaneous</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>States may provide SCHIP through an expansion of their Medicaid programs. Expenditures for such populations of targeted low-income children are matched at the enhanced FMAP rate and are paid out of SCHIP allotments.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>With respect to expenditures for Medicaid for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 only, a state may elect (1) to cover optional poverty-related children and, may apply less restrictive income methodologies to such individuals (via authority in Section 1902(r) or through Section 1931 (b )(2)( C)), for which the regular Medicaid FMAP, rather than the enhanced FMAP applicable to CHIP, would be used to determine the federal share of such expenditures, or (2) to receive the regular Medicaid FMAP, rather than  the enhanced CHIP FMAP, for CHIP children under an expansion of the state's Medicaid program. This provision would be repealed as of October 1, 2008 (i.e., the beginning of fiscal year 2009). States electing these options would be "held harmless" for related expenditures in FY2007 and FY2008, once this repeal takes effect.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>P.L. 107-300 requires the heads of Federal agencies annually to review programs they oversee that are susceptible to significant erroneous payments, and to estimate the amount of improper payments, to report those estimates to Congress, and to submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous expenditures.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency within HHS that administers the Medicaid and SCHIP programs, issued an interim final rule with comment period on August 28, 2006, regarding Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) for the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. This rule was effective on October 1, 2006. In addition to P.L. 107-300, this regulation points to Sections 1102, 1902(a)(6) and 2107(b)(1) of the Social Security Act which contains the Secretary's general rulemaking  authority and obligation of the states to provide information, as the Secretary may require, to monitor program performance. Section 1902(a)(27)(B) also requires states to require providers to furnish State Medicaid Agencies and the Secretary with information regarding payments claimed by Medicaid providers for furnishing Medicaid services. Payment error rates will be calculated for fee-for-service (FFS) claims, managed care claims and for eligibility determinations. The preamble</narrative>
  <narrative>With respect to Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility reviews under PERM, states selected for review in a given year must conduct reviews of a statistically valid random sample of beneficiary claims to determine if improper payments were made based on errors in the state agency's eligibility determinations. States must have a CMS-approved sampling plan. In addition to reporting error  rates, states must also submit a corrective action plan based on its error  rate analysis, and must return overpayments of federal funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) is operated by State Medicaid agencies to monitor and improve the administration of its Medicaid program. The traditional MEQC program is based on State reviews of Medicaid beneficiaries identified through a statistically reliable statewide sample of cases selected from the eligibility files. These reviews are conducted to determine whether the sampled cases meet applicable Title XIX eligibility requirements and to determine if a State has made erroneous  excess payments in its program. "Erroneous excess payments for medical assistance" reflect: a) payments made on behalf of ineligible individuals and families, and b) overpayments on behalf of eligible individuals and families by reason of error in determining the amount of expenditures for medical care required of an individual or family as a condition of eligibility.</narrative>
  <narrative>The SCHIP statute specifies that federal SCHIP funds can be used for SCHIP health insurance coverage, called child health assistance that meets certain requirements. States may also provide benefits to SCHIP children, called targeted low-income children, through enrollment in Medicaid. Apart from these benefit payments, SCHIP payments for four other specific health care activities can be made, including: (1) other child health assistance for targeted low-income children; (2) health services initiatives  to improve the health of targeted low-income children and other low-income children; (3) outreach activities; and (4) other reasonable administrative costs. For a given fiscal year, SCHIP statute specifies that payments for these four other specific health care activities cannot exceed 10% of the total amount of expenditures for benefits (excluding payments for services rendered during periods of presumptive eligibility under Medicaid) and other specific health care activities combined.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would apply a federal matching rate of 90 percent to expenditures related to administration of PERM requirements applicable to CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also exclude from the 10% cap on CHIP administrative costs all expenditures related to the administration of PERM requirements applicable to CHIP in accordance with P.L. 107-300, existing regulations, and any related or successor guidance or regulations.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the Secretary must not calculate or publish any national or state-specific error rate based on the application of PERM requirements to CHIP until after the date that is 6 months after the date on which a final rule implementing such requirements (described below) is in effect for all states. Any calculation of a national error rate or a state specific error rate after such a final rule is in effect for all states may only be inclusive of errors, as defined in such final rule or in  guidance issued within a reasonable time frame after the effective date for such final rule that includes detailed guidance for the specific methodology for error determinations.</narrative>
  <narrative>The final rule implementing the PERM requirements must include: (1) clearly defined criteria for errors for both states and providers, (2) a clearly defined process for appealing error determinations by review contractors, and (3) clearly defined responsibilities and deadlines for states in implementing any corrective action plans.</narrative>
  <narrative>After the final PERM rule is in effect for all states, a state for which the PERM requirements were first in effect under an interim final rule for FY2007 may elect to accept any payment error rate determined in whole or in part for the state on the basis of data for that fiscal year or may elect to not have an payment error rate determined on the basis of such data and, instead, must be treated as if FY2010 were the first year for which the PERM requirements apply to the state.</narrative>
  <narrative>If the final PERM rule is not in effect for all states by July 1, 2008, a state for which the PERM requirements were first in effect under an interim final rule for FY2008 may elect to accept any payment error rate determined in whole or in part for the state on the basis of data for that fiscal year, or may elect to not have any payment error rate determined on the basis of such data and, instead, must be treated as if FY2011 were the first fiscal year for which the PERM requirements apply to  the state.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the provision would require the Secretary to review the Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) requirements with the PERM requirements and coordinate consistent implementation of both sets of requirements, while reducing redundancies. A state may elect, for purposes of determining the erroneous excess payments for medical assistance ratio applicable to the state under MEQC, to substitute data resulting from the application of PERM requirements after the final PERM rule is in  effect for all states for the data used for the MEQC requirements.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary must also establish state-specific sample sizes for application of the PERM requirements with respect to CHIP for FY2009 and thereafter, on the basis of information as the Secretary determines is appropriate. In establishing such sample sizes, the Secretary must, to the greatest extent possible (1) minimize the administrative cost burden on states under Medicaid and CHIP, and (2) maintain state flexibility to manage these programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules, states are allowed to temporarily enroll (for up to 2 months) children whose family income appears to be below applicable Medicaid income standards, until a formal determination of eligibility is made. Payments on behalf of Medicaid children during periods of presumptive eligibility are matched at the regular Medicaid FMAP, but are paid out of state SCHIP allotments.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would strike the language in existing CHIP statute that sets the federal share of costs incurred during periods of presumptive eligibility for children at the Medicaid FMAP rate, and also strikes the language that allows payment out of CHIP allotments for Medicaid benefits received by Medicaid children during periods of presumptive eligibility.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>As discussed in Section 102, the percentage of the SCHIP appropriation that is allotted to individual states is based primarily on state-level estimates of (1) the number of low-income children and (2) the number of uninsured low-income children, based on a three-year average of the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplements (formerly known as the March supplements) to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). Based on these CPS estimates, some states' share of the available national  allotment in the second year of SCHIP (FY1999) was going to differ markedly from the prior year's (e.g., a share of the available national allotment in FY1999 that would have been approximately 40% lower or higher than in FY1998). As a result, legislation was enacted to base the FY1999 SCHIP allotments on the states' share of the available national allotment as calculated for FY1998.</narrative>
  <narrative>Separate legislation was also enacted to add two new floors and a ceiling to ensure that a state's share of the available national allotment did not change by more than certain amounts, as compared to the state's prior-year share and the state's FY1998/FY1999 share.</narrative>
  <narrative>Another piece of legislation was also enacted that required appropriate adjustments to the CPS (1) to produce statistically reliable annual state data on the number of low-income children who do not have health insurance coverage, so that real changes in the uninsurance rates of children can reasonably be detected; (2) to produce data that categorizes such children by family income, age, and race or ethnicity; and (3) where appropriate, to expand the sample size used in the state sampling units,  to expand the number of sampling units in a state, and to include an appropriate verification element. For this purpose, $10 million was appropriated annually, beginning in FY2000. Because of this legislation, the number of sampled households in the ASEC CPS increased by about</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>Besides the $10 million provided annually for the CPS since FY2000, an additional $10 million (for a total of $20 million additionally) is appropriated. In addition to the current-law requirements of the additional appropriation, for data collection beginning in FY2008, in appropriate consultation with the HHS Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce shall do the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>Make appropriate adjustments to the CPS to develop more accurate state-specific estimates of the number of children enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid;</narrative>
  <narrative>Make appropriate adjustments to the CPS to improve the survey estimates used to compile the state-specific and national number of low-income children without health insurance for purposes of determining annual CHIP allotments, and for making payments to states from the CHIP Incentive Pool, the CHIP Contingency Fund, and, to the extent applicable to a State, from the block grant set aside for CHIP payments on behalf of parents in FY2010 through FY2012;</narrative>
  <narrative>Include health insurance survey information in the American Community Survey (ACS) related to children;</narrative>
  <narrative>Assess whether ACS estimates, once such survey data are first available, produce more reliable estimates than the CPS for CHIP allotments and payments;</narrative>
  <narrative>On the basis of that assessment, recommend to the HHS Secretary whether ACS estimates should be used in lieu of, or in some combination with, CPS estimates for CHIP purposes; and</narrative>
  <narrative>Continue making the adjustments to expansion of the sample size used in State sampling units, the number of sampling units in a State, and using an appropriate verification element.</narrative>
  <narrative>If the Commerce Secretary recommends to the HHS Secretary that ACS estimates should be used instead of, or in combination with, CPS estimates for CHIP purposes, the HHS Secretary may provide a transition period for using ACS estimates, provided that  the transition is implemented in a way that avoids adverse impacts on states.</narrative>
  <narrative>State Flexibility in Benefit Packages.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under the Early and Periodic, Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit under Medicaid, most children under age 21 receive comprehensive basic screening services (i.e., well-child visits including age-appropriate immunizations) as well as dental, vision and hearing services. In addition, EPSDT guarantees access to all federally coverable services necessary to treat a problem or condition among eligible individuals.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under Medicaid, categorically needy (CN) eligibility groups include families with children, the elderly, certain individuals with disabilities, and certain other pregnant women and children who meet applicable financial eligibility standards. Some CN eligibility groups must be covered while others are optional. Medically needy (MN) groups include the same types of individuals, but different, typically higher financial standards apply. All MN eligibility groups are optional.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171) gave states the option to provide Medicaid to state-specified groups through enrollment in benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage which is nearly identical to plans available under SCHIP (described above). For any child under age 19 in one of the major mandatory and optional CN eligibility groups (defined in Section 1902(a)(10)(A)), wrap-around benefits to the DRA benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage includes EPSDT (described above).  In traditional Medicaid, EPSDT is available to individuals under age 21 in CN groups, and may be offered to individuals under 21 in MN groups.</narrative>
  <narrative>DRA identifies a number of groups as exempt from mandatory enrollment in benchmark or benchmark equivalent plans. One such exempted group is children in foster care receiving child welfare services under Part B of title IV of the Social Security Act and children receiving foster care or adoption assistance under Part E of such title.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would require that EPSDT be covered for any individual under age 21 who is eligible for Medicaid through the state plan under one of the major mandatory and optional CN groups and is enrolled in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans authorized under DRA. The provision would also give states flexibility in providing coverage of EPSDT services through the issuer of benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage or otherwise.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would also make a correction to the reference to children in foster care receiving child welfare services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, not later than 30 days after the date the Secretary approves a state plan amendment to provide benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage under Medicaid, the Secretary must publish in the Federal Register and on the internet website of CMS, a list of the provisions in Title XIX that the Secretary has determined do not apply in order to enable the state to carry out such a state plan amendment and the reason for each such determination.</narrative>
  <narrative>The amendments made by this provision would become effective as if included in Section 6044(a) of the DRA (i.e., March 31, 2006).</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>P.L. 106-113 directed the Secretary of HHS or any other Federal officer or employee, with respect to references to the program under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, in any publication or official communication to use the term "SCHIP" instead of "CHIP" and to use the term "State children's health insurance program" instead of "children's health insurance program."</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would repeal the section in P.L 106-113 providing the program references to "SCHIP" and "State children's health insurance program" for official publication and communication purposes.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>In 1996, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) that established new federal standards for mental health coverage offered by group health plans, most of which are employment-based. Under provisions included in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33), Medicaid managed care plans and SCHIP programs must comply with the requirements of MHPA.</narrative>
  <narrative>Medicaid expansions under SCHIP follow Medicaid rules. Thus, when such expansions provide for enrollment in Medicaid managed care plans, the MHPA applies. Separate state programs under SCHIP follow SCHIP rules that have broader application than the Medicaid rules. In separate state SCHIP programs, to the extent that a health insurance issuer offers group health insurance coverage, which can include, but is not limited to managed care, the MHPA applies.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under MHPA, Medicaid and SCHIP plans may define what constitutes mental health benefits (if any). The MHPA prohibits group plans from imposing annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage that are more restrictive than those applicable to medical and surgical coverage. Full parity is not required, that is, group plans may still impose more restrictive treatment limits (e.g., with respect to total number of outpatient visits or inpatient days) or cost-sharing requirements on mental  health coverage compared to their medical and surgical services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under Medicaid managed care, state Medicaid agencies contract with managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide a specified set of benefits to enrolled beneficiaries. These MCOs may be paid under a variety of arrangements, but are frequently reimbursed on the basis of a pre-determined monthly fee (called a capitation rate) for each enrolled beneficiary. The contracted benefits may include all, some, or none of the mandatory and optional mental health services covered under the state Medicaid  plan. When Medicaid managed care plans do not include all covered mental health benefits, these additional services are sometimes "carved out" to a separate, specialized behavioral health managed care entity (usually subject to its own prepaid capitation rates), or may be provided in the fee-for-service setting, in which Medicaid providers are paid directly by the state</narrative>
  <narrative>With respect to covered benefits, separate SCHIP programs tend to look more like private insurance models than like Medicaid. That is, these programs are more likely to cover traditional benefits (e.g., inpatient hospital services, physician services) that would be found in employer-based health insurance plans than certain service categories that are largely unique to Medicaid (e.g., EPSDT, residential treatment facilities, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded or ICF/MRs, and  institutions for mental disease or IMDs). Most separate SCHIP programs also provide services through managed care plans, although this situation varies by state. Again, all or some covered mental health services may be included in MCO contracts, or carved out to specialized behavioral health managed care plans, or may be provided on a fee-for-service basis.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under CHIP, states may provide coverage under their Medicaid programs (MXP), create a new separate SCHIP program (SSP), or both. Under SSPs, states may elect any of three benefit options: (1) a benchmark plan, (2) a benchmark-equivalent plan, or (3) any other plan that the Secretary of HHS deems would provide appropriate coverage for the target population (called Secretary-approved benefit plans). Benchmark plans include (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option under  FEHBP, (2) the coverage generally available to state employees, and (3) the coverage offered by the largest commercial HMO in the state.</narrative>
  <narrative>Benchmark-equivalent plans must cover basic benefits (i.e., inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, lab/x-ray, and well-child care including immunizations), and must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the selected benchmark plan for specific additional benefits (i.e., prescription drugs, mental health services, vision care and hearing services).</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>This section prohibits discriminatory limits on mental health care in separate CHIP plans by directing that any financial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to mental health or substance abuse services must be no more restrictive than the financial requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical services. It also eliminates a current law provision that authorizes states to reduce the mental health coverage provided to 75 percent of the coverage provided in CHIP benchmark  plans.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under SCHIP, states may provide coverage under their Medicaid programs (MXP), create a new separate SCHIP program (SSP), or both. Under SSPs, states may elect any of three benefit options: (1) a benchmark plan, (2) a benchmark-equivalent plan, or (3) any other plan that the Secretary of HHS deems would provide appropriate coverage for the target population (called Secretary-approved benefit plans). Benchmark plans include (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option under  FEHBP, (2) the coverage generally available to state employees, and (3) the coverage offered by the largest commercial HMO in the state.</narrative>
  <narrative>Benchmark-equivalent plans must cover basic benefits (i.e., inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, lab/x-ray, and well-child care including immunizations), and must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the selected benchmark plan for specific additional benefits (i.e., prescription drugs, mental health services, vision care and hearing services).</narrative>
  <narrative>SCHIP regulations specify that, regardless of the type of SCHIP health benefits coverage, states must provide coverage of well-baby and well-child care (as defined by the state), age-appropriate immunizations based on recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and emergency services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>This section provides up to $200 million in federal grants for states to improve the availability of dental services and strengthen dental coverage for children covered under CHIP. States that receive grants would be required to maintain prior levels of spending for dental services provided under CHIP.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law </narrative>
  <narrative>Under current Medicaid law, federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics (RHCs) are paid based on a prospective payment system. Beginning in FY200l, per visit payments were based on 100% of average costs during 1999 and 2000 adjusted for changes in the scope of services furnished. (Special rules applied to entities first established after 2000). For subsequent years, the per visit payment for all FQHCs and RHCs equals the amounts for the preceding fiscal year increased  by the percentage increase in the Medicare Economic Index applicable to primary care services, and adjusted for any changes in the scope of services furnished during that fiscal year. In managed care contracts, states are required to make supplemental payments to the facility equal to the difference between the contracted amount and the cost-based amounts.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>This section would establish a prospective payment system in CHIP for FQHCs and RHCs similar to the payment system established by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) applicable under Medicaid law. States that operate separate or combination CHIP programs would be required to reimburse FQHCs and RHCs based on the Medicaid Prospective Payment System, starting in FY 09. A one-time appropriation of $5 million will be made available to the Secretary  of HHS to be provided to affected states to enable them to transition to the new payment system on the affected states. The Secretary would be required to monitor the impact of the application of the payment system on states and report to Congress within two years of implementation on any effect on access to benefits, provider payment rates, or scope of benefits offered by affected states.</narrative>
  <narrative>Title VII--Revenue Provisions</narrative>
  <narrative>Title VIII--Effective Date</narrative>
  <narrative>Current Law</narrative>
  <narrative>No provision.</narrative>
  <narrative>Explanation of Provision </narrative>
  <narrative>The effective date of this bill except with respect to section 301 would be October 1, 2007, whether or not final regulations to carry out provisions in the bill have been promulgated by that date. In the case of both current state CHIP and Medicaid plans, if the Secretary of HHS determines that a state must pass new state legislation to implement the requirements of this bill, the state's existing CHIP and/or Medicaid plans, if applicable, would not be considered to be out of compliance solely  on the basis of its failure to meet such requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first regular session of the state legislature that begins after the date of enactment of this bill. In the case of a state that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session must be considered to be a separate regular session of the state legislature. With respect to section 301, the effective date will be October 1, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>(At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="Introducing S. 1894. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to provide family and medical leave to primary caregivers of servicemembers with combat-related injuries; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1894">S. 1894</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007. This bill will implement one of the key recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. First of all, I commend former Senator Bob Dole, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and the distinguished members of the Commission for their thoughtfulness and thorough work on this critically important matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 20 years ago, I began the effort to bring job protection to hard-working Americans so they wouldn't have to choose between the family they love and the job they need. This effort, after more than seven years, three presidents, and two vetoes, eventually led to the enactment of the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave for eligible employees to care for a newborn or adopted child, their own serious illness or that of a loved one. Since its passage, I  have worked to expand this act to cover more workers and to provide for wage replacement, so that more employees can afford to take leave when necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is essential that we do everything possible to support our troops and to allow their loved ones to be with them as they recover from a combat-related injury or illness. That is why we must expand and improve leave benefits to those caring for our injured or ill servicemembers. The bill I introduce today provides up to 6 months of FMLA leave for primary caregivers of servicemembers who suffer from a combat-related injury or illness. FMLA currently provides for 3 months of unpaid  leave to a spouse, parent or child acting as a caregiver for a person with a serious illness. However, some of those injured in service to our country rely on other family members or friends to care for them as they recover. This legislation allows these other primary caregivers, such as siblings, cousins, friends or significant others to take leave from their employment when our returning heroes need them most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops are giving their all on the battlefield. The very least our Government owes them is its total support for their family and medical needs. While FMLA has provided critical support to more than 50 million American families, I will not rest until we are able to modernize this statute to cover our wounded warriors. Plain and simple, the loved ones of these brave men and women should be allowed to care for them without the fear of losing their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that I am joined today by Senators Ben Nelson, Kennedy, Reed and Lieberman in introducing the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007 and ask for the support of all my colleagues for this critically important effort to care for our returning wounded warriors and their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record..</paragraph>
