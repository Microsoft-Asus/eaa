  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Indiana?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I need a point of clarification on the amendment here on the UC. It's my understanding that this says that no amendment to the bill will be offered except the following; but that there will be another UC later that will come forward that will allow the additional supplemental, to allow that to come into the bill at a later date. Am I correct on that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>My understanding is there would be an additional UC, a unanimous consent request, or a new rule for the supplemental report that would come up.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I don't think they want a new rule. I think they just want the understanding that there will be the provision that comes forth with the supplemental material coming into the bill. That was the understanding I thought was reached in the UC. Am I correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>My understanding is that we would agree to a UC.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't think they want a new rule. I think the point is they don't want to go back to Rules again to bring the supplemental material back into the bill at the later date, and that is basically the earmark provision of the bill. Am I correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's fine. Yes, sir.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation based on that understanding.</paragraph>
