  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 534--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF MAY 2008 AS &quot;NATIONAL DRUG COURT MONTH&quot;">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution marking May 2008 as National Drug Court Month. The more than 2,000 drug courts that currently operate across the country are critical to curbing drug use, reducing recidivism, and turning non-violent prisoners into law abiding and productive members of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drug courts closely supervise non-violent drug offenders as they address their addiction or substance abuse problem. When they graduate from the program they are clean, sober and better prepared to participate productively in society. In order to graduate from most drug court programs, participants are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, as well as maintain financial obligations including drug court fees and child support payments. A sponsor is also required to help  ensure they stay on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, I wrote the law that created the drug courts program because we believed that the programs they oversee were cost-effective, innovative alternatives to prison that would reduce crime and deal with non-violent offenders who are in desperate need of treatment. It turns out we were right. A 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office found that drug court program participants were less likely to be rearrested or reconvicted than those who did not participate in drug court programs.  The report also concluded that a conservative estimate of the net benefits to society of sending a non-violent offender throug drug court program ranges from about $1,000 per participant to about $15,000. There is just no question that these alternative to prison programs not only work, but also make great financial sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treating non-violent offenders through drug court-monitored programs and other alternatives to prison treatment programs provides them with an opportunity to turn away from drugs and to get on the path to be healthy, contributing members of society. It also helps to reduce America's exploding prison population: more than 2.3 million people are in prisons and jails across the U.S.; 1 in 100 adults in the United States are behind bars. It costs an average of nearly $24,000 to imprison an individual.  Drug courts can reduce the financial burden on State and local budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that National Drug Court Month raises awareness about the importance of drug courts and other alternatives to prison treatment-based programs. I ask my colleagues to join me in commending these programs and urging state, local and Federal officials to help expand and robustly fund these treatment programs throughout the country.</paragraph>
