  <narrative>STATEMENT ON LIBBY COMMUTATION AND PARDON FOR FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7633]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many Americans are outraged by the President's decision to commute the sentence of White House aide Scooter Libby, while at the same time, he refuses to pardon former Border Agents Ramos and Compean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scooter Libby, an attorney who understands the laws of this country and should know right from wrong, was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice, and lying to investigators. Mr. Libby, who should have served his sentence, did not spend 1 day in prison. Yet, two Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who tried their best to do their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11 and 12 years in prison today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is the agents' 176th day in Federal prison. Two heroes sit behind bars while a guilty man walks free. Again, I say, where is the justice? By attempting to apprehend a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our borders, these agents were enforcing our laws, not breaking them. For almost a year, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to pardon these agents. The President repeatedly responds that there is a pardon</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if there is a process, why did this process not matter when you commuted Mr. Libby's sentence?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has the power to immediately pardon agents Ramos and Compean, two heroes who were unjustly prosecuted for doing their job to protect our border. I have written the President and called on him to correct a true injustice by using his executive authority to immediately pardon these men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will submit for the Record the entire text of the letter that I have written to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman John Conyers, who I am sure at some point in time will hold a hearing to thoroughly review the prosecution of these agents. Tonight, I especially want to thank Senator Dianne Feinstein, who has shared my concerns about the unfairness of this prosecution. I am extremely pleased that she will be presiding over a Senate hearing next Tuesday to examine the details of this case. There are many questions and concerns about the actions of the U.S.  Attorney in this case that need to be answered. I am hopeful that justice will soon prevail for these two men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to say to the families of Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean that this House of Representatives will not forget your loved ones. We will not forget that an injustice has prevailed. We will seek justice for your husbands and your fathers and your relatives. I hope and pray that the President himself will pray about this and grant to these two men justice instead of injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the letter referred to earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 3, 2007. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In light of your recent commutation of I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby's prison sentence, I am writing to express my deep disappointment that U.S. Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean remain unjustly incarcerated for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While you have spared Mr. Libby from serving even one day of his "excessive" 30-month prison term, agents Ramos and Compean have already served 167 days of their 11- and 12-year prison sentences. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were enforcing our laws, not breaking them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is now time to listen to the American people and Members of Congress who have called upon you to pardon these agents. By granting immunity and free health care to an illegal alien drug trafficker and allowing our law enforcement officers to languish in prison--our government has told its citizens, and the world, that it does not care about protecting our borders or enforcing our laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to correct a true injustice by immediately pardoning these two law enforcement officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WALTER B. JONES, </paragraph>
  </speaking>
