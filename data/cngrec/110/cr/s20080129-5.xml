  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will have morning business for 1 hour after the two leaders make any statements they might make. As to what we do after that will take a conversation with the Republican leader, and we will do that when we finish our statements. We have a number of things that are pending: the FISA legislation, Indian health, and we have another matter I want to complete, an energy bill. We have an agreement as to how to finish that, and we will move to one of those, more than likely,  today.</paragraph>
