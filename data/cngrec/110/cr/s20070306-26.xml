    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I honor John Bass, a much loved member of the St. Louis community, who died last month at the age of 80. John Bass was soft-spoken and low-key but he was also a fighter. As a young man, he served his country in the U.S. Navy. When he returned from service, he found himself living in a racially divided, socially and economically troubled city. Determined to bring change to his community, John literally fought his way through a college education.  As a champion boxer, he won a boxing scholarship to Lincoln University. But John's true fight for St. Louis came long after he hung up his gloves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an educator in Beaumont High School, John was a calming presence in a school bitterly divided by racial tension. There, at Beaumont, and probably for the first time in his life, John was sent to the principal's office the hard way. After he began his new job as principal of Beaumont High, he provided the calm, wise leadership that was necessary to soothe wounds that years of inequality inflicted on our Nation's educational system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John was already a distinguished member of the St. Louis community when he rolled up his sleeves and delved into politics to bring positive change to the city of St. Louis by shaping its policies. He did not come from a family of politicians, and he did not inherit a political power base. He came to politics as a thoughtful, practical, and hard-working man who wanted to make his community a better place to live. With these attributes, John Bass won the trust and respect of St. Louis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John served as an alderman, State senator, and cabinet official, but is best known for becoming the first African American to win the office of comptroller in St. Louis history. When he ran for that office in 1973, the mayor told him that the prevailing racial tensions in St. Louis would prevent his election. Undeterred, John ignored that prediction, won his seat, crashed his way into the city's most important financial post, and left his mark on the city of St. Louis. Regarded highly by his  contemporaries as well as older and younger politicians, John helped pilot the city of St. Louis through some of its most turbulent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With John's passing, we have lost a prolific public servant, a trusted friend, and a quiet but powerful leader.</paragraph>
