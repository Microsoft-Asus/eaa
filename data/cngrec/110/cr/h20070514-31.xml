    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, April revenue showers. That is what the Wall Street Journal called the large government revenues received by this Federal Government in the month of April. It was $70 billion over revenue in 2006. It shows that tax cuts work. The Democrats, on the other hand, want to raise taxes. They want to raise the taxes that American people pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we believe in and what the President has done in just the five short years he has been in office is to actually cut taxes that the American people pay, which, in the end, through greater economic growth, will lead to more government revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A case in point: the capital gains tax cut and the dividends tax cut, those two things have resulted in a 30 percent increase in revenue under those two provisions. It shows that tax cuts work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are good for the economy and they are good for the American people, and we need to extend the tax cuts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
