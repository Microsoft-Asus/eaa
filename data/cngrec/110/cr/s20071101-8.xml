    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have a lot to do, there is no question about that. But I said to one of my friends on the Republican side several days ago, when he was lamenting the fact that the President's standing was low and ours in Congress was low, I said to him: What do you hope to accomplish by denigrating the place you work in? You work here. What good is it to do that? He said: That is right, I will not do it anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend from Kentucky, it is easy to find fault with what anyone does anyplace in life, including the Senate of the United States. But we have worked very hard these last 10 months to try to work on a bipartisan basis, to accomplish things for the country. We have done a pretty good job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. We passed a budget--a pay-as-you-go budget. No more red ink; we are paying for everything. That is different than the last 7 years under a Republican-controlled Congress. We passed a law mandating how U.S. attorneys should be appointed, as a result of the scandal in the Attorney General's Office. We mandated, through legislation, equipment for the Guard and Reserve that they simply didn't have. We are the ones who pushed the President  to focus on having better equipment for our troops, including MRAPS, these vehicles that were more mine resistant. We passed that and it is in the form of a law. Because of the scandal at Walter Reed and other places, we have worked to protect veterans; hurricane recovery,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the matter before the Senate today. We are going to send that back to him, and I hope he will not veto it. We have made changes because Members on the other side wanted those changes made. Disaster relief for ranchers and farmers, we passed that. It is 4 years overdue. Wildfire relief, we have had these fires sweeping the West. We put $600 million in the supplemental so we can make up for some of the problems we had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as Iraq, we have had over 100 hearings on Iraq. That is 100 more than were held during the first 5 years of this war. The hearings have been good. It is true we have tried very hard to change course in the war in Iraq, and we have changed course, indirectly, as a result of the votes we have taken. It did not change it enough, but we have changed course in the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be other opportunities for us to do that in the near future. We have to do that. The President doesn't mind asking for another $200 billion of totally red ink--that is, borrowed money--for the war. But he is not willing to spend a few nonred dollars for children's health, paid for. Maybe the President is trying to protect the tobacco industry. I think they have had  enough protection. A small increase in the tax on tobacco to pay for the children  certainly seems reasonable. Stem cell research, we passed that. On ethics and lobbying, we passed the most significant reform in the history of the country, which is now law. The 9/11 Commission recommendations, there was a lot of talk about those recommendations. They were not put into law until we did it this year. We did it because it was the right thing to do. We reauthorized FDA. We passed WRDA--which is years and years past due--by a huge bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everything I have talked about has been bipartisan, even the votes on Iraq. We could not get 60 votes, but we had bipartisan support on Iraq. We all acknowledge we can do better. Certainly, we can do better. But I don't think we should lament the fact that we have not been able to do everything everyone wants done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Attorney General nominee, Judge Mukasey, a problem has arisen with that nomination. It seems like we are in the "Twilight Zone." We are in the Senate talking about whether waterboarding is torture, and this man cannot acknowledge whether waterboarding is torture. I read this morning in the newspaper the reason he cannot do that is he is afraid if he says waterboarding is torture, it may create criminal or civil responsibilities for some of the people who did torture people through  waterboarding. We are the United States of America, and we are concerned about talking openly about torture?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I read a book a couple of years ago. The name of the book is "1492." It talked about how our world changed in 1492. One of the reasons it changed is the Inquisition. It started in 1492, the same time Columbus discovered this Nation, this world. In 1492, they also discovered waterboarding, how to torture people, mostly Jews but not all Jews. Some Christians who were not Christian enough were waterboarded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe we will work our way through Mukasey, but no one should be concerned about the fact that we have an obligation and a right to talk about torture. Shouldn't we know where the chief legal officer of this country, the Attorney General of the United States, stands on waterboarding, on torture generally?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to our having a good day today and accomplishing a lot. We don't have a lot of time left in this legislative session. We have at the most about 6 weeks, but I hope during that period of time we continue to work together for the American people. That is what the American people want.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me briefly add, it is not too late for this first session of Congress to achieve a better record. We need to get appropriations bills not just sent to the President but signed by the President. We need to get the AMT fixed so we don't inconvenience, to the tune of $75 billion, millions of American taxpayers. We need to provide bridge funding for our troops that we all know is needed. And we need to confirm an Attorney General. Our colleagues on the other  side have been saying we need a new Attorney General all year long. Now it is time to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The record of this first session of this Congress is not yet made. It is not too late, but it is getting very late, and hopefully we will accomplish a lot in the next 6 weeks, as the majority leader has indicated he would like to see done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader is absolutely correct. We have to fix AMT, and we will do that. The reason we have been a little slow in doing so is how we are going to pay for it. Being an appropriator for my years in Congress, I certainly want to do that. We have struggled over the last several years doing appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican leader and I believe appropriations bills should be done, and we have to do them this year. I am going to devote a lot of my energy--the meeting I had just before coming to the Chamber was dealing with appropriations bills. I had a good conversation with the Republican leader yesterday about appropriations bills generally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is absolutely right. We can do better. I will certainly attempt to do my share and do a better job.</paragraph>
