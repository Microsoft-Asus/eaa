  <narrative>REMARKS ON THE SCHIP VETO OVERRIDE -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11554]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the SCHIP program and urge all of my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the number of uninsured adults has steadily climbed over the past 10 years, the number of uninsured children in our Nation has declined by nearly a third. This is a direct result of the SCHIP program which began in 1997 with the goal, and indeed the national commitment, of providing health insurance for children whose parents cannot afford private health coverage. I was proud to be a part of a Congress that was able to craft a responsible and critical reauthorization of the SCHIP program,  one that would ensure that all eligible children can participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, while Democrats and Republicans here in Congress were able to put politics aside for the sake of this critical program, the President chose not to do so. His veto means that thousands of children in Rhode Island and millions more across the country will be denied access to health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto and show our support for a program that has been tremendously successful in supporting working families, strengthening our health care system, and keeping our children healthy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
