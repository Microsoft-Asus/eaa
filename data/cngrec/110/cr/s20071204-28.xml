    <paragraph>Mr. President, on December 1, America lost a great and innovative educator and a wonderfully decent human being when Sally Smith passed away this week at the age of 78. Sally was the founder and director of one of America's most important teaching institutions, the Lab School in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sally was a New York City native, and longtime resident of the District. She graduated in 1950 from Bennington College, and received a master's degree in education from New York University in 1955. In 1967, inspired by her own son's difficulties in learning, she founded the Lab School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning with just her son and three other students, the Lab School has now grown into an internationally renowned school for students with learning disabilities. Sally's fundamental belief was that all children, no matter what the disability, have the potential, ability and ingenuity to learn. Sally created a unique and innovative learning environment where students are given the tools and encouragement needed to fulfill their goals. She also provided through the Lab School the resources needed  for others to teach students with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, Sally became a professor at the School of Education at American University, where she ran the master's degree program specializing in learning disabilities. The Lab School serves as the primary training site for most graduate students in the program. Sally is the author of 10 books on education. Her teaching techniques have been showcased in a four film series on PBS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Lilibet and I are privileged to have been actively involved with the Lab School over the last 11 years, and we came to know and admire Sally. She was an American original and represented the best of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all of Sally's many friends, Lilibet and I offer our prayers to the Smith family. She leaves the world a better place than she found it. She will be missed by that world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sally is survived by her sons, Randall, Nick and Gary Smith; a sister; and one granddaughter.</paragraph>
