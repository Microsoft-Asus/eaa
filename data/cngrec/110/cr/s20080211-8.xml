  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - February 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="824">S824</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have a very busy week ahead. We are going to finish, as I have indicated, the debate on FISA tonight. We will have a series of votes. We have about seven or eight votes we have to complete tomorrow. We have postcloture debate tomorrow. We need to finish this bill tomorrow, and we will finish it tomorrow. We will complete it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to take a run at the Indian health bill. I spoke with Senator Dorgan this morning. He said he has had a good working relationship with JON KYL and they are very close to being able to finish this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to bring up the conference report on intelligence authorization this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation contains an important provision that would ensure one standard of interrogation across the U.S. Government requiring the CIA to abide by the Army Field Manual dealing with interrogation techniques.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That matter has, it appears, a 60-vote point of order against it. We understand that. I hope we don't have to file  cloture on it. I recognize we have that one vote, and I am happy to arrange a convenient time for everyone to vote. We could move that very quickly, but it is important we do this work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have other things we are looking forward to. I am going to meet with the Republican leader as soon as we finish here to talk about other things we can do so we can be keyed up to work when we come back. We have 3 weeks when we come back after the Presidents Day recess. The last week of that work period we will be dealing with the budget. After that, we are out for the recess for Easter. Then we come back and have an 8-week work period. So we have a lot to do. We think we can do all that, plus  more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is going to be a short but very issue-packed time this year. We have the Presidential elections that are winding down, at least the nomination process, and then we have all the senatorial elections around the country that also take a little extra time. Hopefully, we can join together and get some things done.</paragraph>
