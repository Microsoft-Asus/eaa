    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Buchanan, Georgia, on the occasion of its 150th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The City of Buchanan, which is located in the southwest corner of Georgia's 11th Congressional District, was incorporated on December 22, 1857. Named after former President James Buchanan, Buchanan, Georgia, has served as the county seat of Haralson County since its incorporation back in 1857.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans, we celebrate the role of history in our daily lives, and we strive to preserve the heritage that has shaped us both as a people and as a Nation. Buchanan is truly a living example of that heritage, a city that is small in population, but abundant in heart, and that represents Georgia's warm and welcoming character so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Georgians take great pride in celebrating the traditions of our communities. The growth, rebirth and preservation of these historic towns are important to us all, for these communities are the very backbone of our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, therefore, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the citizens of Buchanan on the city's sesquicentennial celebration of 150 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
