  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of this Nation's strongest allies and friends, Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 60 years now, Israel has been the pride of her people, and a beacon for those who believe in the transformational power of democracy. Our relationship with Israel is built on the bedrock principle that free people and freedom itself must be defended whenever and wherever it is threatened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel itself faces constant threats to its freedom as her people suffer from the most consistent barrage of terrorist attacks the world over. But that does not stop, does not deter, does not prevent Israel from thriving and standing strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a representative of one of the country's largest Jewish communities, I'm proud to rise today in support of Israel, and to congratulate the great State of Israel on its 60th anniversary. May she live strong and free for years to come.</paragraph>
