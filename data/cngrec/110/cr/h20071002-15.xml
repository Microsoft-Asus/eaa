    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what kind of Nation are we? And is anyone really listening?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty-seven million citizens have no health care coverage at all. Zero. And the costs, the costs for care are simply impossible to pay. People cannot afford to pay for their pills, for their doctor bills, for their hospital tests and treatments. They can't even afford their cancer treatments. And why? It's simple. They don't have the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what kind of Nation are we when, in Shawano County in Wisconsin at the courthouse, 19 out of 20 families going bankrupt do so because they can't pay their medical bills?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a uniquely American solution to this crisis and we need it now because my patients can't hold their breath any longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker what kind of Nation are we? Let's all agree here, right now and right here to change this situation. This is a national disgrace. My constituents are listening and so are yours. Let's end this national nightmare and guarantee access to affordable care for everyone everywhere in these United States.</paragraph>
