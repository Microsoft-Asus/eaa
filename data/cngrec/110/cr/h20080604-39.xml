    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is incredibly important legislation, and I hope it doesn't devolve into the partisan debate that's been going on earlier today to point the fingers of blame on the current high cost of gasoline at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about another crisis the American people are experiencing, not as widespread as the cost of fuel, but the impact will be even heavier on more than 600 counties in 42 States and hundreds of school districts across America. This is the issue of whether or not we should continue to compensate these counties for the fact that they have very high ownership of Federal lands and Federal forests. Federal forest policy has changed, and their revenues have diminished dramatically, and many of them  have no alternative, under their State constitution or other laws, to go out and replace those funds, particularly in the short term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's expensive. It would cost $1.9 billion over 4 years. But being sensitive to the fact that many of us on this side of the aisle feel that the policies of recent years have put the country on the verge of bankruptcy, we pay for it. In fact, with the value of what we have in here as a so-called offset in Washington speak, the way we pay for it, with fees on offshore oil leases that were inadvertently omitted by the Clinton administration, would raise $3.3 billion. That means we pay for rural  schools and counties. That's 7,000 teachers. That's hundreds of deputy sheriffs, hundreds of corrections officers, many roadworkers, other critical public safety folks, public health, all across 42 States in America and 600 counties. We pay for that with this bill. In fact, we would help reduce the deficit, which is something we're handing off to our kids and we do need to deal with, by $1.4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some will object to the offset, that the oil companies shouldn't be required to pay a fee even though they got this royalty relief without a cap inadvertently, by mistake, by a previous administration. I really hope that they don't take the debate down that path. That does not do the counties, the schools, the teachers, the police, the deputies, and the others justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's focus on the issue at hand. They have an alternative to fund this. I have been trying desperately for more than a year. It's been quite some time since this bill came out of committee, and Mr. Walden and I joined in a bipartisan way earlier this year in a letter on January 18 to the majority asking that this bill be brought up. And then Mr. Walden on May 1 came to the floor with Mr. Blunt and asked that  the bill be brought  up. In fact, he sent out a press release saying it's been 44 legislative days and over 3 months, that it's a strongly bipartisan bill. I hope it stays bipartisan. To extend county payments has been ready for a vote on the House floor. I simply do not understand why the Democratic leadership has not scheduled a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the Democratic leadership has now scheduled a vote. And I hope that we can get back to the bipartisanness. I hope we can get back to the focus of this debate. Let's pass this bill and move it over to the Senate. If you don't like the way it's paid for, if you want to protect the royalty relief for the oil and gas industry, then vote "present," send the bill to the Senate, and see if they can come up with, as they claim, a better way to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is, to be honest, a very sad day on this bill today on the floor. As an educator, I simply understand the need for secure rural schools funding. As a westerner and someone who served for a long time in the State legislature, I understand what payment in lieu of taxes, or PILT, means to western counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, though, this bill that is before us today did not get here through regular order. This is not the same bill we discussed in committee nor is it the same bill that I and some others cosponsored. It appears almost as if political games are now being played in an effort to pass this particular bill, which breaks new ground. The precedent has always been, in dealing with secure rural schools and PILT, that we have dealt in a bipartisan manner in an effort to find legal and politically  feasible solutions to pay for secure rural schools and payment in lieu of taxes. We have always addressed these two issues in a bipartisan manner, always, until now. <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, this version of it, has broken that covenant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a version of this numbered bill was passed in the Resources Committee, two promises were made to the Republicans who cosponsored it, Mr. Walden and me and others. The first promise was that PILT would not be decoupled from secure rural schools. I cannot stress enough the importance of PILT funding being coupled with secure rural schools, as was promised. Even the majority leader in the Senate has said this is the key to the success of this piece of legislation. And yet this promise  was broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the offset using the 1998/1999 lease moneys was supposed to be taken out by the time this came to the floor. This set of money, which has already been spent three times on three different bills, not the same pot of money, the exact same dollars which have been spent, is not going to be a solution to this. The gentleman from Oregon suggested last night that there might be constitutional concerns and we should not listen to those. I have some sympathy for that approach, but the fact of  the matter is his speech last night was to the wrong audience. It should be to the lower courts, who have already ruled that this pot of money is not accessible to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 we passed the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act. Using these fees for that was justifiable. Using it in this bill is not justifiable. Those fees for the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act was to fund programs and projects related to conservation of OCS-related resources. It was to increase America's energy supply and encourage domestic energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf. Because we are no longer using that and have now taken them to a different level, it will be a breach of  the oil and gas leases and designed to punish energy companies and discourage much-needed domestic oil and gas production. This bill sends now a message to every energy company in America that Congress will not respect lease contracts and will result in less oil, less gas production, which I certainly hope is not the objective of the Democratic Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to have a different way of paying for this bill that does not include an energy price-increasing bankrupt offset. We need a genuine offset that will pay for both PILT and secure rural schools without making America's energy more expensive, less available. And to be honest, if the court upholds their ruling that they already had, if the other courts do, there won't be any money for secure rural schools in this project anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know there will be people who will tell us this is merely a bogus placeholder. We don't really mean to use this money as the bill progresses through, which simply shows that perhaps PAYGO is nothing more than an accounting game or scam as we're looking at it, and that all we need to do is give a blank check over to the Senate, pass it along, and they will fill in some reasonable way of funding this particular bill. We will abdicate our responsibility of coming up with legal, legitimate,  responsible legislation because somewhere down the line, someone else will do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Senate, indeed, has a secret magical formula for funding this bill, why wasn't it in the farm bill? Why wasn't it in the extension of the Rural Schools Act? Why did the Senate not put it in a bill and send it over here? Or why did the sponsor not negotiate with the Senate to insert it in this bill so we could discuss it in the House?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The promise was before this bill to the floor there would be a legitimate source for an offset. It is not there. Instead, we seem to be playing a game of political gotcha, which is so sad because there was a compromise that could have funded this bill and done it in a legally effective way. It was presented by the National Education Association on behalf of schools. It was supported by the consortium of counties. It was supported by energy producers that would have fully funded PILT, fully funded  the secure rural schools, expanded energy options. It would have given States control over sand and gravel for beach replenishment, over the viewshed, States control over their offshore renewable energies, would have funded energy and minerals higher education</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question that we have to ask ourselves today is why are we confronted on suspension with a bill that has a phony PAYGO offset, money that we know is not there? Why are we presented with a suspension bill that has already been rejected by the Senate, that has already been rejected by the administration? Why instead did we not agree to go with the compromise approach, which would have had real offsets and provided real solutions to fully fund our schools, to fully fund PILT, and not to have  to take it out of the hide of anyone who stops at a gas pump this weekend? Now, that's what we should have done, and we didn't do it. And that's why this is a very, very sad day on a bill that was not discussed in committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>It's not phony, it's just painful. Schools, teachers, cops, Big Oil. It's a tough choice for some people. Not for me. I'd be happy to stick with this, all the way through sending it to the President. But some on that side of the aisle, particularly in the Senate, don't want to do that. If the money has not been spent because the Republicans in the Senate have rejected it to pay for other valuable things, this is a valuable thing to pay for.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and also thank you for your great work on this bill, Mr. DeFazio, and thank you especially for paying for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members, county governments don't receive property tax for lands owned and controlled by the Federal Government. However, they are obligated to provide services in those areas. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act was created to compensate local governments for the tax exempt status of the public lands within their county. If we fail to reauthorize this important program, teachers will be laid off, kids will be short-changed on their education, and county  roads will go unmaintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, over 1.2 million acres are controlled by the Federal Government. The National Forest Service  land in my district is twice the size of the State of Rhode Island, and every acre, every acre is exempt from property tax. In one of my counties, 40 percent of the roads are within the National Forest. So that county is responsible for maintaining the roads that run through the very property that is exempt from the taxes that pay for our roads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's unconscionable for the Federal Government to walk away from this obligation to rural local governments. Rural counties have no other options. We have made a commitment on this issue. Now let's live up to our word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>As we now talk about a bill that a commitment was made but does not exist anymore, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Herger).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, counties and schools in my district need a lifeline. They don't need partisanship. They don't need a talking point. They need leadership, which will result in an actual law being passed to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secure rural schools has rested on hard work by grassroots supporters and bipartisan efforts in Congress. So why are we moving a bill that divides our coalition by removing PILT and tying secure rural schools to a controversial offset that we know will fail in the Senate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does nothing to help our counties and schools because it has no chance of becoming law. Yesterday, there was an effort to rescue this legislation with a compromise that would extend a lifeline to rural counties and every American through new domestic oil production and lower gas prices. That proposal was rejected because we were told the majority will not allow consideration of any bill that increases domestic oil supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America and our counties and schools deserve better. I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, and I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. DeFazio, for his hard work and tireless work on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost exactly 100 years ago, Congress passed a law creating a partnership with rural counties with a high percentage of Federal land, and Congress realized that because the Federal lands were off-limits to the counties for development and they would never contribute to the tax base, that these counties should be compensated for permanent loss of any tax revenues. The law allowed a percentage of the revenue produced from Federal land resources to be returned to the county. Counties were then  able to use these funds for public safety, public schools, and public roads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, because of changes in Federal forest policy, the revenue for Federal lands has decreased and Federal lands are still off limits for development, and this leads many counties in the American West with dramatic decreases in the tax base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, we passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act in order to provide a stable base of funding to the affected counties. But that act has not been reauthorized and the Federal payments are scheduled to end June 30. This is a very, very serious issue in Oregon and across the American West, where counties have already, in preparation for this date, in preparation for future budgets, begun to issue pink slips. They have issued pink slips to police, firefighters, teachers,  and other essential personnel. It is not an exaggeration to say that Oregonians may have their lives endangered because of these cuts, if they take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that my good friend and colleague from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has submitted would provide an extension of payments through fiscal 2011 to counties that previously received these payments. And to maintain fiscal responsibility, the bill is fully paid for with offsets, and it reduces payments to counties by 15 percent each year, asking all to make sacrifices.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400113" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this program needs to be reauthorized. I represent northeastern California, which is one of the top recipients of money under this Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, which expired a couple of years ago. Just to give you an example, Plumas County School District in my district receives roughly 20 percent of their annual operating budget from these funds. Without this money, the county is prepared to lay off 9 out of the 16 administrators; 47  teachers out of a total of 150; close all school libraries; possibly close some or all cafeterias; and cut transportation services. Another county adjoining Plumas that I represent is Sierra. They would need to lay off nearly 40 percent of their teachers and administrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill will not become law and therefore does nothing to support our rural counties. We cannot continue to go from year to year without this being resolved. In California, if you don't have the funding assured, layoff notices are sent off by March 15 of the year. For the second year in a row, those layoff notices have already gone out. We lose valuable teachers that do not come back once the funding has been restored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This debate should be about schools and public infrastructure, not used as fodder to drive an anti-oil agenda. This process that we are using is deplorable. We were told that PILT would be included, but it was stripped out of the bill on its way to the floor. We were told there would be an acceptable offset, not one that has been rejected on three previous occasions by the U.S. Senate. But there is none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also considering this bill under suspension of the bills, denying the minority a right to offer an alternative and preventing any Member from offering alternative offsets. A compromise has been offered and rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, I would urge defeat of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, the Public Land Communities Transition Act, and I commend my dear friend, Peter DeFazio. I have rarely seen a Member of Congress work so diligently on behalf of his constituents. He also works on behalf of my constituents because in southwest Washington, we are one of the 10 most forested districts in the entire country. So much of the land in my district is under control of the Forest Service. Counties like Lewis, Skamania, and Cowlitz  rely on Secure Rural Schools money to keep public safety working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, we have to work to pass this bill. It is urgent, as many speakers have said. It is a bit ironic, however, to criticize the bill and say the criticism is because this bill will not become law, and then vote against it. Things don't become law around here when people vote against them. Things become law when people vote for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of that, I would encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill. Without this bill, 600 counties across the country that are home to millions of Americans would be left behind. Without this program, millions of rural communities would face steep job losses, breakdowns in services and infrastructure, and deep cuts to school budgets. Without this funding, almost 7,000 teachers and other educational staff will be laid off across the country. They are facing termination as we speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delay should not be an option. Passage should be our remedy. I urge passage of this fine bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, the Public Land Communities Transition Act of 2008. Mr. Speaker, this bill had the opportunity to provide rural schools with  the much-needed funding that allows them to keep their doors open and serve sparsely-populated areas. Unfortunately, the majority decided to offset this bill with provisions that will increase the cost of gas to the American public. Already paying $4 a gallon at the  pumps, Americans should not be forced to bear further increases, especially those living in rural areas that, on average, already drive greater distances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fee increases on oil and gas leases would place further confines on domestic energy production at a time when we need to be expanding production and building our Nation's energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision was included in the farm bill that was brought to the House floor a year ago, and was one of several tax increasing provisions that drew criticism from House Members, as well as the Senate and the White House. It would be disingenuous to sing praises of this bill when the cost of providing support to rural schools would be borne by the very rural constituents we are trying to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a proposed compromise that was introduced in the 109th Congress and enjoyed broad bipartisan support. It would solve the problems created by the oil and gas lease provisions in <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill> by increasing domestic energy exploration and production, thereby helping to reduce the gas prices for the American consumer. At the same time, this alternative would provide the necessary funding for rural school districts. That alternative would be something I could stand behind but, unfortunately,  that is not the bill we are considering today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no." I urge them to vote against the policy that will raise gas prices for Americans when they have the opportunity to do it right and create increased domestic energy production and solve this problem for our rural schools.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. DeFazio, for all of the work that he has done on this bill. Look, I grew up in a family where if you made a promise, you kept that promise. A deal is a deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>County payments available for 100 years are payment for the Federal Government owning 57 percent of the forested land in Oregon. If the Federal Government did not make these payments, these counties would have very little in the way of infrastructure funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This money will cut the following services if we don't have it, and it will impact our most vulnerable citizens: Loss of sheriffs; loss of DAs; loss of economic development services and juvenile services; loss of mental health services, public health, and in general, loss of veterans services and senior services. The loss of county payments means the loss of sheriffs. In just one county, Curry County alone, three sheriffs will have to patrol an area the same size as Connecticut, which has a police  force of 2,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a 4-year extension of the Secure Rural Schools. This program will not continue unless we give this an appropriation. It needs to pass to provide that critical funding for our counties. I cannot over-emphasize the need for this legislation for Oregon and for the Nation to maintain its 100-year-old bargain with the National Forest States. I encourage my colleagues to support its passage today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when this bill came out of the committee, I thought we had an agreement where there would be an offset and a payment of the bill. Unfortunately, that did not occur, so consequently I will be voting against this legislation because it doesn't do what it says it is going to do. Very frankly, this is funny money, and the schools won't be, as we want them to be, funded, and that is unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I am also going to talk about a lot of the statements on the floor, and my good friend from Oregon has to understand that I do watch the debate. There were some statements made that I think were incorrect, in fact I know, not think, about ANWR and about PET4 and about independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been no oil shipped overseas from Alaska. It all goes to the West Coast, at one time through the Panama Canal, through a pipeline, for American consumption, all 17 billion barrels of oil. And if we were to open ANWR or the Chukchi Sea it would go to the United States. It wouldn't go overseas to China or Japan. We could make sure of that as we vote for it on this House floor, as we did when we had the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important that the American public recognize that we do have a supply problem. And anybody who denies that, I have heard these arguments for 25 years, well, we only do have one month or 6 months or whatever it is oil supply, so we shouldn't do it. If we have that 1 million barrels a day, Chavez would not have the ability to blackmail us, or if Nigeria had an upheaval, there wouldn't be the spike in oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of people are pointing their fingers at all the problems, the big oil, the speculators, and I do think there is some merit in the speculators because they know we haven't acted on the supply side ever since the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Not one time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, the Public Land Communities Transition Assistance Act. As the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, I do want to express my deep appreciation to the gentleman from Oregon, PETER DEFAZIO, for his strongly tenacious efforts and determined determination on behalf of this legislation. He has more than adequately explained the bill. My purpose is to stress the urgency of this body acting on the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, commonly referred to as the "county payments bill," was enacted in 2000 to provide stability in revenue sharing payments made to the States and counties containing Federal forest lands. This funding has been extremely important, critically so in many cases, in assisting schools and communities in rural counties across the country, including my home State of West Virginia. Yet the Congress has failed to reauthorize the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress, with a Democratic majority, is attempting to pick up the pieces of a program that was looking at being eliminated square in the eye. Last year we managed to pass a 1-year extension of county payments, but that is due to expire at the end of this month. So I cannot stress enough the urgency of today's vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Critical funding for schools and county services across the country will evaporate if we do not act today. Indeed, the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition estimates that about 7,000 teachers and other educational staff will be laid off as of June 30th when their contracts expire if this body does not act. That is something worth thinking about. Students in rural forest counties across this Nation will be deprived of almost 7,000 teachers and the other educational staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some have taken issue with the pay-for, the offset being used for this bill, which is a conservation of resources fee on a class of Federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that  are unduly enjoying royalty relief by virtue of not having price thresholds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a new proposal. This body has considered it before, and rightly so. My colleagues, to date the American people have been deprived of over $1 billion in Federal royalties as a result of this situation. That is over 1 billion with a "B" dollars, something worth thinking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now learn that in the future if this situation is not corrected, the American people will be fleeced to the tune of $4 billion and to a high of $14 billion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>That figure could go as high as $14 billion, depending on the price of oil and natural gas and the amount produced from these leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is very important that we recognize this bill does have funding sources and that is what we are trying to do here, at the same time generating funds to pay for teachers and the education of our school children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons this Congress has the lowest approval ratings in poll history is it keeps playing political games instead of solving real problems like energy prices or supporting our troops in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are doing the same, playing games with our rural schools, with our rural counties, with our rural firefighters and police forces. Unfortunately, this bill is deader than a doornail, only because some political genius decided they would like to pit those of us who support rural schools against our energy companies. Well, guess what? Everyone loses, especially our rural communities who fought for this. This bill is a shame.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. It's teachers or cops or Big Oil.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, the Public Land Communities Transition Assistance Act, and I too thank the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, for his tireless efforts to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program. I also thank the House Committee on Natural Resources and the House leadership for their work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill> would reauthorize the secure rural schools program for 4 years. Annual payments to counties impacted by National Forest lands are an important part of many school districts' budgets, and failure to reauthorize the Secure Rural schools would force very difficult decisions in counties and school districts in over 40 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the State of South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest is a special place and a highly valued resource. Yet the national ownership of this land has clear impacts on finances of counties in western South Dakota. For example, under the Secure Rural Schools program, Custer County schools receive approximately $310,000 for the 2007-2008 school year. If this program isn't reauthorized, Custer schools would receive about $90,000. The loss of $210,000 would likely lead to eliminating numerous  teaching positions and increasing class sizes to as many as 40 students per class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Custer County isn't alone. If we fail to reauthorize the secure rural schools program, almost 7,000 teachers and other educational staff will be laid off across the country as of June 30, 2008, when their contracts expire. <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill> provides a new distribution formula and transition payments as counties adjust.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>On the offset, by my count, 48 of my Republican colleagues have in the past voted for legislation that included this offset. That was all in 2007, before oil went over $100 a barrel.

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we have arrived here today like an out-of-control car skidding to a stop. Let's not forget why we are here. We are here because of a changed Federal timber policy that has bankrupted the people that live in my district and many of yours, and as a result we now have fires at costs that are unbelievable. They are historic. We are burning more acres of our Federal forests than at any time in our Nation's history, and we are paying more for  it. Forty-seven percent of the Federal budget for the Forest Service now goes to put out fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet we have shut down the Federal forests from active management. That is why we are here today, because the revenues that used to flow to our communities to pay for basic services, to be the good partner that Teddy Roosevelt envisioned the great forest reserves more than 100 years ago, to be a partnership with the local community, that partnership, that bond, that pledge has been broken. People are put out of work. Services are lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tragedy that brings us here today is another broken promise, and that is when this bill was considered by the House Natural Resources Committee there was a consistent and common pledge that this bill would be brought to the floor with a different offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a quote here from the spokesperson from the committee that makes that very clear. It says very clearly, it is definitely our intention for the money not to come from increased fees on oil and gas companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is definitely not our intention for the money to come from increased fees on oil and gas companies. That is what the committee said. I just couldn't read it. It is too far in front of me. I apologize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That clearly is not the case. It is clearly not the case. So we have before us a bill with a broken promise, first of all, and it didn't have to be that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, I have come to this floor repeatedly and called for this bill to come to this floor for consideration. I don't know why it was held hostage for 130 or so days. But I came here calling for this bill to come to the floor with the clear understanding, the promise and pledge of that committee that it would come here with a different offset, one that was palatable. That promise and pledge was broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, I know the Speaker was out in Oregon a while back and said where we go from here is we ought to phase out that system. That doesn't sound like the Speaker is very supportive to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have here today is an offset of questionable legality. And I say that not because I am a lawyer, I am not, but because of court cases that have occurred that said when it comes to levying a fee on conservation of resources on the Outer Continental Shelf, that leases that exist today prohibit the application of future laws and regulations except future regulations related to conservation of the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does that mean in real people talk? It means if you are going to levy the fee that you plan to levy, you have to spend it in a legal way, which is on conservation efforts on the Outer Continental Shelf, or else the courts will say you are not following the decisions we already gave you, Mobil v. U.S., among others. So this is of questionable legal status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I asked my colleague from Oregon, we talked, we have worked really closely on this issue over the years in  a bipartisan manner, and I said I think we are going to have a lot of problems on our side with this and I don't think it is legal. And indeed that is where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have exchanged letters. My colleague wrote me on May 30. Mr. DeFazio said if you have other suggestions for offsets that won't raise the ire of oil patch or mineral-dependent Members, I would welcome the input. So we talked on Monday and I said give me a day. This is rushed on the suspension of the rules. Give me a day to come up with an alternative, and we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spent all day yesterday with the Congressional Budget Office, technical experts, legal experts, and we came up with a proposal that legally funds county payments, legally and fully funds PILT, legally and fully accesses energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is very similar to a proposal that my colleague from the Fourth District voted for that was passed by this house less than 2 years ago that would generate revenue legally. By the way, for those 98-99 leases, we do levy a fee  so that they do pay, but we do it in a constitutional legal way so it is applied for conservation, coastal line improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So we get at the 98-99 lease issue in a legal way under this proposal. The Coalition of County Roads and Schools, we presented this to them yesterday afternoon, they embraced it wholeheartedly. But it was rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under suspension of the rules, I am not allowed to offer it as an alternative. If this bill goes down today on a vote on the suspension calendar, it can be brought up. The placeholder that this represents is a seat on a bus going into a cliff. It is going off the cliff and into a chasm. Fortunately, there is a cable attached to that bus. If this goes down today, counties aren't lost. They can come back, bring it up under a rule and we can have a real and substantive debate about a way to fully  fund it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 30, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR GREG: As you know, I worked with the administration to come up with several other potential offsets to pay for a multi-year extension of the county payments program. Unfortunately, those offsets were strongly objected to on a bi-partisan basis. If you have other suggestions for offsets that won't raise the ire of oil patch or mineral-dependent members, I would welcome the input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to talking to you this afternoon or on Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PETER A. DEFAZIO,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just in response, the gentleman asked three times to bring this bill to the floor with these offsets, and the gentleman from Utah actually said in committee: I am specifically looking at offshore drilling fees, which is a concept of a new fee that is there. I am more than happy to go in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today they're not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership and tireless effort to help keep this alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the frustration of my friend from Oregon that just spoke. He should be frustrated, because his Republican Party was in total control for 6 years with the Presidency, with both Houses of Congress, and there is a situation that he doesn't like. I understand it. I understand his frustration. If I were in his position, I would be, too. It was the Republican Congress that did not extend this program and allowed it to expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a simple choice before us today where we have an opportunity to deal with the needs of hundreds of thousands of rural Americans, not just in Oregon, but from 40 States around the country, or the interests of a few oil companies who are making money hand over fist, and they are making some money that they shouldn't because they are not paying what they should under the leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already dealt with this canard that somehow the answer is to give the oil industy access to more land to drill. Oil companies have been granted 42 million acres of which they are only using 12 million currently, so they have 30 million acres of area that they could potentially drill and they are not drilling now. Somehow we should come up with something more to give to them, allow them to have more money, ignores the issue here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest that we ought to respect the work of Mr. DEFAZIO in bringing this forward. Frankly, I was frustrated at the negative comment about Speaker PELOSI who said that, instead of pushing these people off a cliff, that she would work to cushion the blow, to help phase it down. She was trying to help instead of cutting them off. She has been helpful in moving this forward, and taking a shot at the Speaker is unfair and if you are trying to solve the problem, it is unwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the Republicans for 6 years that had the control, who didn't exercise it. This is a constructive alternative. I suggest that we recognize the need of these hundreds of thousands of Americans, not a few oil companies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Chairman Rahall from the committee coming down here earlier to speak on the bill. When this bill was under his control, he treated us with kindness and consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the tornado of words that we have heard here today, there is one thought that still comes through: We need a permanent solution. This bill is half a bill without a permanent solution and without an offset that is legitimate. The counties, the education community, and the energy companies presented a real solution that would really pay, not a phony placeholder, but real money that would pay for full tilt, full secure rural schools, a real solution to real problems. This bill is the wrong bill,  the wrong process, at the wrong time, and should be defeated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a difficult choice. It is always difficult to choose between your constituents and your patrons. The patrons heavily to that side of that aisle have been Big Oil. This would hurt Big Oil. They would actually have to pay a fee for leases that were written improperly where they don't pay any royalties to the American taxpayers at a time of record prices. That hurts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, it is true. So far, a bare minority of Senators have rejected it, previously. Maybe they won't this time. Maybe with oil at $125 a barrel they will go along with it and say we can get some good out of this for a change. We can help kids get an education. We can keep teachers employed. We can provide money to police our counties and to keep people in jail who need to be there, and for other public services and public works. We can do those things. But we have got to have some guts. Every  once in a while you have got to stand up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hear all this stuff, all we need is more leases. Their staff boycotted a meeting last week. They sprung a proposal last night, which is a Republican bill, not a single Democrat on it, and would open up offshore oil drilling, which is not acceptable to the Republican Governor of California, to the Republican Governor of Florida, and many others. It is a nonstarter. Come on, guys, let's get real. This is your choice. This is it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 6,312 nonproducing leases on the OCS. This bill would make those companies begin to produce, or pay a fee for not producing. If you want to help provide more supply, which is what a lot of the debate has been about today, let's impose a fee on those 6,312 wells. And, in the meantime, let's get some good of that money for the American people. Help 7,000 teachers, help the kids in rural schools, help our deputy sheriffs, help our people who do corrections, help the people who have a backlog  of road and bridge projects all across rural America. Help 42 States. Help 600 counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is your only vote. This is your time. Sometimes you have to make tough choices. I urge an "aye" vote on this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, represents a thinly veiled attempt to create a partisan fight over a nonpartisan issue. For several years now, Members from both sides of the aisle have struggled to find a way to pay for the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools program.  We have found such a compromise in Congressman Walden's substitute to <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>. But that is not what we are voting on today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Walden compromise that has been approved by the stakeholder organizations contains reauthorization of both Payments in Lieu of Taxes and the Secure Rural Schools program which are so vital for people whose counties are majority owned by the Federal Government, and thus don't have the property tax base to support education. But that is not the bill we are voting on today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed Walden compromise addresses our growing energy crisis by expanding state control and protection of the outer continental shelf, and by producing new energy in the deep ocean. It provides funding for front-end engineering and design grants for coal-to-liquids, oil shale, tar sands, carbon sequestration, and enhanced oil recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Walden's compromise proposal contains provisions that have been previously debated on this floor, passed by this body, and approved by the administration. But that is not the bill we are voting on today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are voting on today breaks contracts that were negotiated in good faith between the previous administration and American energy providers. The bill we are voting on today has prompted a veto threat, and will probably not even make it through the House today. If the majority wants to make this a partisan vote, so be it. That is their prerogative. But let me make one thing clear; the superintendents of Groveton, Crockett, Latexo, Grapeland, Lovelady, and Kennard Independent School Districts  do not care about partisanship. The reality of what we are doing today is that these, and thousands of other school administrators, are going to have to cut jobs and programs as they see their revenues shrink drastically. All for the sake of making a political statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress decided to take land out of the tax base of thousands of rural counties in order to create our National Forest System, we made a promise to help cover the cost of education. We have a chance to fulfill this promise by taking up the Walden compromise for Secure Rural Schools and PILT reauthorization. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the political stab before us today, and I urge majority to bring to the floor Congressman Walden's proposal as soon as possible. Our rural  communities depend on it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, the Public Lands Communities Transition Act.

Without these funds, these school districts will have to make large cuts to their educational services and programs.</paragraph>
