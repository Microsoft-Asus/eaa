    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Americans are fed up paying over $4 per gallon for gas and nearly $5 for diesel. The price of a gallon of gas has spiked $2 since Democrats took control of Congress in January of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's high time we did something about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline and allow us to explore for oil right here in America. To bring down the price of gasoline, we need to expand U.S. refinery capacity, tap America's own energy resources, streamline the number of fuel blends and promote the use of clean, alternative energy. With a nationwide price for gasoline now over $4 a gallon, it's no surprise a recent Gallup Poll showed 57 percent of Americans now favor further exploration for oil right  here in America. These folks are right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Come on, America, let's strike oil.</paragraph>
