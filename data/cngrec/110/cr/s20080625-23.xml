  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 11 through 13, the residents of Richardton will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richardton is located in Stark County in the southwest part of the State. Oscar L. Richard named the town in 1882 after his relative, C.B. Richard, who was an agent for the Hamburg-American Steamship Co., which promoted German-Russian settlement in this area. The post office was established a year later by Adolph Norberg. In 1906, the village was incorporated, and Richardton was officially recognized as a city in 1935.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richardton has a prominent Roman Catholic monastery, which was founded by Bishop Vincent DePaul Wehrle in 1899. Vincent was the first Abbot of the monastery, which was named St. Mary's Priory, from 1903-1910. Under his leadership, the great twin-tower cathedral was built in 1906.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Mary's faced significant challenges after its completion in 1910 which eventually led to its closure. Abbot Alcuin Deutsch of St. John's Abbey in Minnesota wanted to revive the Richardton community because it was still struggling financially. In 1926, Abbot Deutsch and other monks around North Dakota helped reopen the monastery with the name Assumption Abbey. Assumption Abbey remains in operation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richardton's attractions also include a golf course, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, motels and much more. Residents of Richardton take great pride in their community. To celebrate their 125th centennial anniversary, the community will be holding a 5k walk/run, a parade, games, an antique car show, a Rough Rider Rodeo, a dance, and a fireworks show.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Richardton, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Richardton and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Richardton that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richardton has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
