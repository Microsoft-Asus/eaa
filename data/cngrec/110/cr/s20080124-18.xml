  <narrative>THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - January 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="277">S277</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 22, 2007, Matthew Shetima was walking through an alley in Farmington, NM, when he encountered three men. Shetima, a gay man, claims that Scott Thompson, 21, Jerry Paul, 40, and Craig Yazzie, 37, all from New Mexico, called him over as he walked by the men. According to the police report, the three men began to hit Shetima, all of them calling him derogatory names as they struck him. According to the police report, when he fell to the ground, at least one of the men asked him if he  wanted to die as they continued to kick him. Shetima was then pulled into the hotel room the three men were staying in, where the assault continued. Fortunately, Shetima was able to escape. The district attorney prosecuting the case is seeking sentencing enhancements for all three men under New Mexico's hate crime law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
