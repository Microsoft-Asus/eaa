  <narrative>PRACTICAL ENERGY SOLUTIONS NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6452]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for literally months now, House Republicans have come to the floor in a concerted effort to convince Democratic leadership to bring legislation to the floor that would allow us to drill here and drill now so we can all pay less at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even as we offered practical energy solutions and a willingness to work with the majority, Speaker Pelosi has continually blocked such legislation from coming for a vote here in the House, and we are not the only ones who have noticed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, here is a headline from today's Roll Call newspaper. Here is what it says: "Pelosi maneuvers to block drilling votes. Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears intent on preventing votes on opening more areas to offshore drilling, despite the stirrings of a revolt by rank-and-file Democrats after months of concerted efforts by House Republicans." This was in Roll Call today, Monday, July 14, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this article notes, we are starting to hear some rumblings from Members on the Democratic side of the aisle who are ready to put partisan politics aside and work with Republicans on compromise legislation that will start to decrease our pain at the pump. Increasing numbers of rank-and-file Democrats seem to have grown tired of their leadership's failure to allow votes on legislation that will break our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to show a couple of posters here and some quotes. The first quote, "Americans need Congress to look at real solutions in addressing our energy needs, especially when we have $4 a gallon gasoline. We need answers and not just slogans. We need to do it all. We have Senators going to Saudi Arabia begging them to increase their production, but we won't increase ours in some of the most, potential, productive areas?" That was a quote from a floor remark made June 26, 2008, by  Mr. Gene Green of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Here is another one. Another quote, "Then we better get started, because the longer we delay, the more we're jeopardizing the American economy." That quote came from Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE, the gentleman from Hawaii, on Fox News on July 7 of this year, a member, NEIL ABERCROMBIE, of the Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members on both sides of the aisle understand that there is not one single solution to our current energy crisis, and that we must work in a bipartisan way to develop a comprehensive plan to alleviate the pain that American families face every time they fill their gas pumps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the leadership of Representative JOHN PETERSON of Pennsylvania, and, as I said, Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE of Hawaii. They are now heading up a working group to form legislation that incorporates long-term energy solutions while also providing short-term relief for Americans who are now, today, paying $4.11 a gallon of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan approach is what we need to find a solution. House Republicans stand ready to find a middle way that not only guarantees an increase in domestic production, but it also addresses concerns about excessive speculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While House Republicans are prepared for a comprehensive approach that looks not only at supply but also market factors, Speaker Pelosi must be willing to, at the very least, allow an up or down vote on increasing domestic supply. She must recognize that the American people don't want any option left off the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As further indication that we need to increase the domestic supply of oil, President Bush today lifted the 18 year-old executive order that prohibited responsible energy exploration along our Nation's Outer Continental Shelf. Let me show my colleagues that poster. Here is the quote, "In another push to deal with soaring gas prices, President Bush on Monday will lift an executive ban on offshore drilling that has stood since his father was president. But the move, by itself, will do nothing unless  Congress acts as well." This was from the Associated Press today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This decision leaves Congress as the last remaining hurdle to domestically producing billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas for the American people. Allowing our Nation to explore the energy resources available off of our coast would be a great first step toward declaring America's energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to have a comprehensive approach, and I hope Members on both sides of the aisle recognize that, and we need action now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, sound energy policy is being held hostage by Speaker NANCY PELOSI because she believes that it is more important to pander to out-of-control environmentalists than to enact a "common-sense plan" to lower gas prices--as she promised to the American people over 2 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as American families and small businesses face record prices at the pump, they are counting on their leaders in Congress to work together on reforms to help reduce fuel costs. I call on Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Leadership to listen to House Republicans, a growing coalition of House Democrats and most importantly the American people--allow a vote on legislation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
