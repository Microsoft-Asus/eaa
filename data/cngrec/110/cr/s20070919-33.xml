FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Women around the world are especially vulnerable to poverty. They tend to work longer hours, are compensated less, and have less income stability and fewer economic opportunities than men.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Women's share of the labor force is increasing in almost all regions of the world. Women comprise more than 40 percent of the labor force in eastern and southeastern Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean, nearly a third of the labor force in Central America, and nearly one-third of total employment in South Asia. About 250 million young women will enter the labor force worldwide between 2003 and 2015.</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) Women are more likely to work in informal employment relationships in poor countries compared to men. In sub-Saharan Africa, 84 percent of female non-agricultural workers are informally employed compared to 63 percent of men. In Latin America, 58 percent of women are informally employed compared to 48 percent of men. Informal employment is characterized by lower wages and greater variability of earnings, less stability, absence of labor organization, and  fewer  social protections than formal employment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Changes in the economy of a poor country affect women and men differently; women are disproportionately affected by long-term recessions, crises, and economic restructuring and they often miss out on many of the benefits of growth.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) International trade can be an important tool of economic development and poverty reduction and its benefits should extend to all members of society, particularly the world's poor women.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Promoting fair labor practices for women, and access to information, education, land, credit, physical capital, and social services is a means of boosting productivity and earnings for the economies of developing nations. For example, according to the World Bank, in sub-Saharan Africa, inequality between men and women in employment and education suppressed annual per capita growth during the period 1960-1992 by .8 percentage points per year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Expanding economic opportunity for women in developing countries can have a positive effect on child nutrition, health, and education, as women often invest their income in their families. Increasing women's income can also decrease women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence, and trafficking, and make them more resistant to the impact of natural disasters.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Economic opportunities for women, including microfinance and microenterprise development and the promotion of women's small- and medium-sized businesses, are a means of generating gainful, safe, and dignified employment for the poor.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Women play a vital, but often unrecognized, role in averting violence, resolving conflict, and rebuilding economies in post-conflict societies. Women in conflict-affected areas face even greater challenges in accessing employment, training, property rights, credit, and financial and non-financial resources for business development. Ensuring economic opportunity for women in conflict-affected areas plays a significant role in economic rehabilitation and consolidation of peace.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Given the important role of women in the economies of poor nations, poverty alleviation programs funded by the Government of the United States in poor countries should seek to enhance the level of economic opportunity available to women in those countries.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Statement of Policy.--It is, therefore, the policy of the United States to actively promote development and economic opportunities for women, including programs and policies to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) promote women's ability to start micro, small, or medium-sized business enterprises, and enable women to grow such enterprises, particularly from micro to small enterprises and from small to medium-sized enterprises, or sustain current business capacity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) promote the rights of women to own, manage, and inherit property, including land, encourage adoption of laws and policies that support the rights of women to enforce these claims in administrative and judicial tribunals, and address conflicts with customary laws and practices to increase the security of women's tenure;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) increase women's access to employment, enable women to access higher quality jobs with better remuneration and working conditions in both informal and formal employment, and improve the quality of jobs in sectors dominated by women by improving the remuneration and working conditions of those jobs; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) bring the benefits of international trade policy to women in developing countries and continue to ensure that trade policies and agreements adequately reflect the respective needs of poor women and men.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 2071. A bill to enhance the ability to combat methamphetamine; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2071">S. 2071</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senators Baucus, Boxer, Obama, Clinton, and Ben Nelson, the Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act is designed to address problems that the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, has identified in the implementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. I was pleased to join former Senator Talent in drafting, introducing and securing the passage of the original bill. I am pleased to introduce this legislation today to ensure that it operates as Congress intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that I introduce today would: clarify that all retailers, including mail order retailers, who sell products that contain chemicals often used to make methamphetamine--like ephedrine, pseudoepedrine and phenylpropanolamine--must self-certify that they have trained their personnel and will comply with the Combat Meth Act's requirements; require distributors to sell these products only to retailers who have certified that they will comply with the law; require the DEA to publish the list  of all retailers who have filed self-certifications, on the DEA's website; and clarify that any retailer who negligently fails to file self-certification as required, may be subject to civil fines and penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act that we passed last year has been a resounding success. The number of methamphetamine labs in the United States has declined dramatically now that the ingredients used to make methamphetamine are harder to get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Combat Meth Act that became effective in September 2006 included important new provisions for retailer self-certification, employee training, requiring products to be placed behind counters, packaging requirements, required sales logbooks, and limits on the amounts that a person can purchase in a given day and over a 30-day period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, because of that law's implementation, the number of methamphetamine labs decreased from about 12,000 labs to about 7,300 labs--a 41 percent decrease in just one year. Once the bill was enacted into law, the number of meth "super labs" in my home State of California declined from 30 in 2005 to only 17 in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fewer meth labs means more than just less illegal drug production. As the Fresno Bee reported today, the DEA has noted that in 2003, 3663 children were reported exposed to toxic meth labs nationwide--but so far this year, the number of exposed children is only 319.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So things are moving in the right direction, and that is good news. But with more than 7,000 methamphetamine labs in the U.S., and children still being exposed to their toxins, it is also clear that there is still work to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Combat Meth Act became law, DEA examined how the retailer self-certification process was working. On May 16, 2007, DEA sent letters to the 1600 distributors who they believed were selling products that contained ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, asking them to turn over lists of the retail stores that they sell to, so that DEA could check to see how many of those retailers had self-certified as that law requires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than actively assisting the DEA in its efforts, about  3/4  of the distributors failed or declined to provide any information about the retail stores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distributors who did cooperate provided DEA with the names of 12,375 retail customers. When DEA checked those out, it found that about 8,300 of those retail stores had never self-certified as the law requires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on these findings, the DEA estimates that nationwide, as many as 30,000 additional retail sellers of products are not complying with the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, retailers' noncompliance with the self-certification requirement appears to be widespread, and undercuts the effectiveness of the Combat Meth Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no effective way for law enforcement to determine the universe of who is, and who is not, obeying the law. Currently, there is no requirement that retailers notify the DEA before they start selling products with these listed chemicals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retailers can likely avoid negative consequences if they are ever confronted with their failure to self-certify. Currently, the law imposes sanctions only for willful and reckless refusals to self-certify. There is no punishment available if a retailer negligently fails to self-certify as required. Not even civil sanctions are available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, without distributors restricting the supply of these products to retailers who have self-certified, retailers may simply take their chances, rather than self-certifying as the law intended, figuring that they will never get caught, or if they do get caught, that they will never be punished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unacceptable that, a year after the Combat Meth Act imposed this requirement and became fully effective, tens of thousands of retailers still are not following the law. It is unacceptable that distributors of these products can continue to profit off of their sales to retailers who are not complying, or are even refusing to comply with the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill is designed to make the Combat Meth Act more effective, by putting in place a process that will ensure that every retailer who orders these products that can be used to make methamphetamine must comply with the law before they can get and resell the products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it will require that all retail sellers of products with these listed chemicals must file self-certifications, closing a loophole that now exists for mail-order retailers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the DEA will be required to post all self-certified retailers on its website, so that advocacy groups and others who are concerned about methamphetamine in their communities can identify retailers who are selling these products without complying with the law, and can notify the authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, distributors of these products will only be allowed to sell to retailers who have self-certified which they will be able to verify by checking the DEA's public website. Once recalcitrant retailers are faced with the real and immediate economic consequence of a possible cut-off of their desire to purchase these products, I am confident that most will file self-certifications as the law requires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill clarifies that even a negligent failure to self-certify, if proven, can give rise to civil sanctions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a common-sense bill, designed to strengthen the implementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. This bill would create incentives to ensure that the self-certification process of the law is made both effective and enforceable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
