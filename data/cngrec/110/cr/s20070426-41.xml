    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak about community spirit. In the Senate, we work day in and day out to pass good policy that will provide for the safety, security, and health of  the Nation, but we are not alone in our effort to make our country better. In fact, we are but a small part. There are great events taking place every day in our country that are examples of neighbor helping neighbor, people who do not wait and do not ask for help  but take it upon themselves to act. I would like to tell you about one such example that has been going on for years in Wyoming right in the small community I call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people think about my hometown of Gillette, WY, many images come to mind--sagebrush as far as the eye can see, coal trucks, and cattle herds. We have deer, antelope, and some buffalo in the neighboring community of Wright. Our kids are great basketball players, and we work hard to get the methane gas and minerals that power this country. The list goes on. But after living in Gillette for more than three decades, what stands out about home are the people themselves, their character, their  sense of community, and how they come together to help each other. And then there is the crawfish. Yes, I said crawfish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, Gillette will be kicking off a 24-year tradition of flying in 10,000 pounds of crawfish for the annual Crawfish Boil. The event raises money for local families with medical hardships and was started in 1983 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The event raised $117,000 last year to help people get medical treatment. This weekend we hope to top that number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wyoming may be small in population, but our families know how to help each other out more than any other State in the Nation. Wyomingites do not just rely on government for help--they talk to neighbors, they come up with a good idea, they organize, and they follow through. The crawfish feed is an example for the Nation on how to pull yourself and your neighbor up by the bootstraps and have fun doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gillette not only raised $117,000 at last year's Crawfish Boil, the Festival of Trees raised $51,500 for hospice and lifeline services, the Chili Cook-Off raised $28,800 for the Council of Community Services, the Black Cat Ball raised $26,000 for the Hospice Hospitality House, the Chuckles for Charity event raised $24,000 for the Gillette Area Refuge, and the Rotary Ball raised $40,000 for education and other programs in Gillette. Mr. President, $287,000 in 1 year, in one community with roughly  25,000 residents. I could not think of a better place to call home.</paragraph>
