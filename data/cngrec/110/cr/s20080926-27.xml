  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was proud to be a cosponsor, but I am especially proud of the lead sponsor, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. This is a matter he has cared passionately about, and he has worked tirelessly. He relied not only on his own family experience but also the experiences of so many other thousands of families who have seen Senator Kennedy as a champion. I applaud him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been in constant contact with Senator Kennedy during the time we have been talking about this issue. Incidentally, we are, of course, talking about The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act. I have talked with him about his personal experience and with those who are mentally ill, and his concern about this whole subject has been shown time and time again. So I applaud Senator Kennedy and all the other cosponsors for what  they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Senate will finally turn to legislation to reauthorize the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. Though this bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee in April, it has stalled on the Senate floor for 5 months due to Republican objection. I am glad that we are moving forward on this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a sponsor of the original authorization of this Act in 2004, and I am proud that these programs have helped State and local governments to reduce crime by providing more effective treatment for the mentally ill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the reauthorization of this important legislation in this Congress, and I thank Senators Kennedy, Domenici, and Specter for their leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All too often, people with mental illness find themselves in a revolving door between the criminal justice system and the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor offenses. These offenders end up in prisons or jails, where little or no appropriate medical care is available for them. This bill gives State and local governments the tools to break this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, the public's safety, and the mentally ill offenders themselves. More  than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, and about 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems. Almost half the inmates in prison with a mental illness were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent crime. This is a serious problem that I hear about often when I talk with law enforcement officials and others in Vermont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to create or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, which can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; create or expand programs to provide specialized training for criminal justice and mental health system personnel; create or expand local treatment programs that serve individuals with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; and promote and provide mental  health treatment for those incarcerated in or released from jails and prisons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The grants created under this program have been in high demand, but only about 11 percent of the applications submitted have been able to receive funding due to the scarce Federal funds available. The bill's sponsors and I worked hard to determine an appropriate authorization level of funding, which has unfortunately been slashed  in this bill in order to accommodate the objection of the junior Senator from Oklahoma. I look forward to working with Senators</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and mental health professionals to help respond to the needs of our communities. They are familiar with the unique problems states face with mentally ill offenders, and they understand the importance of federal support. I am glad the Republican objection to moving this bill forward has been lifted, and I hope the House passes this important bill swiftly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, Senator Leahy, and Senator Specter, to laud the passage of <bill type="s" number="2304">S. 2304</bill>, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2008. This bill reauthorizes and improves several programs intended to provide federal support for collaborations between criminal justice and mental health systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must first show my great admiration and appreciation for Senator TED KENNEDY, with whom I have worked diligently on legislation related to mental illness. His support, knowledge, and friendship have been invaluable in our joint fight for better access and opportunities for the millions of Americans who suffer from some form of mental illness. To him I owe a debt of gratitude and am thankful for the opportunity to have worked so closely with him for so many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that approximately 16 percent of adult U.S. jail and prison inmates suffer from mental illness and the numbers are even higher in the juvenile justice system. Many of these individuals are not violent or habitual criminals. Most have been charged or convicted of non-violent crimes that are a direct consequence of not having received needed treatment and supportive services for their mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The presence of defendants with mental illnesses in the criminal justice system imposes substantial costs on that system and can cause significant harm to defendants. In response to this problem, a number of communities around the country are implementing mental health courts, a specialty court model that utilizes a separate docket, coupled with regular judicial supervision, to respond to individuals with mental illnesses who come in contact with the justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many communities are not prepared to meet the comprehensive treatment and needs of individuals with mental illness when they enter the criminal justice system. The bill passing today is intended to help provide resources to help states and counties design and implement collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health structures. The bill reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Grant Program and reauthorizes the Mental Health Courts Program. It creates  a new grant program to help law enforcement identify and respond to incidents involving persons with mental illness and it funds a study and report on the prevalence of mentally ill offenders in the criminal justice system. All of these reforms will help to address this problem from both a public safety and a public health point of view. This will help save taxpayers money, improve public safety, and link individuals with the treatment they need to become productive members of their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, not every crime committed by an individual diagnosed with a mental illness is attributable to their illness or to the failure of public mental health. Mental health courts are not a panacea for addressing the needs of the growing number of people with mental illnesses who come in contact with the criminal justice system. But they should be one part of the solution. Evidence has shown that in communities where mental health and criminal justice interests work collaboratively on solutions  it can make a significant impact in fostering recovery, improving treatment outcomes and decreasing recidivism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my good friends for working with me on this very important issue. I appreciate their commitment to advancing these important programs and I am thankful to be here to see the passage of this legislation that we worked so hard on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, in strongly supporting Senate passage of <bill type="s" number="2304">S. 2304</bill>, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2008. This bicameral, bipartisan legislation demonstrates strong Federal support for helping local communities address the current crisis in which far too many persons with mental illness are subjected to incarceration, not treatment. With  full funding, this proposal has the potential to achieve significant reforms in the criminal justice system's treatment of people diagnosed with mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Domenici for his leadership on this bill and on many other initiatives to improve our Nation's mental health system. I also commend the leadership of Representatives Bobby Scott and Forbes in the House of Representatives on this issue. This important legislation will promote cooperative initiatives that will significantly reduce recidivism and improve treatment outcomes for mentally ill offenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on the most recent studies by the Bureau of Justice, more than half of all prison and jail inmates in 2005 had a mental health problem, including 56 percent of inmates in State prisons, 45 percent of Federal prisoners, and 64 percent of jail inmates. According to a report by the Council of State Governments' Criminal Justice-Mental Health Consensus Project, the rate of mental illness in State prisons and jails is at least three times the rate in the general population, and at least three-quarters  of those incarcerated have a substance abuse disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Far too often, individuals are subjected to the criminal justice system, when what is really needed is treatment and support for mental illness or substance abuse disorders. Families often resort in desperation to the police in order to obtain treatment and assistance for a loved one suffering from an extreme episode of a mental illness. During times of such distress, families feel they have no other alternative because persons with symptoms such as paranoia, exaggerated actions, or impaired  judgment are unable to recognize the need for treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unconscionable, and may well be unconstitutional, for these vulnerable individuals to be further marginalized after they are incarcerated. Too often they are denied even minimal treatment because of inadequate resources. Most mentally ill offenders who come into contact with the criminal justice system are charged with low-level, nonviolent crimes. Once behind bars, they may well face an environment that further exacerbates symptoms of mental illness that might otherwise be manageable with  proper treatment, and they may soon be back in prison as a result of insufficient and inadequate services when they are released.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reauthorizes critical programs to move away from troubled systems that often result in the escalating incarceration of individuals with mental illness. Through this legislation, State and local correctional facilities will be able to create appropriate, cost-effective solutions. In particular, I am very supportive of the crisis intervention teams that many communities have developed to expand cooperation between the mental health system and law enforcement. These teams have been very  effective in enabling officers to spend less time arresting mentally ill individuals and more time directing them toward treatment. I also support the continued expansion of mental health courts, so that defendants can be placed into judicially supervised community-based treatment programs, which often result in better outcomes and reduced recidivism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, we have seen only a fraction of the possible potential of this legislation, because only a small number of communities have been able to benefit from this legislation. Because of limited Federal funding, only 11 percent of applicants have been able to receive one of these grants, even though demand for them is high. No magic solution will solve the problems faced by communities across America. But this  bill will effectively address local needs  by fostering greater cooperation between law enforcement and mental health providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, members of State and local law enforcement need access to training and other alternatives to improve safety and responsiveness. It reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment Program and maintains its authorized funding at $50 million a year. The legislation also authorizes grants to States and local governments to train law enforcement personnel on procedures to identify and respond more appropriately to persons with mental illness, and develop specialized receiving centers  to assess individuals in custody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The broad support for this legislation includes the Council of State Governments, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Sheriffs Association, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Campaign for Mental Health Reform and Mental Health America. These organizations understand it will provide much needed assistance to help solve this complex problem. Courts, law enforcement,  corrections and mental health communities have all come together in support of this legislation, and Congress is right to respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals and their loved ones struggle with countless challenges and barriers during a mental health crisis. With this bill, Congress will be providing significant new support for needed cooperative efforts between law enforcement and mental health experts. I am pleased that the Senate supports this legislation, and I am optimistic it will be enacted before the end of this current session of Congress.</paragraph>
