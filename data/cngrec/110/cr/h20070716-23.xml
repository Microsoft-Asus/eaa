    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank our colleague, Congresswoman Thelma Drake, for sponsoring this important resolution and for her leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-five years ago, William and Kathleen Magee of Virginia traveled with other medical professionals to the Philippines to treat children with facial deformities. Little did they know it was a trip that would change their lives and the lives of thousands of children around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by the Filipino children, the Magees decided to start their own organization designed specifically to address cleft palates and cleft lips in countries where medical care leaves those afflicted with few options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They called it Operation Smile, and the Magees were the perfect couple to start it. William is a plastic surgeon, and Kathleen is a nurse and social worker. Since 1982, operating out of their headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, they have led a dedicated coalition of medical services workers to address facial deformities around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from appearance and comfort level, these are serious conditions that can cause problems with feeding and speech, as well as ear disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 25 years, Operation Smile has provided corrective reconstructive surgery to some 100,000 children and young adults in 25 countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Smile adeptly recognizes the differences in these countries and brings together medical professionals to tailor their care depending on the setting. The organization coordinates training activities, as well as fellowships and professorships, to further both its own mission and the medical system in these countries overall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Smile provides a network of resources to assist families in the United States with children born with facial deformities. It runs an annual international student leadership conference and student leadership program, and it trains surgeons in certain advanced skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can all learn from Operation Smile and the model it provides to medical professionals and organizations around the world, and we can all learn from the Magees that public service can go far beyond one's chosen profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor Operation Smile and William and Kathleen  Magee on the 25th anniversary of their organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="208">H. Res. 208</bill>, which recognizes the 25th anniversary of the founding of Operation Smile, a private nonprofit founded by Dr. and Mrs. William Magee of Virginia in 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the volunteers for Operation Smile provide reconstructive surgery and other health care to needy children in the United States, as well as in developing countries. They particularly help children with a cleft lip or cleft palate, congenital birth defects that occur as frequently as one in every 600 births.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clefts can cause multiple physical and mental health problems for children and adults, including feeding and speech difficulties, ear infections that can lead to deafness, and low self-esteem, as well as alienation from others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children worldwide need not, and must not, suffer from these health problems simply because they were born with clefts. Surgery in infancy, adolescence or young adulthood can correct clefts and avert resulting medical and psychological difficulties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, many families who seek medical care and surgery for children born with clefts are turned away, both in the United States and abroad, due to lack of funds or shortages of medically trained professionals who can provide the care that these children urgently need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the outstanding medical professionals at Operation Smile have, for a quarter of a century, volunteered their time and effort to help save these children and their families. They have provided free reconstructive surgeries to over 100,000 children and young adults in this country and worldwide. They educate and train thousands of health care professionals across the globe. Just as importantly, they are developing future generations of volunteers for this noble cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young men and women at more than 450 Operation Smile student associations in the United States and abroad are fund-raising, building awareness and encouraging their fellow students to take charge, to lead and to volunteer their time to help others. In all of these ways, these volunteers demonstrate the potential that volunteers and nonprofits have to change lives, to tackle global problems and to significantly improve the world around them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of their 25 years of service, many children and young adults who were born with cleft lip or palate can look at themselves in the mirror with pride, and so can volunteers at Operation Smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution, offered by my good friend and colleague from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) sends the right message by recognizing and encouraging outstanding volunteers and achievements in the private and the nonprofit sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Madam Speaker, I urge the House to adopt this resolution, <bill type="hr" number="208">H. Res. 208</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to commend the efforts of Operation Smile during their 25 years of service to the United States and to the world. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman DRAKE, for sponsoring this resolution and bringing it to the floor. As we both represent the city of Norfolk, VA, the home of Operation Smile, I would just like to say a few words about Operation Smile and its efforts to help children  around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Operation Smile has accomplished since its inception is truly remarkable. Since its first mission in the Philippines in 1982, Operation Smile volunteers have treated more than 100,000 children and young adults and have trained thousands of health professionals around the world. In addition, through pure determination, Operation Smile has built bridges and built trust. As a result, it has created a presence, earned the respect of governments and ministries of health, and united cultures in  over 25 developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Smile consists of a diverse group of volunteers from various countries and cultures, who come together with the common goal of repairing childhood facial deformities. Through these missions, the strongest bonds of friendships are forged as people who have very little in common work together to change a life. Operation Smile has demonstrated an ability to find working partnerships amid unstable and controversial conditions. Through diplomacy and leadership, coupled with medical aid and  technology, it is able to heal and inspire cross-cultural cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While promoting medical diplomacy, Operation Smile continues to cross borders, bridge cultural and ethnic divides, and encourage collaboration and commitment. Its success has been astounding and as a result, Operation Smile has become the largest volunteer charity of its kind. Its efforts go beyond children and their families--Operation Smile changes communities, students, medical professionals, and healthcare systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this past year, Operation Smile traveled to Jordan on two separate occasions in order to provide life-changing surgeries to 138 Iraqi children who were transported to Amman from Baghdad, and it worked with the Mercy ships to treat 54 children in Bangladesh. These missions consisted of volunteers from over a dozen countries who worked together side by side to help these children. In this time of war, the volunteers of Operation Smile managed to bring a bright light to the lives of these children  that will last a lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the war against terrorism, hatred of Americans by other populations is a significant problem. The work of Operation Smile is immeasurable in developing good will to counteract that hatred. The doctors and other volunteers who work with Operation Smile and the children who have been helped by Operation Smile will serve as perpetual evidence of our good will and the best America has to offer. I cannot think of better ambassadors for the United States than the founders of Operation Smile, Dr.  Bill and Kathleen Magee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982, Bill and Kathleen saw a need both abroad and here at home to help children with deformities live a better and happier life. Because of their diligence, and that of the many volunteers and donors that have worked with Operation Smile over the past 25 years, Operation Smile has not only created smiles, but has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to once again commend Operation Smile on the occasion of their 25th anniversary, and I wish them continued success bringing smiles to the faces of children and families worldwide.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 25th Anniversary of Operation Smile, a worldwide children's medical charity that repairs cleft lips and cleft palates for children and young adults in developing countries. Operation Smile, which is headquartered in Norfolk, VA, was founded by Dr. William Magee, Jr., a plastic surgeon, and his wife, Kathleen, a nurse and clinical social worker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982, the Magees traveled to the Philippines with a group of medical volunteers to repair children's cleft lips and cleft palates. While many children were treated, the inundated volunteers, lacking in resources and manpower, were forced to turn away the majority of those who sought help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Magees were heartbroken to see such an overwhelming need. Yet, instead of being discouraged, the Magees were inspired by their experience. As they prepared to leave the Philippines the Magees made a promise to return to the Philippines to help more children and Operation Smile was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Magees returned to Norfolk and began to solicit the donations of surgical equipment and supplies, began grassroots fundraising, and assembled a volunteer team of doctors, nurses and technicians. Just as they promised, the Magees returned to the Philippines to treat even more patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since those humble beginnings in 1982, Operation Smile has grown into a worldwide children's medical charity whose network of medical volunteers are dedicated to helping improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Operation Smile has helped more than 100,000 children and young adults in 30 developing countries overcome their physical irregularities. The organization now operates one of the world's largest volunteer networks, utilizing more than 5,000 medical and non-medical  professionals around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During their medical missions, credentialed medical professionals volunteer to repair facial deformities while building public and private partnerships that advocate for sustainable healthcare systems for children and families. Furthermore, Operation Smile trains and educates local medical professionals and leaves behind necessary equipment to lay the groundwork for long-term self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Magees for their passion to improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Through Operation Smile, their efforts over the past 25 years have offered new life and new hope to those suffering from facial deformities and their families. In recognition of Operation Smile's 25th Anniversary, I am truly honored to commend their noble work here on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
