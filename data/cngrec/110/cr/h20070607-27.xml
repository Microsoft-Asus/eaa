    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Walk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the year, kidney walks will be held nationwide. Specifically, in my congressional district, a kidney walk will be held on June 9, this Saturday, at Eldridge park in Elmira, New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 20 million Americans; and, tragically, 80,000 people die each year from the disease. Additionally, in 2006, 17,000 kidney transplants were performed, yet more than 70,000 people are on the national waiting list for a kidney transplant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the kidney walk is to encourage Americans to educate themselves about early detection and prevention of kidney disease and to promote awareness of organ donation. The walks are for a good and a very important cause, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting them.</paragraph>
