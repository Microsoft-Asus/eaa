    <paragraph>Mr. President, this week Wisconsin is honored to host more than 600 veterans and athletes for the National Veterans Wheelchair Games in Milwaukee. At the largest annual wheelchair sports event in the world, hundreds of veterans who made tremendous sacrifices for our Nation will demonstrate not only their remarkable athletic abilities but also their unmatched courage and determination in the face of adversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World-class wheelchair athletes and newly disabled veterans will join together in Milwaukee for 17 competitive events and 2 exhibition events. The National Veterans Wheelchair Games is a great sporting event, and it is also a chance for athletes to develop lasting friendships with other veterans who have faced and overcome similar obstacles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee and the Wisconsin Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America for hosting the games, as well as the VA officials and volunteers who helped to make these games a reality. More than 3400 Wisconsinites are showing their support by volunteering during the games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage these athletes and their families to explore their unique and dynamic host city. I hope everyone has the opportunity to experience Milwaukee's wonderful lakefront and sample the outstanding food and drink that Milwaukee is known for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Milwaukee will give a warm welcome to all the competitors and visitors who have come to the city for this week's games. Their competitive spirit and the incredible sacrifices they have made bravely serving our Nation are an inspiration to us all. I hope everyone enjoys what is sure to be an exciting and memorable week.</paragraph>
