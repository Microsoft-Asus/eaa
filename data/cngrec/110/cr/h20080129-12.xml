  <speaking speaker="400657" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the bipartisan economic stimulus plan that will help strengthen our Nation's economy and help millions of American taxpayers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my congressional district, the median household income is $36,000, and those families face rising prices in utilities, food, and health insurance, which stretch their monthly budgets to nearly the breaking point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, nearly 39 percent of these households are headed by single mothers living below the poverty level, who struggle to feed and clothe their children with limited budgets, as they are the sole earners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stimulus package will provide at least $900 to single mothers and their families, which helps alleviate their burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support the bipartisan economic stimulus plan, and I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us today in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
