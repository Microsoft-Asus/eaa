    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of World Sight Day and the tireless leadership of organizations like the Christian Blind Mission headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christian Blind Mission is an international aid organization that specializes in improving the quality of life for the blind in the world's poorest countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, organizations like Christian Blind Mission recognize World Sight Day as a time to focus global attention on vision and blindness. This year, World Sight Day will take place tomorrow, October 11, and will emphasize the tragedy of blindness in children. There are an estimated 1.4 million blind children in the world, the majority of whom live in Third World countries. Remarkably, 75 percent of all major blinding conditions are preventable or curable, and the Christian Blind Mission has  taken the lead in performing over one-half million cataract surgeries and distributing over one-half million tubes of tetracycline eye ointment to combat trachoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, it's an honor to recognize Christian Blind Mission-USA for their humanitarian efforts worldwide. Every day, thousands of children receive the gift of sight because of the hard work and initiative that organizations like the Christian Blind Mission provide.</paragraph>
