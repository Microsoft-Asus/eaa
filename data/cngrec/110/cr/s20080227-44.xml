  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 462--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2008 AS &quot;NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS WEEK&quot;">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to talk about an important resolution I am submitting. It is the asbestos awareness week resolution. This resolution has passed the Senate for 3 years, and I am pleased to submit it again this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very deeply personal issue for me. About 8 years ago, I was in Libby, MT, in the living room of Les Skramstad, and there were several people in the room who were suffering from asbestos-related diseases. This was in Libby. Since then, about 200 people have died of asbestos-related diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Les Skramstad, whom I met that day about 8 or 9 years ago, was dying from mesothelioma. He looked at me and said: As a U.S. Senator, I expect you do something to help us in Libby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: You bet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He looked me straight in the eye, and because he has been around a little bit, he said: Senator, I am going to be watching you to make sure that is not just an idle promise. I will be watching you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Boy, I got the message loudly and clearly. I decided right then at that moment that I need to do all I can to help make sure that people in Libby, MT, get justice. As I said, over 200 people died since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an employee of a W.R. Grace mine. W.R. Grace clearly knew it was poisoning people in Libby, MT, in its mine there. It did not admit it. There is a criminal case going on right now against the officers of W.R. Grace claiming that they did know what they were doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asbestos from this mine is called tremolite. It is not the ordinary crystal asbestos. This is tremolite asbestos, which is much more pernicious. It gets more deeply embedded in your lungs, more angles to the dust that gets into your lungs. It is harder to detect. Sometimes the latency period can be from 20 to 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Les would come home all dusty from the mine, and he would go home and embrace his wife, and his kids would jump into his lap. Guess what. Les is now dead. He died last month from mesothelioma. Les's wife is dying from asbestos-related diseases. Three of his four children are now dying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the dust, the asbestos dust that is in Libby, MT. This stuff was used on playgrounds. It was used on golf courses. It was used for insulation in attics in homes. People have died and are dying. We are doing all we can to address this, and we are trying to get them proper medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a clinic called the CARD Clinic in Libby which is doing a really good job in screening people, trying to find out who has it and who doesn't. Again, it is very hard to find. You need special techniques. We had to change the disability laws in America because--not change but point out to the Social Security Administration that this is a different kind of asbestos, it is not ordinary asbestos, and then decide whether to grant disability payments. They were looking at ordinary asbestos.  They didn't know about this asbestos. They didn't know about tremolite asbestos. Finally, people in Montana are getting disability benefits because of the asbestos diseases they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am very proud to submit this resolution. As I said, I have been doing this for several years, and we are making this National Asbestos Recognition Week in April, the first week in April. I believe it is so important to highlight this dread disease so we can stamp out the scourge and, in my view, finally banish asbestos. If we can accomplish that, then in some small way we have vindicated the people of Libby, MT.</paragraph>
