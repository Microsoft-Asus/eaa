    <bill type="sr" number="660">S. Res. 660</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas, since 2003, the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan has killed at least 300,000 people and displaced more than 2,500,000, according to the United Nations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on July 22, 2004, the Senate declared, "the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide", and on September 9, 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell testified before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that "genocide has occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur" and "the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1556, imposing an arms embargo on non-governmental belligerents in Darfur, requiring "all states [to] take the necessary measures to prevent the sale or supply . . . of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts for the aforementioned" to those belligerents;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution  1591, extending the embargo imposed by Security Council Resolution 1556 to apply to the Government of Sudan, establishing a sanctions committee to monitor the arms embargo, and prohibiting the Government of Sudan from moving arms into Darfur except with the advance approval of that committee;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591 together impose on all United Nations member states the obligation not to sell or supply arms to any belligerent operating in Darfur, including the Sudanese military, and obligate the Government of Sudan not to transfer any arms to Darfur without the approval of the sanctions committee;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in September 2006, the Panel of Experts on the Sudan, established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1591, reported to the United Nations Security Council that a senior official of the Government of Sudan told the Panel that "the Government had a sovereign right to transfer weapons and additional military personnel into Darfur without obtaining the specific permission of the Security Council";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Panel of Experts on the Sudan also concluded that "the Government of the Sudan continues to violate the arms embargo by transferring equipment and related weapons into Darfur" and that "[t]he Government of the Sudan remains adamant that it has the right to transfer troops and equipment into Darfur without reference to the sanctions Committee" established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1591;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in October 2007, the Panel of Experts on the Sudan reported numerous instances in which the Government of Sudan had transferred arms to Darfur without seeking the approval of the sanctions committee;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, according to a May 2007 report by Amnesty International, weapons transferred to Sudan from China and Russia are used extensively in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, according to a July 2008 report by the British Broadcasting Corporation, weapons have been transferred to Darfur from China since the arms embargo imposed by Security Council Resolution 1591 became effective;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, at the insistence of the Governments of China and Russia, arms sales to the Government of Sudan were excluded from the arms embargo imposed by Security Council Resolution 1556, though not from Security Council Resolution 1591, passed 8 months later; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, according to data provided by the Government of Sudan to the United Nations, arms sales from China to the Government of Sudan have increased dramatically since the late 1990s, and from 2004 through 2006, China supplied approximately 90 percent of small arms imported into Sudan: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the United States should seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Darfur and should continue to pursue a political solution as well as the immediate and unfettered deployment of the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur, without regard to the country of origin of those forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the United States supports United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005), imposing an arms embargo on all belligerents in Darfur, and supports consistent enforcement of the embargo;</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) taken together, the obligation imposed by the United Nations on all member states to "take the necessary measures to prevent the sale or supply" of arms to belligerents operating in Darfur, the well-documented existence of arms in Darfur that were transferred from China and Russia, and the insistence of the Government of Sudan that it will not abide by the embargo, lead to the conclusion that continued sale of arms to Sudan under these circumstances violates the United Nations arms embargo  imposed by Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) all United Nations member states should immediately cease all arms sales to the Government of Sudan, until the conflict in Darfur, and the armed conflict related to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, have been peacefully resolved; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations should use the voice and vote of the United States in the United Nations Security Council to seek an expansion of the arms embargo imposed by Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591 to cover all of Sudan, with an appropriate exception for non-lethal assistance to the Government of Southern Sudan.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution calling for a stop to the illegal flow of arms into Sudan and an expansion of the United Nations embargo on arms sales to Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy we have a number of cosponsors of this legislation--as a matter of fact, Senators Inhofe, Brownback, Casey, Clinton, Dole, Durbin, Feingold, Hatch, Isakson, Kerry, Lieberman, Martinez, Menendez, Snowe, and Boxer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can see with Senators spanning the breadth and depth of the Senate, they are recognizing this is one of the most important issues facing planet Earth at this time in trying to stop the genocide in Darfur. Last July 14, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague requested a warrant for the arrest of Sudan's President Bashir on the charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In part, it was because of his arming the jingaweit militias in Darfur. Our colleagues certainly are urging the prosecution of Bashir for these crimes. But it is now time for the international community and the Congress to take further action in order to prevent the continued export of arms to the regime, the Sudan regime in Khartoum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is a call to action to stop the steady stream of arms going from countries such as China and Russia into Darfur. The loopholes in the current UN arms regime are recognized as the main cause for the continued violence and the killings there. Two UN arms embargoes are currently in place prohibiting the Government of Sudan from moving arms into Darfur except with the advance approval of the UN monitoring body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The embargoes also require foreign nations to take measures to ensure they do not militarily assist anyone in the conflict in Darfur. Yet those embargoes are impossible to enforce since the Government of Sudan can still receive as many weapons as it wants, as long as the government in Khartoum promises that the arms are not going to be used in Darfur, which, of course, it makes those promises and then completely ignores them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Sudan's main weapons suppliers, China and Russia, they turn a blind eye to the fact that the weapons they sold are being used to kill the innocent civilians in Darfur, and the weapons continue to flow into the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, remember, earlier in the year, China had shipped a huge weapons cache to the regime in Zimbabwe. But fortunately the ship was turned away by the dockworkers in South Africa. In the case of Sudan, however, the Chinese arms reached their final destination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the United Nations, China supplies approximately 90 percent of Sudan's imports of small arms today. Expanding the present embargo would help us prohibit China and Russia from selling to Sudan regardless of where those arms were used in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the October 2007 report, the U.N. panel of experts cited numerous instances in which the Government of Sudan had egregiously violated the obligations under international law. Likewise, Amnesty International has reported that Chinese and Russian weapons are used extensively in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the BBC aired a long expose on the arms flow into Sudan, and that BBC expose proved that Chinese weapons have been transferred to Darfur since the arms embargo was imposed by the United Nations resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So how much more proof do we need? I tried to go to the Sudan last year, but the Government of Sudan denied me a visa. So I had to go in through the back door by going into Chad and going to the border there. As I traveled along that border of Chad and the Sudan, I saw there the squalid refugee camps where 400,000 of those people who had fled Darfur had taken refuge from the killings and the violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, the killings and the violence did not stop once they were in the refugee camps in Chad. Since 2003, the conflict in Darfur has killed at least an unbelievable 300,000 people, and it has displaced more than 2.5 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They know the horrors of war, hunger, and, unfortunately the women know the horrors of rape. And the attacks on the refugee camps continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, the men in the refugee camps make the women go out to collect the firewood. Anytime they go outside of the perimeter of the refugee camp, they are subject to being attacked and raped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governments, religious leaders, human rights activists, and nongovernmental organizations have issued calls to end the genocide. The people of Darfur, nevertheless, remain vulnerable to daily attacks by these militias, armed with Chinese and Russian firearms, and they continue to suffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been putting the spotlight on Darfur for several years now and nothing gets done. The Government of Sudan makes promises, the United Nations tries to do things, and nothing gets done. Resolutions and envoys have  thus far failed to stop countries from funneling the arms into Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly, we now have another opportunity to name and shame the perpetrators and to halt the immoral export of weapons to the killing fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this resolution is about. It pledges to continue United States support for a political solution in Darfur, and it calls for the immediate and unfettered deployment of a United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force, without regard to the country of origin of those forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It calls for the immediate end of arms sales to the Government of Sudan from all U.N. member states. That will continue until the conflict in Darfur has been resolved. This resolution calls for the use of the voice and vote of the United States in the Security Council in order to expand that embargo to cover all of the arms going into the Sudan except for an appropriate exception for the nonlethal assistance to the Government of southern Sudan. At this upcoming 63rd U.N. General Assembly, when  it opens next week, the U.S. must support this expanded embargo that will try to bring some sense into the madness that is over there. If the U.N. Security Council were to strengthen the embargo regime, it would send a strong signal to the Sudanese Government that their support in the international community is shifting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is going to be this Senator's great privilege, as one of two Senators representing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to represent the Senate at the United Nations General Assembly. I plan to bring up this issue over and over again to the U.N. delegates I meet. I hope the Senate will see fit to support this effort by passing this resolution.</paragraph>
