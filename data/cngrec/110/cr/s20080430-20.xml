  <narrative>HONORING TRANS-TECH INDUSTRIES -- (Senate - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3590">S3590</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commend the immeasurable contributions of a small Maine company both to its industry and community. Trans-Tech Industries is an innovative manufacturer of aluminum tanks and trailers which are used to transport fuel and petroleum products. In addition to leading its field, Trans-Tech has given back to the city of Brewer, ME, in countless ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trans-Tech is a shining model for companies seeking to compete in the demanding global marketplace. Founded in 1984, the company set out with a simple goal: strengthen existing models of aluminum tanks to become safer and more convenient for the operator. Trans-Tech originally began operations in a converted storage unit in the seaside town of Southwest Harbor. During its early years, Trans-Tech manufactured tanks and trailers as well as aluminum boats. But company president Ken Peters found  it difficult to produce the number of tanks for which he had hoped, and he continually increased efforts to make more tanks. In 1999, Trans-Tech finally moved to a location in Brewer's East-West Industrial Park that better suited the company's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since relocating to Brewer, Trans-Tech's tank production has soared. The company presently makes between 400 and 500 tanks each year, as opposed to the less than 100 it previously produced, and revenues have increased threefold. Moreover, the company continues to improve and expand. Besides its state-of-the-art 43,000 square foot production facility, Trans-Tech added an adjacent 7,200 square foot building in 2004, allowing it to focus on the manufacturing of specialty trailers. Trans-Tech was  additionally able to realize its goal of developing aircraft refuelers that range from 1,000 to 10,000 gallons each which are now in use at airports across the country, showing how Trans-Tech has made the most of its new opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Trans-Tech certainly produces high quality tanks and trailers, the firm and its over 60 employees are also a good neighbor, donating time and resources to many area organizations and charities. Trans-Tech's commitment to the community is visible with its assistance to The Salvation Army; the company's sponsoring a youth hockey team; and its major participation in the Brewer Days and Brewer Winterfest, two well-attended annual community events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Trans-Tech's most recognizable efforts is its involvement with the Bangor Area Homeless Shelter. Mr. Peters serves on the shelter's board of directors, and he and Trans-Tech constantly provide the shelter with needed supplies such as furniture and food. They even donated a new air conditioner for the hot summer months. Mr. Peters also serves as a board member on the Brewer Economic Development Corporation and he is a founding member of the Penobscot Landing Committee, which is aimed at  revitalizing the historic Brewer waterfront. He is also the 2008 recipient of the Governor's Service Award as chosen by the Maine Commission for Community Service, a fitting acknowledgement of the devotion he and Trans-Tech have shown to improving the well-being of Brewer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through its unyielding pledge to both business and community, Trans-Tech sets a high bar for companies seeking to succeed in all facets. Ken Peters inspires his employees, and they in turn help make Brewer a better community in which to live. He also gives back to his employees in numerous ways, including providing them with a raise to help them manage rising gas prices. The firm's magnanimous spirit truly flows from the top, and it is something to be celebrated. I congratulate Trans-Tech Industries  on all it does, and wish the company well in the future.</paragraph>
