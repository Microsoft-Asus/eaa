    <paragraph>Mr. President, a few weeks ago, Congress approved legislation that would have changed the course of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. I say occupation because, frankly, that is what this is. Our troops won the battle they were sent to fight. The dictator Saddam Hussein is deposed and executed. His rotten government is no more, replaced with a democratically elected Parliament, President, and Prime Minister. We all are cheered at the skill of our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, sadly, this President has not done justice by our brave troops. The dreadful management of this occupation has resulted in chaos. Iraq is at war with itself and our troops are caught in the middle. That is why this Congress established a new direction for bringing our troops home from this misbegotten occupation. The bill the President vetoed would have refocused our military, not on the civil war in Iraq but, rather, on Osama bin Laden and his base of operations. It is time for the President  to take off his blinders and uncover his ears. White House obstinacy cannot continue to drive our military plans in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this supplemental funding legislation we begin to shift the responsibility for Iraq's future off the shoulders of our military, and onto the shoulders of the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people. The White House wanted a blank check for the President's mangled occupation of Iraq. We are not going to sign on that dotted line--not now, not ever. The legislation that is before the Senate today is a step toward that goal. It is not a giant leap, but it is progress. And it is only a first step.  In a few weeks, this Senate is expected to focus on the Defense Department authorization bill. I shall press for a vote on the proposal Senator Clinton and I have outlined in the authorization for the Iraq war and to give Congress a chance, just</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July we will turn our attention to the Pentagon's fiscal 2008 funding request, and in September we will consider the $145 billion war funding request for the next fiscal year. Each of these bills is an opportunity to shape the future course of the mission in Iraq. Clearly, Congress is not turning from the debate on Iraq. On the contrary, we are just beginning this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all committed to protecting our men and women in uniform. This legislation provides the funding to do just that. We ensure $3 billion for the purchase of mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles. The 2,000 additional advanced armored vehicles that will be built with these funds will help to save the lives of American soldiers and American marines as they travel the lonely streets of Baghdad--the lonely streets of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If our soldiers are injured in battle, this legislation ensures they will receive high-quality health care when they come home. The fiasco at Walter Reed should be seared into our national consciousness. That is why this legislation provides $4.8 billion to ensure that troops and veterans receive the health care they have earned with their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks ago, we watched Kansas families try to put their lives back together after deadly tornadoes ripped through their homes. The Kansas Governor pointed out that her State's National Guard equipment was parked in Iraq and not at home, slowing cleanup and recovery efforts. Other States faced the potential for the exact same problem. This supplemental bill provides $1 billion--that is 1 dollar for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--$1 billion for the National Guard and reserve to  replace the trucks and heavy equipment that Guard units have been directed to leave in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again today President Bush warned of terrorist attacks on American soil. He talks a great deal about the threats of such attacks, but very seldom does he provide resources to protect the country. If the President's warnings are accurate, the $1 billion contained in this bill should help to save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We include funds for port security and for mass transit security, for explosive detection equipment at airports, and for several initiatives in the 9/11 bill that recently passed the Senate, including a more aggressive screening of cargo on passenger airlines. We will not--no, we will not--close our eyes to the huge gaps in our protections at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also work to heal the devastated communities still struggling to recover from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. To this day, mangled trash heaps stand where homes and families once lived. This White House, the Bush White House, sends billions of dollars to rebuild Baghdad but ignores the overwhelming needs in New Orleans, Slidell, Biloxi, and so many other places at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill invests $6.4 billion--that is $6.40 for every minute since Jesus was born--this bill invests $6.4 billion to rebuild the gulf coast communities and to restore the vibrance of this proud region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close, and I thank my ranking member, Senator THAD COCHRAN, for his help. I thank Representative DAVE OBEY, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the Senate leaders, Senator HARRY REID and Senator MITCH MCCONNELL. I thank the Appropriations Committee staff: staff director, Charles Kieffer; Republican staff director, Bruce Evans; and our subcommittee and professional staff members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate, I deeply appreciate the long hours they have worked--yes, long hours they have worked to craft the supplemental legislation. I urge Senators, all Senators on both sides of the aisle, to support this legislation. It is the product of bipartisan negotiations. That is right, isn't it, THAD?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to talk first about the process and then the substance of this legislation. As everybody knows, we will soon be considering the war supplemental bill entitled "The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That title is very important. As the title says, the legislation is an appropriations bill. The title refers to troop readiness. There is finally, after several months of legislative wrangling, funding for the troops that the President can sign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The title refers to veterans care. There is funding for that. The title refers to Katrina recovery. There are funds for Hurricane Katrina damage. The title also refers to Iraq accountability. There is language finally in the form acceptable to the President so that he can sign it dealing with benchmarks on our mission in Iraq and the role of the Iraqi Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The title of the bill, however, does not refer to any matters within the jurisdiction of a committee I am very familiar with, the Finance Committee. But take a look and you will find three categories of Finance Committee matters: One, the small business tax relief package; two, the so-called pension technicals; and, three, Medicaid and SCHIP provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why does it matter whether these policy provisions travel in a tax-writing committee bill or an appropriations bill? It matters for several reasons. I had the pleasure of serving on both the Finance Committee, and for a very short period of time during my career in the Senate, on the Appropriations Committee. They are the money committees of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Appropriations bills, by and large, spend money. That is not entitlements, that is the set-asides in the budget. Finance Committee bills, on the other hand, raise revenue and deal with most of the health and welfare entitlement spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both the Appropriations and Finance Committees have very strong constitutional traditions, expertise in the complex subject matter, and seasoned memberships motivated and dedicated to service of the respective committees. All you have to do is look at the careers of Chairman Byrd, the ranking member, or Senator Baucus, to know that they dedicate themselves to these two great money committees of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when policy issues are processed outside of the Appropriations or outside the Finance Committee, necessary care, expertise, and experience is lost. When I was chairman, I took great pains to avoid taking on appropriations matters. More often than not, policy made outside of either of these committee jurisdictions will, it seems, somehow need to be corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another reason it matters; that is, policy made through the committee process is very transparent, and that is what American Government and the Congress is all about, transparency--the public business to be done publicly. The committee's role is to air and carefully consider proposals in the areas of committee jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are really talking about transparency. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. When the committee process is  end-run, as I will demonstrate in part of this bill, there is usually no positive reason. Usually the reason is expediency on the part of people, maybe even beyond the control of the committee chairman, and I would suggest legislative leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has happened not just now, it has happened under Republicans and under Democrats. But I am pleased to say it has been effectively very rare over the last few years. Skipping the committee process on new proposals was the exception rather than the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, now, with respect to the critical pieces of Finance Committee jurisdiction, it looks as if leadership prefers to skip the committee, after I have been told privately and publicly so many times all of the work is going to be done through the committee. So I am hoping that what I am going to complain about is pretty much a temporary pattern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To sum it up, the people's business should be done in committees in a transparent way so the people of this country know what is going on. Committee process means sunshine. I think the committee process was abused on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the conference process was also abused. We never even went through the trappings of the committee process. We have an amended House bill that because of the imperative of an acceptable war funding package has the force of a conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How was the process abused? Just take a look at the bill, and you will find a patchwork of unconnected provisions in the Finance Committee jurisdiction that is not even mentioned in the title. Aside from a small business tax relief provision, no real back-and-forth discussion occurred on these matters, either in the Finance Committee or in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the small business tax relief provisions, the House and Senate Democratic leadership set an arbitrary ceiling that constrained our outstanding chairman, Senator Baucus, from reaching a bipartisan agreement which is so much in the tradition of how Senator Baucus and I work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, Republicans opened the door to a conference agreement without receiving assurances of a fair deal. I don't think we got a fair deal. Once Republicans opened the door to the conference, the door was effectively shut on full and meaningful participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in the past, Republican leadership did similar things, and Democrats cried foul. I am proud to say that on most, not all, Finance Committee conferences, the Senate Democrats were represented and present for final conference agreements. After crying foul about some conference processes, the Senate Democratic leadership insisted in previous years on preconference agreements before letting Republicans go to conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I feared earlier in the year, the Senate Republican leadership will have to similarly insist on assurances before conferences are convened. This supplemental and its vetoed predecessor made the case that the conference process can't be trusted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Republicans have no recourse other than to insist on preconference agreements, as we can learn from the Democratic minority of the previous 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to turn to the substance of three categories of the Finance Committee matters that were inserted in the process, after spending my previous minutes on that process. Now to the substance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first matter deals with the small business tax relief package that traveled with a minimum wage increase. The deal in the conference is basically the same deal presented by the Democratic negotiators on the last appropriations bill. It favors the House position in number and composition of that package, practically ignoring the great work that Senator Baucus and I did on these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From a small business standpoint, the House bill was a peanut shell. The  Senate bill was real peanuts. Real peanuts--still not enough from my perspective but more, much more than what the House has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see here, I have got Mr. Peanut up here to demonstrate the Senate bill, the House bill, and the conference report. From a small business standpoint, then, I want to repeat: The House bill was a peanut shell. The Senate bill was real peanuts. It is a missed opportunity because a conference agreement is a single, shriveled peanut, not helping small business the way small business ought to have been helped to offset the negative impacts on small business of a minimum wage tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could have, in fact, provided small business with meaningful tax relief that is contemporaneous with the effects of the minimum wage hike that I say, and I think economists agree, are negative toward small business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart shows Mr. Peanut. It shows this bill at each of its stages--a peanut, a peanut shell, and shriveled peanut. What we are going to be voting on will be that shriveled peanut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another matter that bothers me and this is the so-called pension technical corrections. What is a technical correction, one might ask. Technical corrections measures are routine for major tax bills. Last year's landmark bipartisan pension reform bill certainly can be described as a major tax bill. It contained the most significant retirement security policy changes within a generation. There are proposals necessary to ensure that the provisions of the pension reform bill are working  consistently within congressional intent and to provide clerical corrections. That is what technical corrections means. Because these measures carry out congressional intent, no revenue gain or loss is scored by the Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Technical corrections is derived from a deliberative and consultative process among the congressional as well as administration tax staffs, where there is a great deal of expertise. That means the Republican as well as the Democratic staffs, regardless of who is in the majority or minority of both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, are involved, as well as Treasury Department personnel, whether we have a Republican or Democratic President. All of this work is  performed with the participation and guidance of the nonpartisan professional staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. A technical enters the list only if all staffs agree it is appropriate. Any one segment I have listed can veto it. That is why we know it is nonpartisan. That is why we know it is technical. That is why we know it is not a substantive change in law. If it were, it would not be technical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pension provisions in this bill, the one we will be voting on in a little while, represent then forgetting this process so you know things are done right. It represents a cherry-picking of some, not all, of the technical corrections that these professional people, in a nonpartisan way, are currently trying to put together with a bill that will come up later on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there are pension provisions included in this bill that are called technical but are of great substance and are not then technical. Some of these proposals are even controversial. I have reviewed legislative history over the last 15-plus years, and that history informs me that this may be an unprecedented treatment of technical corrections. Techincals were processed on a 2000 year bill that was not a tax-writing committee bill, but that package was a consensus package. All the committees  and the administration had signed off that year, 7 years ago. In other instances, technicals were processed on tax-writing committee vehicles. In all these instances, the packages represented an agreement between all the tax-writing committees, Republican and Democratic, and the Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, there are four committees involved, the two tax-writing committees and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, what we call the HELP Committee, and the House Education and Labor Committee. To illustrate the controversy over the pensions technical package, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of a letter from HELP Committee Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi. The letter lays out their objections to the House technical  process. I also ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter I wrote regarding the Finance Committee's jurisdiction be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, the Republicans now know that the conference process and the committee process will not be respected. We are doing things of a substantive nature. We are doing things for which there is a process to make sure that the term "technical" is abided by. That process that worked so perfectly is ignored. So if the committee process will not be respected, we have to do things to make sure that it is. In the future, we will need to protect the committee and the conference  process, and we will need to do some preconferencing agreements as we ought to have learned from now what is the majority, the Democrats, when they were in the minority, that they got Republicans to agree to. It seems to me that is legitimate. It may not be exactly the way it ought to work, but it is something we have to do to make sure these things don't happen again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, history has proven it was a mistake to give this President the power to go to Iraq, and I believe history will prove it is a mistake to give him the open-ended power that this supplemental bill leaves in his hands. This war is not what this President says it is. I believe we have an obligation not to vote for the continuation of a policy that empowers the President to simply continue the war at his discretion. I have listened to some of my colleagues and others who have  suggested that this bill will somehow change the course. I have to respectfully disagree. This bill does not provide a strategy worthy of our soldiers' sacrifice. Instead it permits more of the same, a strategy that relies on sending American troops into the alleys and back roads of Iraq to referee a deadly civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of the same misguided strategy, I believe we had an opportunity. While I understand the votes and I understand the threat of veto, and I am not new to this process, I still believe we had an opportunity to elicit a legitimate, fundamental change and some commitments from this administration with respect to the way in which we would hold Iraqis accountable and the way in which this administration itself would be held accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say with all due respect, that is what the American people voted for in November 2006. That is what they have a right to expect from this Congress. The fact is, we could show our support for our troops in many different ways in this legislation. I don't believe the only way to show that support is by letting the President have full discretion to continue to do what the President has been doing for these last years. I believe the way you do it is by requiring--and setting up real measurements  with real consequences--the Iraqis to stand up for Iraq. I am convinced, because the last years have proven it, the President is wrong to keep suggesting we will stand down when they stand up. I believe they will not stand up until we stand down. That is the reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, the benchmarks in this supplemental are not meaningful benchmarks. The President has a complete waiver. All we require is a report, a certification from the President. Is there anybody here, based on the statements the President has made for the last 5 years, who doesn't know exactly what the President is going to say with respect to progress? All we require is that there be some measurement of "progress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say very clearly, because I have been there before in this argument, I know what happens when you vote in a way that people can easily try to pick up and construe as a vote other than what it is. There is good in this supplemental. Yes, we need money for readiness for troops, and every single one of us wants our troops to be as ready as they can be. Yes, it is good that there is money for care for veterans, and our veterans deserve the best care in the world. In fact, the money available  in this bill is a far cry from the real needs of our veterans with respect to mental health, outreach centers, the veterans centers, the VA, care in the hospitals. That could be a great deal stronger. But we are for that. We are also for the money for Katrina. So let me make it clear to anybody who wants to try to distort this vote: I am in favor of the money for readiness. I am in favor of giving our troops all the care they need and deserve. I am in favor of money for support for Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fundamental gravamen of this bill, the heart of this bill, is the strategy with respect to the war in Iraq. The heart of this bill are the consequences that we invite as a result of our votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last week or two, I have been to three funerals, one funeral, the son of a man who was opposed to the war, a military man, a West Pointer, a man  who gave his career, but he is opposed to this war. He dared to use the word to me in a conversation on the very day that his son was being buried about how it was important for us to redouble our efforts in the Senate to bring this to a close, how it was important for us not to allow these young men  and women to have their lives "wasted," a word that if any politician used, we would be pilloried for. But the father of a man who was being buried used that word on the very day his son was being buried. Another funeral I attended with a father who was overcome from emotion speaking from the pulpit, left the pulpit, came down, stood</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a responsibility with respect to those young men and women, with respect to those families. I believe that responsibility is not met when you give the President the  very same power to continue on a daily basis what he has been doing for these last years. There isn't one person in this body who doesn't know what this President is going to say with respect to progress. How many times have we heard, in the midst of this war, Vice President Cheney come out: We are making progress. The President yesterday talked about progress, even as he mischaracterizes what this war is about, talking principally about al-Qaida, when all of us know this war is principally  a civil war, a slaughter now between Shia and Sunni over the political spoils of Iraq. Our presence is empowering that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few days ago, we set a new strategy, forcing Iraqis to do what only Iraqis can do. We gave the President the full discretion to leave the troops necessary to complete the training of Iraqi security forces, to chase al-Qaida and protect U.S. forces and facilities. In the sixth year of this war, which we will reach by next year, it seems to me fair that we should expect that Iraqis can assume that responsibility. The Iraqi Government has said they can. The Iraqi Parliament has said they don't  want us there. Our own CIA tells us our presence is creating more terrorists, that we are creating a bigger target. We have become a recruitment tool for fundraising by al-Qaida out of Pakistan and Afghanistan. We now know that al-Qaida is using our presence in Iraq to raise money and recruit jihadists around the world. This policy is counter to the best security interests of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This vote is a vote about those best security interests. We demanded a little while ago a strategy of real benchmarks. There is not in this supplemental one benchmark that can be enforced, not one. I don't disagree with the benchmarks themselves. Yes, we want an oil deal. But I listened to Secretary of State Rice in front of our committee months ago say: The oil deal is just about to be approved, right around the corner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It hasn't even been put to the Parliament. It is not approved months later and too many lives lost later because of the procrastination of Iraqi politicians. How do you say to an American family that their son or daughter ought to give up their life so Iraqi politicians can spin around and play a game between each other at our expense?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unconscionable. It is bad strategy. It is bad policy. It defies common sense. That is what this vote is about: why and when we, as a Congress, are going to insist--now, I understand they do not want the deadline, and the President insists he is not going to have the deadline, notwithstanding--notwithstanding--we gave the President full discretion to leave troops there to complete the training, to leave troops to chase al-Qaida, to leave troops there to protect American facilities and forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those kids we are burying deserve an honest debate, not a debate where people come to the floor and say: Oh, these are the cut-and-run folks. These are the folks who are looking for defeat. It is an insult to any Member of the Senate to suggest somebody is actively looking for defeat. We have a different way of finding success. As Thomas Jefferson said: Dissent is the highest form of patriotism. Even the patriotism of people who offer a different road has been questioned. Well, not any longer,  and I have no fear about casting this vote against this because this is the wrong policy for Iraq. This continues the open-ended lack of accountability. This allows the President to certify whatever the President wants, to waive whatever the President wants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I promise my colleagues, we will be back here in September having the same debate with the same benchmark questions, and they will not have moved in their accountability. Even the strategy is still changing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me ask my colleagues something: When can you remember in American history hearing about a President of the United States casting about to find a general to act as the czar for a war, where four four-star generals said no to the President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>General Sheehan, a career military man--these are people whose lives are committed to defending our Nation, whose lives are committed to the troops, who, when a President would call them, you would think would be so honored and so unbelievably challenged by the moment, they would say: Of course, Mr. President, I will do what I need to do for my country. But four of them said no. And one of them was quoted, in saying no: Why would I do that because they don't know where the hell they're  going. And as he said it, he said: I would go over there for a year, I would get an ulcer, I would come back, and it would be the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an obligation to vote for a change. That is why I will cast my vote "no" on this supplemental--yes for the money for troops; yes for care; yes for readiness; yes for all the things we need to do; but, most importantly, a "yes" that we are not able to cast for a change in the entire dynamic with the Iraqis themselves and the accountability we will hold this administration to, the accountability we hold the Iraqis to, and, ultimately, a strategy for real success, not just in Iraq but  in the Middle East, where we have made Hamas more powerful, Iran more powerful, Nasrallah and Hezbollah more powerful, and our interests are being set back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to get the policy right. That is how you support the troops.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in March and April I voted for an emergency spending bill that would have fully funded our troops in Iraq but would have changed their mission--would have changed their mission--to a sound mission. That mission would have taken our troops out of the middle of a civil war and put them into a support role, as the Iraq Study Group suggested, training Iraqi soldiers and police. We would have allowed them to fight al-Qaida and protect our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President did not agree to that, and he will not agree to that. As a matter of fact, the President will not agree to any change in strategy in Iraq. That is more than a shame. For the American people, it is a tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does not seem to matter how many Americans die in Iraq, how many funerals we have here at home, or what the American people think. This President will not budge. This new bill on Iraq keeps the status quo. Oh, it has a few frills around the outside, a few reports, a few words about benchmarks--while our troops die and our troops get blown up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I understand why this legislation is before us today. It is because this President wants to continue his one-man show in Iraq. That is the only thing he will sign. The President does not respect the Congress. What is worse, he does not respect the American people when it comes to Iraq. He wants to brush us all off like some annoying spot on his jacket. Well, that is wrong, and we won't be brushed off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have lost 3,427 American soldiers in Iraq. Of those,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>731--or 21 percent--have been from my State of California or based in my State of California. Mr. President, 25,549 American soldiers have been wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you come to my office, on big boards, I have the names of the California dead and they are now blocking  the doorway, there are so many names, and we have to send the charts back for smaller and smaller print.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, after several days of worrying and praying, we received the tragic news of the death of PVT Joseph Anzack, Jr., 20 years old, of Torrance, CA, who was abducted during a deadly ambush south of Baghdad almost 2 weeks ago. One member of his platoon, SPC Daniel Seitz, summed it up this way to the Associated Press:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just angers me that it's just another friend I've got to lose and deal with, because I've already lost 13 friends since I've been here, and I don't know if I can take any more of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He should not have to. But with this bill, he will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first half of this year has already been deadlier than any 6-month period since the war began more than 4 long years ago. In this month alone, 83 U.S. servicemembers have already been killed in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear: There are many things in this bill I strongly support--many provisions I worked side by side with my colleagues to fight for, for our troops, for our veterans, for their mental health, for our farmers, for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, who so deserve our attention--but I must take a stand against this Iraq war and, therefore, I will vote "no" on this emergency spending bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are not going away. You cannot brush us off like some spot on your jacket because we are going to be back.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my concern and deep regret over the conference report to <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill>, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Appropriations Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely disappointed our troops have to continue to pay the price for our political posturing on this legislation and the inclusion of funding for pet programs in a must-pass military funding bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make very clear my strong support for the members of our Armed Forces and the vital work they are doing around the world every day. I have the greatest admiration for all of them, for their commitment to preserving our freedoms and maintaining our national security. They are all true heroes, and they are the ones who are doing the heavy lifting and making the great sacrifices in our country's name so we might continue to be the land of the free and the home of the brave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are faced with a vote on a bill that our troops need, but the troops are not the focus of this legislation. This supplemental is yet another example of a Congress whose fiscal house is not in order. It contains more than $17 billion in unrequested items--$17 billion in funding that has nothing to do with the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intent of this legislation is to fund our troops and to provide them with the resources they need to win the war on terror. Emergency supplementals are not intended to be a Christmas tree that includes presents in the form of every Member's favorite pet programs. Unfortunately, the bill we will be voting on is just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation includes funding for a number of programs I would support on their own merits. It includes agricultural disaster assistance for our Nation's ranchers who have suffered through years of drought. Many of those are in Wyoming. It includes funding for the Secure Rural Schools program. These are both important priorities for people in Wyoming, and although I support the programs on their merits, I do not support their inclusion in this emergency war supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is not intended to deal with drought relief. It is not intended to deal with SCHIP. It is not intended to deal with wildland fire management. It is intended to fund our troops. Instead of attaching these unrelated programs to a must-pass troop funding bill, a fiscally responsible Congress would examine each of these programs on their own merits through our regular appropriations process--or else we ought to call ourselves irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have made clear that we need to be fiscally responsible. They have made clear they do not support spending billions of taxpayers' dollars with little or no debate. Unfortunately, if this legislation passes, that is exactly what we are going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war supplemental also touches on various issues before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, including minimum wage and pensions. Unfortunately, our committee was not consulted on this language nor made any part of the discussions on this supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The supplemental contains a provision that will boost the Federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. I  have always believed any increase in the minimum wage must be accompanied by appropriate relief for those small business employers who have to absorb those costs. It is a mandate. Small businesses are the proven engine for our economy, and they are the greatest source of employment opportunity for U.S. workers. A raise in the minimum wage is of no value to a worker without a job or a job seeker without prospects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was for these very reasons the minimum wage package which passed the Senate, with overwhelming bipartisan support--overwhelming bipartisan support; I think there were two votes in opposition--contained a series of provisions designed to provide relief for small businesses. That is how we got it. That was bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate-passed versions of the minimum wage legislation contained significant tax relief that was targeted to small businesses and industries most likely to employ minimum wage workers. Unfortunately, much of this tax relief has been stripped from the current version of the supplemental. While some tax relief remains, the lion's share of that relief is contained in the Work Opportunity Tax Credit provisions, which, as a practical matter, are not utilized by small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the bill does continue to contain important regulatory relief provisions, such as compliance assistance for small businesses, and a small business childcare grant authorization, the tax relief this body overwhelmingly determined was necessary to help small businesses offset the cost of a new Federal minimum wage is no longer contained in the legislative package, nor were any of us consulted. I cannot support legislation that dramatically raises the Federal minimum wage and fails to acknowledge  and adequately offset the impact of such an increase on our small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to pensions, last year the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions worked with other committees in landmark legislation to author the most extensive overhaul of pension funding rules in a generation. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006, following extensive--extensive--bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Conferees were intent on ensuring that retirement plans are properly funded and that Americans' retirement savings would be there  when they need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the fundamental reasons for pension funding reform was to ensure--to ensure--the solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and its ability to guarantee benefits in plans that are underfunded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very concerned that there are provisions in the war supplemental that the House leadership claims are technical corrections to the Pension Protection Act. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act must be considered by the committees that have jurisdiction, the ones that know about all the intricacies and interrelationships of the parts that are in there, instead of legislating on an appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Kennedy and I sent a letter to Senate leadership on Tuesday night citing our concerns with the House approach. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of that letter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Retirement security is a cornerstone of the HELP Committee's jurisdiction. I recognize that technical corrections are needed to the over 900 pages of the Pension Protection Act. Bicameral, staff-level meetings are taking place at this very time, and we are working with the administration to assure that the needed corrections are promptly addressed. With the huge bipartisan, bicameral support that had before, there should be no difficulty with that, and people have been working on it  since the very time that we passed it. House leadership, by cherry-picking certain technical corrections intended for certain special interest groups, is not the way to legislate, and I would contend that they are not technical corrections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Kennedy and I, together with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, have worked extremely well on making sure that everyone has a voice at the table and that the process is transparent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generally, these provisions undo, in a piecemeal fashion, what was accomplished in the Pension Protection Act as far as strengthening funding requirements. It permits some plans to choose to have reduced funding obligations and reduced pension benefit guarantee premiums. In fact, it means that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation must refund some premiums to some employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to provide our troops with the funding and the resources they need to be successful in all their tasks. Unfortunately, this conference does not make our troops the priority of congressional business. The men and women of our armed services deserve better than this spending bill. The people of the United States deserve better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise this evening to support the supplemental appropriations bill we will be considering shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be very clear. I strongly disagree with the President on our course in Iraq. I was one of only 23 Members of the Senate to vote against going to the war in Iraq, and I am committed to changing the course, redeploying our troops, and refocusing our efforts on fighting the global war on terror. I have voted time and again for resolutions and amendments to change direction. I believe the President is wrong to continue on with an open-ended commitment to an Iraqi government that has repeatedly  failed to meet deadlines and take responsibility for its own country. I believe the President is wrong to continue to ignore the warnings of generals, experts, and the will of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also believe the President is wrong when, in his stubborn refusal to change, he also withholds money for our troops whom he has sent into harm's way. The President did just that on May 1 when he vetoed a congressionally approved supplemental that provided $4 billion more than he asked for for our troops. When the President vetoed that bill, he was the one who denied our troops the resources, equipment, and funding they need to do their jobs safely. The President was wrong, but he hasn't  changed his mind. He and the majority of Republicans in Congress are blocking funding for our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we head into this Memorial Day, I will vote for this supplemental because the President has blocked this funding for too long, and I will vote for this supplemental because Democrats in Congress have changed our course. With this bill, we have taken a responsible path forward, in spite of the President, on many of our Nation's most pressing issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, for the first time, funds the needs of our veterans and wounded warriors who have sacrificed for all of us and whose needs the President has refused to acknowledge as the cost of war. This bill makes our homeland more secure by investing critical funds in our ports and our borders, and this bill aids the recovery of hard-hit communities across the country and in the gulf coast where families have continued to suffer due to neglect from this administration. In just 5 short months, Democrats  have provided a new commitment to the American people, a new direction in Iraq, and we are going to continue on this new path to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the start of the war in Iraq, the Republican Congress allowed President Bush a free hand. They held few oversight hearings. They demanded no accountability. There were no wide-ranging investigations into this administration's endless mistakes. Year after year, they sent the President blank checks in the form of emergency supplementals. Now, 5 years into this war, after 5 years without accountability, 3,400 of our heroes have died, and over 25,000 have been injured. Our troops are now policing  a civil war in Iraq. Billions of taxpayer dollars are unaccounted for. The reconstruction of Iraq is far from complete, and our veterans are facing awful conditions when they return home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November, voters asked for an end to this. They voted for us to stand up, ask difficult questions, and hold those who make mistakes accountable for them. Democrats heard that call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately after being sworn in, we began to hold hearings. We heard from military and foreign affairs experts and called administration officials to testify--under oath. We began conducting investigations into prewar intelligence, the waste of taxpayer dollars, and the treatment of our veterans. Democrats began holding vote after vote on Iraq. We forced Republicans to make clear to Americans where they stood on the war: Are they for escalation or redeployment? Are they for allowing Iraqis to  continue to shirk their responsibility or for forcing them to stand up?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, President Bush ignored calls from Congress to follow the Iraq Study Group recommendations. Instead, he escalated our troops in Iraq. Congressional Republicans refused to criticize the escalation and stood by the President and attacked anyone who spoke out against that surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But congressional Democrats stood strong. We upheld our constitutional duties and what Americans put us in office for--conducting oversight and holding the administration accountable for its actions. This trend continued for months, and eventually, though slowly, some of my Republican colleagues began separating from the President and siding with us and the American people. After months of this, Democrats overcame Republican opposition and passed a bill with redeployment provisions. We sent that  bill, based on the advice from the Iraq Study Group and military leaders and supported by 64 percent of Americans, to the President. We hoped he would read that bill. We hoped he would realize it was the best way forward in Iraq. But he didn't, and he vetoed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, finally, after months of blindly following the President, more and more of our colleagues on the other side are beginning to stand up to the President, demanding benchmarks and a timeline for change in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that despite a slim majority in the House and only a one-vote margin in the Senate, Democratic efforts are working. Today is further evidence of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we pass tonight will not be perfect. It doesn't go nearly as far as many of us would like. We, along with the American people, have made it clear what we want--a new direction that forces Iraqis to take control of their own country. Unfortunately, the President has said he would veto that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today we have a bill that takes a step forward with our changing course in Iraq. It forces the White House to acknowledge the will of the American people and the role of Congress, it pressures Iraqis to stand up, and, importantly, it funds our troops. The hard truth, of course, is that not enough Democrats are here to override a veto. We realize that another veto will not serve our troops well. They need our funds; they don't need another White House delay. So we are moving ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say it again: This bill is not all I hoped for, but this war is not going to be brought to a close in 1 day. It is not going to be brought to a close with one bill. We will support our troops, and we will bring an end to the war in Iraq. We will continue to debate and force votes on this war week after week after week. Americans will continue to hear where the Republicans stand on this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We face terror threats around the world. We must, and we will, defeat them. Unfortunately, the Iraqi civil war is not making us more secure. We do need to refocus our fight back on the war on terror, and we do need to rebuild our military. I support a new direction in Iraq so that we can focus on the larger security challenges our country faces, and they are high. But I know we can improve security at home, that we can track down and eliminate terrorists around the world, and that we can take  care of our servicemembers. It is a matter of getting our priorities straight. Redeploying our troops from Iraq is an important first step toward getting those priorities straight. It is a step the Senate must take, just as passing this bill tonight is one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, however, is about much more than just Iraq; it is about taking care of the best military in the world, both when they are deployed and when they return home. It is about rebuilding here in America, on the gulf coast and on family farms from coast to coast, and it is about providing hard-working Americans struggling to care for their families with a desperately needed raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not satisfied with the Iraq language in this bill. I disagree with Senator Warner's language. I voted against it last week. But I am proud of what we were able to accomplish in this bill--in particular, taking care of the troops, which this bill does. It includes billions more than the President requested to train and equip and take care of our fighting men and women and to make sure we care for them when they come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So tonight, when we vote, I will cast my vote as a yes--not for the Warner language, not for the language on Iraq, but to make sure that those men and women whom we have sent to battle, despite how I feel, have the care and support they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of the supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I opposed the authorization to go to war in Iraq because I thought it would be a tragic error, and it has proved to be. Iraq did not attack this country; al-Qaida did. Sometimes I think that is somehow lost in this discussion. It was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, not Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, who masterminded the attacks of September 11. That is a fact. That is a reality. I think it was one of the great mistakes in American history that we launched an attack on Iraq before ever finishing  business with al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we face a difficult choice. We have 160,000 troops in the field, and I believe we must fund those troops until there is a responsible plan to redeploy them. Unfortunately, this President has absolutely refused to construct such a plan. I believe that leaves us with little choice but to fund the troops in this resolution before us tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have in this package a matter of great interest to the people whom I represent, so I would like to speak for just a moment on a separate subject; that is, the disaster relief which is contained in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced a comprehensive disaster plan 3 years ago. The Senate has supported it, most recently in a vote of 74 to 23 on the Senate floor. The House supported it 2 weeks ago in a vote of over 302 Members in support. Today, it received 348 votes. Now we have an assurance we did not have before--that the disaster package will be signed by President Bush. This has been a long, hard fight, but it is critically important to the people whom I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These have been the headlines all across my State:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crops Lost To Flooding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beet Crop Smallest in 10 Years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heavy Rain Leads to Crop Diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rain Halts Harvest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Area Farmers Battle Flooding and Disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the picture which we saw in my State 2 years ago. I flew over southeastern North Dakota, and it looked like a giant lake. Over a million acres were prevented from even being planted. Another million acres had tremendous losses in production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, irony of ironies, last year we had one of the worst droughts in our Nation's history--by scientific measurement, the third worst drought in American history--and the Dakotas were the epicenter of that drought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it got very little attention. It wasn't like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which were disasters that were immediately evident, and which received enormous national media attention. This was a slow-developing tragedy but a tragedy nonetheless. The Dakotas were right at the heart of it--North Dakota and South Dakota. It was rated as an exceptional drought--not extreme or severe or moderate, which are the other measurements, but an exceptional drought. Exceptional it was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the map of the U.S. Drought Monitor. They concluded it was the third worst drought in our Nation's history, right down the center of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see in this picture taken near my home in Burleigh County, ND, the corn is supposed to be knee-high by July 4, but it was just over the edge of this man's boot. I went into a cornfield that was irrigated. The farmer started shucking the corn, and every other row was empty. I asked him how can that be? He told me: Senator, this week it was 112 degrees one day. We had day after day where it was over 100 degrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This led to a devastating series of losses. The bankers of my State came to me and said: If there is not help, 5 to 10 percent of our clients are going to be out of business. That is how serious and consequential this is. Without this help, thousands of farm and ranch families will be forced off the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is funded as an emergency and doesn't require offsets from other programs. This is a change from the 2004 agriculture disaster package. Producers will be eligible for assistance for one year only. Assistance payments plus the value of crop sales and crop insurance cannot exceed 95 percent of the expected crop value, so nobody is getting rich.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't allow producers to receive multiple benefits for the same loss. So there is no double-dipping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crop assistance eligibility requires a 35-percent loss before there is a dime of assistance, and the payment rate is 42 percent of the established price for insured crops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Livestock producers are eligible for both a livestock compensation program to help offset forage losses and feed costs and a livestock indemnity program to help cover death losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues in the Senate and the House who have worked tirelessly for the last 3 years to help deliver this assistance. It has been bipartisan in the Senate. It has been a long and hard fight, but it is going to be a lifeline to thousands of farm and ranch families in my State. This is a bill the President should sign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am glad this long and unfortunate political process has apparently come to an end, so we can now provide the funding for our troops that has been needed for some time. The failure to do so has created uncertainty and ambiguity and has, I believe, undermined our policies in Iraq in a number of different ways. Historically, politics have stopped at the water's edge. That was a cardinal rule of American foreign policy that you might agree with or not, but you would  not criticize fundamental decisions made by the United States while things are ongoing in various places in the world and, certainly, you would not take steps and actions that would undermine our troops in combat someplace in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vigorous debate is absolutely a part of who we are as a Nation. A lot of people who have been critical of our war efforts in Iraq have made suggestions that have been good. A number of their criticisms have been correct, and it is certainly welcome and a part of our heritage that we would have that kind of debate. I don't mean to suggest otherwise. But the delays we have been seeing now in actually providing the funding necessary for our military men and women in harm's way has been too long.  I believe it has had a tendency to embolden our enemies and raise questions in the minds of our own soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as I have said a number of times on the floor of the Senate, those soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan today are there for one reason, and that is because we sent them. They are doing tough, hot, demanding, dangerous work. I have been there six times. I have to tell you, I have never been more impressed. They don't complain. They do their work with professionalism. They care about what they are doing. They believe in what they are doing. They want to succeed, and I tell you that with every fiber  in my being. It is their desire to help the country of Iraq achieve stability and progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are executing lawful policies of the U.S. Government. That includes the Congress--the House and Senate--as well as the President of the United States. We have, through lawful processes, deployed them to execute policies that we have decided on. This Congress, of course, has the power to bring them home at any moment that we desire. I think people are wrestling with that. Some think they should come home now. Some think that is not the appropriate decision. The President believes that is  not the appropriate decision. We have accepted and have fundamentally affirmed the surge that has sent additional troops there. They are there to execute our mission. That is all I wish to say. They are there to execute our mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked to a mother not long ago whose son was killed in Iraq. She told me her son told her he believed in what he was doing. He told me when they went into neighborhoods, the women and children were glad they were there. They wanted them in the neighborhoods. That is all I am telling you. You can read what you want to in the newspaper. But because it brought a sense of security there, they wanted them there. I know there are limits to our ability to achieve what we would like to achieve, no  matter what we would like to achieve; I know we are not unlimited in our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ability to achieve it. We have to be realistic, and we cannot commit a single soldier to an effort a single day longer than we conclude is an appropriate thing for them to be doing. If we think it is not justified and worthwhile, we need to bring them home. I certainly agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a serious discussion we have been having, and I don't dispute the people who have different views of how this ought to occur. I will say again that real support of the soldiers in harm's way means we affirm them and their mission as long as we fund their mission, as long as we order them there. You may say we didn't order them there, but we did order them there. We have funded them to stay there, according to the President's tactical decision. But we authorized him to do so, and we can  end that authorization as we choose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the truth is, we have invested a tremendous amount in Iraq. General Petraeus--what a fabulous general he is--told us the truth, I believe. The truth is it is hard, but it is not impossible. He also has said what we are doing there is important. It is important that a stable, decent government be maintained in Iraq. That is not a little thing; it is a very important thing. The soldiers who have been there--the soldiers who serve--would be, indeed, in pain and be hurt if we prematurely give  up on what they have sacrificed to achieve and what so many of them truly believe in, if you talk to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to tell you that the surge of troops into Iraq was a bitter pill to me. I remember distinctly when General Casey said in late 2005 he believed we could start bringing home troops in 2006. That was absolutely music to my ears and what I wanted to hear. Then he said he had to delay the troops coming home because the sophisticated, sustained effort by al-Qaida to attack Shia individuals in holy places had created a reaction by Shia, with the formation of a Shia militia, and they were killing  Sunni individuals and that broke out into a spate of violence in Baghdad, the capital city, the central focus of Iraq, and that was extremely unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my thinking is this: Benchmarks for the Iraqi Government--if we write that correctly and don't do it in a way that is unwise and counterproductive, as I believe this language is, at least it would be language the President can accept, and I would be prepared to accept the demand that they do certain things. That is all right with me. Our commitment is not open-ended. We cannot continue to try to lift a government that cannot function effectively. We want them to function. We want them to have  a healthy, prosperous government. There are some good things that have happened--really and truly, there have been good things. But there are very difficult things also that are not going well. This is a challenge to the Iraqi Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly hope the benchmarks and language in this funding resolution will be such that it will be a positive spur to the Iraqi Government to confront their reconciliation difficulties, spur them to reach agreements on other constitutional questions that are critical, and be an effective step in helping that Government stand up and assume responsibility for its own fate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say I am not comfortable and am indeed uneasy with high troop levels sustained in what would be considered an occupation or a stand-in for the democratically elected Government of Iraq. That Government has to stand up and assume greater and greater responsibility. I do hope and pray that they will because it is exceedingly important that they do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it is important that, in response to the comments of my friend Senator ENZI, I set the record straight for the Senate and the American people regarding the practice of including unrequested emergency funding in war supplementals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The emergency supplemental bills approved by Republican Congresses in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 included emergency funding for many of the same issues that are in the emergency supplemental, such as: agriculture disaster assistance--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$500 million; border security--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$1.9 billion; pandemic flu--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$2.3 billion; wildland fire suppression--fiscal year 2005 Defense Appropriations Act, which carried</paragraph>
    <paragraph>fisheries assistance--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$112 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House has complained about Democrats including agricultural disaster assistance in the war supplemental. Not only did the Republican Congress approve a targeted agriculture disaster package in 2006, but there is also precedent for including assistance to a sector in the economy that has been hard hit by a disaster. In 2003, Congress approved $515 million of relief for the aviation industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House has also complained about Democrats including other matter in a war supplemental, such as the minimum wage increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet under Republican control, war supplemental laws included such unrelated matters as the REAL ID Act, fiscal year 2005, a temporary worker program, fiscal year 2005, and budget process provisions, fiscal year 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify for my colleagues the real record when it comes to meeting the needs of the American people in emergency supplemental appropriation bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while there are many aspects of this conference report that I cannot support, I am pleased that it will finally allow us to get a minimum wage bill to the President's desk. The minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 an hour for more than 10 years, but now--finally Americans across the country will get the raise they need and deserve. For the millions of working families who will benefit, this increase may be long overdue, but it is nonetheless something to celebrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 13 million Americans will see more money in their paychecks  for the first time in a decade. They will have a few more dollars to spend on the essentials of life, or maybe they will have a few more hours to spare to spend time with their families; 6 million children will have better food, better health, and better opportunities for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I deeply regret that this vital increase was so long in coming. The minimum wage bill passed the House and Senate by overwhelming margins in January and February of this year. Had we been able to send that bill to the President's desk right away, the first phase of the raise would already be in effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would not let that happen. They prevented the minimum wage bill from going to conference until they could make sure it included a big enough tax giveaway for businesses. That is why were here talking about it today. We had to put in on a bill they couldn't block to get it to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have overcome many obstacles--and faced every procedural trick in the book--to get this minimum wage increase across the finish line. Democrats stood together, and stood firm, to say that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we didn't do it alone. The passage of the minimum wage is not merely a legislative victory--it's a victory for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After years of delay and inexcusable inaction by Congress, the American people took this fight into their own hands. They started a grassroots movement that spread across the Nation like wildfire. They pounded the pavements. They prayed in their pews. They refused to take no for an answer. We are here today because of their efforts, and they deserve the gratitude of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minimum wage is one of the great achievements of our proud democracy. It is a reflection of our values, and a cornerstone of the American dream. It is about the kind of country we want to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans want to live in a country where everyone has opportunity and the chance to succeed. Where anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can build a better life for their family. Where there is no permanent underclass, and everyone has hope for a brighter future. When the President signs a minimum wage increase into law, we will be one step closer to that noble goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, the increase we have passed today is only the first of many steps we must take to address the problems of poverty and inequality in our society. There is no doubt that we need to do much, much more. But it's important to take a moment today to celebrate this victory. Raising the minimum wage will add dignity to the lives of millions of working families. It is one of the proudest achievements of this new Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, due to a family medical emergency, I am returning to Minnesota this evening and will be unable to cast my vote in favor of the supplemental appropriations bill. I believe the Senate is taking responsible action by passing critical funding for the troops without attaching it to arbitrary timelines for withdrawal.

I wish that our surge had, at long last, brought quiet to the tortured city of Baghdad. I wish that our President's policies were  working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish that I could look at Iraq and say, with a clear voice and a clean conscience: I share our President's confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish; and even as I wish, the truth tells me otherwise. It tells me that 3,415 men and women in uniform have already sacrificed everything in Iraq, with no end in sight. It tells me that our military is being hollowed out by the Iraq experience, that two-thirds of our Army in the United States and 88 percent of our National Guard are forced to report: Not ready for duty, sir. It tells me that the American people demand an end to this war, and that the Iraqi people--for whose sake we toppled  a dictator and established elections, precisely so we could hear their voice--demand the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look at this bill and I don't see the truth in it. It exists in a world in which the President's plans are all meeting their mark. It gives us a status-quo strategy that has failed and failed again. It writes the President a blank check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had hoped that this supplemental would have passed with strong timetables for withdrawal, a unambiguous line in the sand. A responsible supplemental would have established definitive guidance for the President to transition the mission of our forces away from combat operations. It would have defined that mission clearly as counter-terrorism, training of Iraqi forces, and American force protection. It would have required a diplomatic and economic strategy in Iraq. And it would have held both  the President and the Iraqi Government accountable. The Feingold-Reid-Dodd bill contained just such timetables, and mandated a responsible transition in mission, all backed by Congress's constitutional power of the purse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I cannot, in good conscience, support the half-measure that has taken its place. Instead of establishing realistic timetables, this supplemental does one thing only: It delays for 4 months, until funding runs out again, the decision we all know is coming: ultimately, combat troops will be redeployed from Iraq. This bill allows 4 more months of reckless endangerment of our troops and our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Senator shouldn't talk like that, some will say. I will be told I am declaring surrender right here on the Senate floor. Those are the words that will come from the other side of the aisle, big, grand words--surrender, triumph, defeat, victory--words that will blur and swirl together until they lose all mooring in reality. The President's supporters want to paint us a picture of a world in which we line up on a field of battle, the terrorists on one side and America on the other, and fight  pitched warfare until one side waves the white flag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Iraq does not exist in that world. General Petraeus tells us that there will be no military solution; so does the Iraq Study Group. Senator Hagel, a war hero and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, tells us that "there will be no victory or defeat in Iraq ..... Iraq belongs to the 25 million Iraqis who live there ..... Iraq is not a prize to be won or lost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am not conceding defeat in Iraq--because there is no defeat to be conceded. There is only the hope that Sunni, Shia, and Kurd will reconcile in government, call off their militias and death squads, and turn against the foreign terrorists who have helped to spark this civil war. Our combat presence in Iraq cannot make that hope real. We can, and must, continue to assist the Iraqis in trying to reach these goals--but we cannot do it with military might alone. In the end, the challenges in  Iraq can only be addressed through political means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told, again and again, that we are failing to "support the troops"--support that is subject to only the vaguest of measurements: "messages" and "signals" and "resolve."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We answer with fact. We answer with young lives lost and dollars squandered. We answer with the wisdom of James Baker and Lee Hamilton. We ask how any conceivable definition of "support" would leave our troops stranded in a civil war of strangers, with no mission or end in sight. And we say, unequivocally, that the only way to support our troops is to bring them home--now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, from the very outset of this war, it has been the President's defense policies that have hollowed out our Armed Forces and further threatened our national security. To reverse this negligence, Democrats have taken concrete action for our troops, again and again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, I offered an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to add $322 million for critical protective gear identified by the Army, which the Bush administration had failed to include in its budget.  But it was blocked by the administration and its allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004 and 2005, I authored legislation, signed into law, to reimburse troops for equipment they had to purchase on their own, because the Rumsfeld Pentagon failed to provide them with the body armor and other gear they needed to stay alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last year, working with Senators Inouye, Reed, and Stevens, I offered an amendment to help address a $17 billion budget shortfall to replace and repair thousands of war-battered tanks, aircraft, and vehicles. This provision was approved unanimously and enacted in law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is support--support that can be measured, support that carries a cost beyond words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is support that will continue, even if this supplemental fails, as it should. The Defense Department has ample funds to maintain our combat troops in Iraq until they can be withdrawn responsibly. The failure of this bill will not turn funds off like a spigot--the military simply does not work like that. Instead, our troops are supported by the more than $150 billion in the Pentagon's regular operations and maintenance account--and in the meantime, we might negotiate with the President  for a responsible drawdown of combat troops. Any implication that we are stranding our soldiers in the desert--without fuel or bullets or rations--is totally specious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it follows that the President's Memorial Day deadline is totally arbitrary. The lives of our troops are more important than the President's vacation schedule. Why should he set timelines for Democrats but not for Iraqis?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, let us vote down this bill and then join President Bush at the table, with the dignity befitting an equal branch of government, and the authority vested in us by the American people and our Constitution. Let us bring this disastrous war to a responsible end. And after 4 years of failed policy, let our voice be loud and unmistakeable: This far, and no further.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will vote against the fiscal year 2007 emergency supplemental conference report. Although there are many sound and worthy provisions in this bill--such as assistance for Afghanistan and other countries, and additional funds not requested by the administration to help address the backlog of equipment for the National Guard--the inescapable fact is that this legislation would not reverse this administration's disastrous Iraq policy. I simply cannot vote in favor of a  bill, containing tens of billions of additional dollars for the President's policy in Iraq, that does not begin to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one of the 23 Senators who opposed authorizing this war, I believe it is vital that we send a strong signal that Congress is going to exercise its article I constitutional powers and end our central involvement in Iraq's civil war. Every Senator--for or against this military adventure--must take a stand on whether to continue the status quo or change course. That, at the end of the day, is what this vote represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress had a workable and I believe widely acceptable plan in the original version of this supplemental bill. Taking a page from the Iraq Study Group recommendations, the plan was to end the military mission in Iraq as we currently know it. We would reduce American forces to the contingent necessary for limited Iraqi troop training, counterterrorism operations, and protecting remaining American personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I and others joined with Senator Feingold in an effort to strengthen that position by ensuring that no funding could go toward deployment, beyond those narrow purposes. About a month ago, we all saw the President veto the supplemental bill. Then last week, the President muscled his congressional allies to vote against the stronger Feingold-Reid-Leahy provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are left with is this new version of the supplemental--the status quo, more of the same old stay the course. The reality is that this new conference report does nothing to stop the President's open-ended escalation. It will not force the Iraqis to make the difficult political compromises which they need to make. Nor will it begin a redeployment of American forces. The final legislation drops the mandatory timetable for planning and commencing redeployment with a targeted completion  date. Beyond some reporting requirements, there is no limitation on troop levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the legislation does do is limit our aid to the Iraqi government if actions toward reconciliation are not taken, although the President may waive these limitations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree that we should tie our aid to the Iraqi government to clear benchmarks. But that alone is not sufficient. The reality is that despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq, the violence has increased. We all know that the trends are going in the wrong direction. This piecemeal approach assures that our troops will remain in the middle of harm's way for the foreseeable future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when it comes to changing the dynamic in Iraq, it is troop levels that matter. The introduction of more forces through this open-ended escalation that the President calls the surge is sending the wrong signal to the Iraqis and to countries in the region that have interests there. It says they do not have to make the tough decisions because the American forces are there to do the dirty work, to spill their blood and to contain sectarian militias or deal with unwelcome foreign fighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rory Stewart, a perspicacious observer with hands-on experience in Iraq, rightly pointed out in a recent public forum that our presence there is fundamentally undermining Iraq's political system, "infantilizing" Iraq politics, to use his phrase. He notes that Iraqi politicians are far more capable of making deals and reaching compromise than we think, but that our troop presence allows them to play hardball with each other. "Were we to leave," Mr. Stewart says, "they would be weaker and  under more pressure to compromise."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said, there are many aspects of this supplemental that I support. We have, for example, included $1 billion in unrequested funding to help rebuild our National Guard, which is suffering from dangerously low equipment stocks because so much of the Guard's equipment has been sent to Iraq. We have funded the Marla Ruzicka Fund to aid innocent Iraqi civilians who have suffered casualties, and a similar program to aid civilian victims of war in Afghanistan. There is other funding for refugees  and humanitarian assistance in Africa and the Middle East, as well as for Kosovo. I am gratified that we have been able to include funding for elections in Nepal, to support reintegration of former combatants in northern Uganda, and to begin the clean up of dioxin-contaminated sites in Vietnam and for health programs in nearby communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few of the things carried over from the original, vetoed version of the bill that I support and for which I have worked hard. I thank Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and our counterparts in the House, Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf, for working together in a bipartisan way to allocate the foreign assistance funding in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet there is a central fact that we must meet head on. This war has been a costly disaster for our country. Our ability to fight terrorism, pursue our larger national security and foreign policy goals, and secure the welfare of every American has been diminished because of it. Thousands of our troops have lost their lives or suffered grievous, life-altering injuries. Tens of thousands--and possibly hundreds of thousands--of innocent Iraqis have lost their lives. We have opened a gaping wound  in the Middle East and severely damaged our image and our influence. This war has been a foreign policy failure of epic proportions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to bring our troops home. It is time to show the Iraqi people that they cannot expect us to make these sacrifices if they won't make the hard decisions that are spread before them. I regret that this legislation whitewashes what was a reasonable, good faith effort to bring real pressure to bear in Baghdad and beyond. I cannot in good conscious vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate is about to act on <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill>, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007, which will fully fund the needs of our men and  women in uniform. The process that we have used to reach this point has been somewhat different from our normal course of business. As such, I wanted to engage my cochairman of the Defense Subcommittee, the Senator for Alaska, in a colloquy on the defense portion of this  bill. The bill before the Senate is not accompanied by the customary report because of the way the process unfolded. However, it is also true that for matters involving the allocation of funding and direction for those matters under the jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE FUNDING">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend from Hawaii that it is my understanding that the Senator is correct. I am advised that the funding in this bill for Defense Subcommittee matters is identical to that agreed to by the Senate on April 26, 2007, except in three areas. The increase in this bill for the Defense Health program is nearly $1.876 billion while the previous bill would have increased the health program by $2.126 billion. In addition, this bill has reduced funding for the Defense Working Capital  Fund by $200 million and reduced the initiative for the Strategic Reserve Readiness Fund by $385 million. Aside from these changes the funding in this bill is exactly the same as previously passed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for that clarification. Therefore, I ask my friend whether he agrees that the allocation of funds that the Congress provided for these defense programs as described in the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference to accompany <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>, except for those three areas that he just specified, is exactly the intent of this bill that we are about to pass?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE FUNDING">
    <paragraph>I agree completely with my good friend. The intent of those of us who oversee the Defense Department and the drafting of this bill was to provide funds as specified in the joint explanatory statement which accompanied <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE FUNDING">
    <paragraph>Again, I thank my colleague. If I could make another inquiry, the Congress also included items in House Report 110-60 and Senate Report 110-37 which provided guidance to the Defense Department on several items in this bill. Would the Senator from Alaska agree with me that the intent of the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense was that the guidance in these reports should be adhered to except in those areas that were altered in this bill or those  areas that were addressed to the contrary in the joint explanatory statement to <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE FUNDING">
    <paragraph>I concur in the Senator's assessment. The Defense Subcommittee reviewed many matters before it prepared Senate Report 110-37 regarding the supplemental appropriations request before the Senate. In putting together <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill>, our intent was to continue the guidance that the Senate included in its report. In addition, we have concurred in the guidance of House Report 110-60 except in those areas specifically noted in the joint explanatory statement which accompanied <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE FUNDING">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend I agree with his assertion. I share his view that the Department of Defense should use the two committee reports and the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference accompanying <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill> to discern the will of Congress in respect to this bill <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, our service men and women on the front lines in the war on terror have been waiting too long for the funding this bill provides. Our soldiers, airmen, and marines need this appropriation to carry out their vital work, and we should have provided it months ago. The Congress, which authorized the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has an obligation to give our troops everything they need to prevail in their missions. As such, I will vote for its passage. But I do  so with deep reservations. The legislation we are considering now is the wrong way to fund this war, and it fails the most basic tests imposed on us as stewards of taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This emergency supplemental appropriations bill contains $120 billion in funding, approximately $17 billion above the President's request. It is filled with billions of dollars in non-emergency spending that has nothing to do with funding the troops. In a time of war, with large federal budget deficits, we should be constraining our Federal expenditures. Sadly, we have chosen, once again, to do the opposite, and loaded this bill with billions of dollars in spending we don't need, spending that  was not requested, spending that will only add to the already excessive size of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President submitted his supplemental funding request on February 5 nearly 4 months ago. The Senate finally passed a very flawed version of a bill on March 29 a bill that everyone knew was nothing more than a political stunt, one that was dead before arrival to the President. Instead of putting our country first and providing the troops with full funding as expeditiously as possible, we let partisan politics rule the day. While some may believe that they scored political points by forcing  meaningless procedural votes, I would ask them to reflect for a moment. What gain inheres in playing partisan politics with the lives of our honorable warriors and their families? How can we possibly find honor in using the fate of our servicemen to score</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now, nearly 4 months after the supplemental funding request was submitted, here we are, with money literally running out to fund this war. We are about to pass a bill that while better than the last version, still contains billions of dollars that have nothing to do with the war on terror. We can do better than this. The American taxpayers deserve and expect more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, I have been meeting with citizens across the country, and let me assure you, they are not happy with the workings of Congress. There is a reason that the poll results on Congress's favorability rating are at such lows the latest at 31 percent. It is because of partisan politics having a greater priority in Washington than doing the people's business. It is because we are not making the tough choices to halt deficit spending and fix the out of control entitlement programs.  It is because we seem to care more about our own reelections than about reforming government. This is not the way the American public wants their elected officials to behave. What will it take for that to sink in?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me mention some of the unrequested and unauthorized items contained in this bill: $110 million in aid to the shrimp and fisheries industries; $11 million for flood control projects in New York and New Jersey; $37 million to modernize the Farm Service Agency's computer system; $13 million for the Save America's Treasures program; and, $3 billion in agriculture disaster assistance, including $22 million to support the Department of Agriculture in implementing programs to provide this un-requested  and unauthorized funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also several items in this bill that seek to legislate on an appropriations bill rather than allowing such items to move through the regular legislative process. Examples include language that: raises the minimum wage; restricts the Department of Transportation from implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement's, NAFTA, provisions expanding cross-border trade between Mexico and the  United States with the introduction of a pilot program  that would allow a select group of Mexican trucking companies to make deliveries into our country beyond the 25 miles that current law permits; extends several tax credits, while setting forth new Internal Revenue Service definitions and exempting some programs from taxation; and, amends the Food Security Act to make adjustments to the Department of Agriculture's land and soil conservation program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision that seeks to legislate on this appropriations bill is a provision that would end-run the Defense Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, process. The 2005 BRAC commission decided to close the Naval Air Station at Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and the Department of Navy was in the process of closing the base in accordance with the law. This bill, however, would transfer the land and facilities to the Air Force even though the Secretary of the Air Force stated on April 12, 2007, that  there is not a military need for the land it will be forced to receive. This provision was not requested by the administration, is not an emergency, and is not a responsible way to legislate. It was not reviewed or debated in any committee, and the committee of jurisdiction has had no say in the matter. Yet the American people will now be forced to continue to pay for the maintenance of this unwanted land when the Air Force receives it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these unacceptable earmarks and legislative language, I am pleased that this bill does not contain a timeline for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, regardless of the conditions there. Such a mandate would have had grave consequences for the future of Iraq and the security of Americans. The President was right to veto the first iteration of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have concerns, however, with the way in which this measure conditions aid to the Iraqi Government by requiring the government to meet benchmarks. Although I support benchmarks for the Iraqi Government, and I believe that we should encourage the Iraqi government to move ahead as rapidly as possible on a number of fronts, some of the benchmarks contained in this bill are beyond the control of the Iraqi leadership. One of the benchmarks, for example, mandates that there will be no safe haven  for "any outlaws." This should of course be an aspiration, but if terrorists or insurgents hang on and hole up in Baghdad, should this constitute a reason why the United States withholds economic aid to the government? Similarly, another benchmark requires</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that, instead of legislating a list of benchmarks that must be met by the Iraqis, and imposing statutory penalties for nonperformance, it would be preferable for the administration to reach agreement on a series of benchmarks with the Iraqi government, a timeline for implementation, and consequences attached to each. Such an approach would make clear to the Iraqis that they must make progress, but would do so in a way that is specific, flexible, and realistic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill is to have benchmarks at all, it should be a benchmark that Congress may not approve any earmark, no matter how valid the cause, without an authorization, an administration request or inclusion in the budget. The national debt grows $75 million an hour and $1.3 billion a day. Congress should benchmark its spending sprees on zero debt, but it won't. This body would rather set benchmarks for others around the world than take responsibility for its own actions. For these reasons, this  bill is flawed and irresponsible, but I will vote for it nonetheless in order to support our brave men and women fighting for freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the tax provisions included in this bill would help small businesses to succeed. These provisions would spur investment and thus create jobs. They would provide greater opportunity for workers looking for a job. They all enjoy strong support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill helps businesses to provide jobs for workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce by extending and expanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, or WOTC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WOTC encourages businesses to hire workers who might not otherwise find work. WOTC allows employers a tax credit for wages that they pay to economically disadvantaged employees. WOTC has been remarkably successful. By reducing expenditures on public assistance, WOTC is highly cost-effective. The business community is highly supportive of these credits. Industries like retail and restaurants that hire many low-skill workers find it especially useful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would extend WOTC for more than 3 years, and the bill would increase and expand the credit for employers who hire disabled veterans. The bill would also expand the credit to make it available to employers who hire people in counties that have suffered significant population losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To carry out day-to-day activities, small business owners are often required to invest significant amounts of money in depreciable property, such as machinery. The bill would help business owners to afford these large purchases for their businesses. To do so, the bill would extend for another year expensing under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New equipment and property are necessary to successfully operate a business. But large business purchases generally require depreciation across a number of years, and depreciation requires additional bookkeeping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expensing under section 179 allows for an immediate 100-percent deduction of the cost for most personal property purchased for use in a business. The bill increases the expensing limit from $112,000 to $125,000, and the bill increases the phase-out threshold from $450,000 to $500,000 for 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When small business owners are able to expense equipment, they no longer have to keep depreciation records on that equipment. So extending section 179 expensing would ease small business bookkeeping burdens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes a package of tax incentives to help recovery of small business and low-income housing in areas hit by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The bill also requires GAO to conduct a study on how State and local governments have allocated and utilized the tax incentives that have been provided for these areas since 2005. We want to make sure that the tax incentives that Congress provided for hurricane recovery are being properly used, and we want to make sure that these incentives  are providing the much-needed help for which they were created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tips received by restaurant employees are treated as wages for purposes of Social Security taxes. As such, employers must pay Social Security taxes on tips received by their employees. These employers receive a business tax credit for taxes paid on tip income in excess of the Federal minimum wage rate. The bill would prevent a decrease in the amount of this business tax credit that restaurant owners may claim despite an increase in the Federal minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, if a small business jointly owned by a married couple files taxes as a sole proprietorship, only the filing spouse receives credit for paying Social Security and Medicare taxes. Furthermore, unless the married couple is located in a community property State, both the married couple and the business are subject to penalties for failing to file as a partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would allow an unincorporated business that is jointly owned by a married couple in a common law State to file as a sole proprietorship without penalty. The bill would also ensure that both spouses receive credit for paying Social Security and Medicare taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law limits a small business' ability to claim WOTC and the tip credit by imposing a limitation that such credits cannot be used to offset taxes that would be imposed under the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. The bill would provide a permanent waiver for WOTC and the tip credit and would allow WOTC and the tip credit to be taken under AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would help small businesses by modifying S corporation rules. These modifications reduce the effect of what some call the "sting tax." These modifications would improve the viability of community banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax language included in the bill is a responsible package. It would ensure the continued growth and success of small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have also paid for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offsets include a proposal to discourage the practice of transferring investments to one's child for the purpose of avoiding higher tax rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offsets also include proposals to improve tax administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offsets would allow the IRS more time to notify the taxpayer about a deficiency before it must stop charging interest and penalties. The offsets include making permanent the fees that the IRS is authorized to charge for private letter rulings and other forms of guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offsets also enhance penalties that the IRS may impose when taxpayers and preparers do not comply with the law. The offsets would also prohibit employers from using the collection due process to delay or prevent the IRS from collecting delinquent trust fund employment taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hard-working American taxpayers whom we are trying to help in this bill should not have to pay more in taxes because some taxpayers are abusing the tax system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the public a technical explanation of the tax provisions of <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill>. The technical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. It will be available on the Joint Committee's website at www.house.gov/jct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are sound tax policy changes. Let's finally enact an increase in the minimum wage, and let's also pass this useful package of tax benefits to help America's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
