  <narrative>SCHIP -- (Senate - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13030">S13030</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to talk this morning on the much-talked-about subject of SCHIP. In this Chamber over the last several days--and I would say all over the Nation--there has been a lot of conversation about the future of the State Children's Health Insurance Program and whether this side will budge or that side will nudge the other one or who will blink first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we are at an impasse. Today, the President's veto of this bill--which will enlarge Government by $35 billion--will be sustained in the House, I believe. Then we will find ourselves at a place where we have to regroup and decide how to proceed in reauthorizing this very important program. It is an important program, and a program so many of America's children have benefited from, and one for which I believe we need to find a way to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to add my voice to those who have called for the program's reauthorization. This is a program that is working. It works in the State of Florida. It is a program that helps children. I know a lot of Florida children have been helped by it. So we have to find a way we can come together in the spirit of the program so every child who needs health care has the needed access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should take great care, however, to avoid switching SCHIP from being a program aimed at helping poor children to a program that moves us toward a Government-sponsored, Government-run health care system. That would not serve the people in the program, and it would not serve the greater cause of reforming the bigger problem we have, and which we also have to address, which is our entire health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill the President vetoed would have allowed coverage to the point where we would have essentially encouraged families who are today receiving coverage through private insurance to drop that insurance in favor of Government-sponsored health care coverage. I do not think that is the way to move forward with health care reform. I do not think that policy would lower health care costs or increase the access to quality health care. Both are important goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In talking with people in my State of Florida, they want to see SCHIP reauthorized. They want to help poor children who need health care. They understand the debate we are having, and they want a better alternative than anything that is on the table right now. So we are at an impasse. But I think we can find common ground. A real compromise needs to be reached, one that keeps the spirit of SCHIP, one that adds provisions to help find children currently eligible for assistance and signs them up  for insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a compromise that does not simply broaden the program's eligibility so people in private health insurance are forced to move to Government-sponsored health insurance because an employer sees an opportunity to save money. That is why later today I will introduce an alternative SCHIP reauthorization program composed of three elements--a full reauthorization of SCHIP, a child health care tax credit, and an aggressive outreach program to ensure all children eligible for the program have the  opportunity to sign up for the insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first element enacts a full reauthorization of SCHIP, where we continue to cover children in families with incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second element of my proposal advances tax credits to families with incomes between 200 and 300 percent of the poverty level. If a family does not have insurance, a credit provides the resources necessary to go out and purchase health insurance. Families would have the ability to purchase health insurance, health care coverage tailored to their children's unique needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third element would enhance outreach for children who are currently eligible for SCHIP coverage but who are not currently enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated between 500,000 and 1.5 million children who are today eligible for SCHIP are not enrolled simply because families do not know the program is available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake: The underlying debate is not whether we are going to provide health insurance for our Nation's children. We all agree that our society can ill afford to not take care of children in need. The dispute is how are we best to achieve that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the major differences between the vetoed SCHIP program and my alternative is that the vetoed bill created a newly eligible population and moved them into a system of Government health insurance. My proposal is patient focused. It retains for families the choice of providers and practitioners and gives parents the resources necessary to add their children to their existing health care plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where our proposals are similar is in the number of children we insure. Under my proposal, 10 million children would have access to health insurance. That is the same number who would have been covered by the vetoed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential we come together as Republicans and Democrats to talk about a viable alternative, about how we can get this done, about something that would ensure the reauthorization of SCHIP and that expands rather than diminishes private health care coverage for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be willing to continue to discuss this issue in a way that allows us to debate whether in the reauthorization part of this bill--the $5 billion probably is not enough to cover all of the children who need to be insured under this program. I think a larger number than that $5 billion is necessary, probably closer to $10 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But once we did that, then how do we go about covering that 200 percent to 300 percent of poverty--those working families who still cannot find a way to insure their children without Government assistance? We would do that through a tax credit. That tax credit would also be beneficial. It would be a way of allowing them to continue to have a private health care option, which I think is always preferable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The insurance marketplace would adjust and continue to innovate in a way that I think would give us a much stronger, much better health care system for the children of America who so much need insurance for themselves and for us to be sure we have a healthy future for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the coming days  to strike a middle ground, to strike a compromise on SCHIP, to be sure we come together to let the people of America know this Congress, Republicans and Democrats, can come together to work together on something as important as the health of our children. I look forward to the days ahead, as we continue to discuss this important topic, and I look forward to having others join  this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very gratified that quite a number of the Members of the House have adopted this as their idea and are going forward with this as a plan that may have viability, may be the answer. I hope an increasing number of Senators who are now not only looking at it but also finding favor with it will create the kind of middle way that will allow us to come together to find a solution and put this important issue back where it belongs: moving forward and taking care of the children of America.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleague from Florida and many of my other colleagues in urging the sort of consensus building, practical problem solving Senator Martinez is talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear we are at a current impasse on the SCHIP debate. The version that passed the Senate and passed the Congress has been vetoed by the President. It will be made even more clear in the next day or so that veto will not be overridden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think what the American people want us to do is not talk endlessly, debate endlessly, and simply try to score political points, but to come together around a practical compromise, a practical resolution that advances health care, particularly for poor children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I join my colleague from Florida in urging us to do that. My ideas about what that reasonable, practical compromise would be are very much like his. I applaud Senator Martinez in terms of the ideas he has put forward to resolve this SCHIP debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not support the Senate Finance Committee version of the SCHIP bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not support it for a very simple reason: I am all for the SCHIP program. I am all for covering poor children. I am not for expanding that program well beyond the boundaries of poor kids so that it is a precursor, quite frankly, to government-run, government-dominated health care. I think that is a mistake. I think expanding a program such as this and actively pushing people off private insurance, which the Finance Committee version would do, is a big mistake and moves us in the opposite  direction of where we should be moving with regard to health care reform in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do I say that about the Finance Committee bill? Well, for a simple reason: It goes well beyond the original intent of SCHIP, which is to cover poor kids. It goes beyond that in several ways. First of all, it raises the general limit of eligibility from 200 percent of poverty to 300 percent of poverty. In the United States today, 300 percent of poverty is $62,000, a family income of $62,000. But, in fact, that limit is well above that in most cases. Why? Because under the Finance Committee  bill, States can define family income in innovative ways. They can take out large expenditures such as tuition from family income, so we are not talking about gross family income of $62,000. Once you take out those major components, those major sources of spending of a family, you could easily be talking about a family income of $80,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, under the bill the administration--any administration--would be urged, if not mandated, to grant waivers to States in many cases to go well above even that 300-percent-plus line. So clearly, you would dramatically expand the children and the families covered under the program, and you would go well beyond what any reasonable person would define as the truly poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why is this bad? Well, for one thing, you are crowding out folks--pushing folks off--of private insurance. There have been several analyses done of the Finance Committee bill which passed the Congress and which the President vetoed. Under those analyses of new enrollees, it is estimated that between 45 and 51 percent would be dropping private insurance to enroll in SCHIP. Now, is that the direction we want to move in, encouraging folks who have private insurance to drop it, to flee private  insurance to come under the care of the Government? I think that is the wrong direction to move in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond that, if you look at new eligibility groups--in other words, not all new enrollees, but the new groups of people who would become eligible under the bill--there is a 100-percent crowd-out effect. Everybody in those new groups would be dropping private insurance to enroll in SCHIP. Is that the direction we want to move in? I think not. We talk about the problem of the uninsured in this country. Why do we want to grow that problem versus solve it by encouraging people and helping people  keep their private insurance or get onto private coverage? That is not the direction we want to move in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the direction we want to move in is to encourage coverage, to make it more available, to make it more affordable. That is the sort of solution that Senator Martinez and myself and others have been talking about. That is why I support the McConnell-Lott SCHIP bill and support furthering the goal of health care for all American families with tax credits that can make private coverage available and affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Step 1: A real SCHIP reauthorization focused on poor kids. That is what the legislation I support does. That bill costs $8 billion in new costs over 5 years, but those new costs are fully offset. That bill would keep eligibility at 200 percent of the poverty line, but it would enroll many more new kids: 1.3 million by 2012 and 1.5 million new kids by 2017. It would also extend coverage to pregnant women and their children in the womb. That is important as well. That is a real reauthorization  of the SCHIP program as it was originally designed and intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, is that good enough with regard to children's health care needs and families' health care needs? Absolutely not. There are other needs out there which we must address. Health care insurance isn't available, isn't affordable to enough folks. But rather than encouraging them to get on a government program and in half the cases actively pushing them off private insurance, why don't we help them stay on private insurance or obtain private insurance? That is the additional step we need to take  through tax credit or other legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, I urge us to do what the American people want, which is not to simply argue, talk, debate, and try to score political points endlessly, but to come together around a real and valid and commonsense compromise. That is what the American people want, so let's do it. That compromise is clearly within striking distance if we have the political will to come together around those ideas. Again, I believe the principle we should look at is a real reauthorization of SCHIP for poor children, supplemented  with some additional help for those families that need the help to stay on or to get on private insurance. I don't believe the path of the current SCHIP bill, which actively pushes families off private insurance in so many cases, is the way to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proponents of that bill laud it because it would sign up 4.4 million new enrollees. Well, guess what: 4.4 million of that 2.4 million currently could have private insurance. Is that progress? Is that a great accomplishment, to push off of private insurance 2.4 million and get them on a government program at the expense of the taxpayer, when there is a better, cheaper alternative to help them stay on private insurance, to help them have more choice and control and autonomy of their health  care future? That is what the American people want: More control, more choice, more autonomy, making good health insurance available and affordable. Let's reauthorize SCHIP for the truly poor and let's give them ways to make health care insurance available and affordable through instruments such as tax credits.</paragraph>
