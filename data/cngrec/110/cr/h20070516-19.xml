    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we move closer to Memorial Day weekend and the summer months ahead, families in Wisconsin and across the country will be packing up their families to head off on vacation, like up north in Minocqua, Door County in Wisconsin. And once again, gas prices are hitting record highs. American families and  small businesses everywhere are bearing the full weight of the Bush administration's failure to enact a meaningful energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the President announced his most recent attempt to do something, and once again it is another insufficient and inadequate solution. This failed attempt at energy policy is a placebo. It is a fake solution to a very serious problem. There is a better way of doing things, and it begins with energy efficiency, developing renewable energy resources and moving away from fossil fuels.</paragraph>
