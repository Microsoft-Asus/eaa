    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express to the House the fear and uncertainty felt by the American people. For over a month, America has been vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Not only has the majority refused to call a vote on bipartisan legislation that would reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, they will not even let us debate this very crucial matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard from hundreds of constituents regarding this matter, and they want the Senate bill. They are fearful and angry that Congress cannot accomplish one of its principal tasks, and that is protecting the security of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, there were reports that the majority said we were too busy to add FISA to the schedule of bills. Is Congress too busy to protect the citizens of this country? We are too busy to monitor the activity of terrorists who have launched attacks on innocent civilians, and are likely to do it again? There are few things more important than protecting our Nation from terrorist activity.</paragraph>
