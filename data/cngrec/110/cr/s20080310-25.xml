    <paragraph>Mr. President, I recently visited Birch Run High School in Michigan to learn about its biodiesel project. This project is an innovative, forward-thinking endeavor, and I am proud that young people in Michigan are making strides to understand and begin to solve some of our Nation's most pressing concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biodiesel project was initiated in the second semester of the 2007-2008 school year at Birch Run by Mrs. Jan Pollard, a chemistry teacher at the school. Mrs. Pollard was instrumental in helping the school secure the funding necessary to establish this project by approaching officials associated with the Watershed Initiative Network--WIN--grant program. She wrote and submitted a proposal for $10,000 to WIN, which was ultimately approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biodiesel project is a part of a comprehensive effort that includes a greenhouse and a bee keeping component. The students currently working on the biodiesel project include Ross Fredenburg, the team leader; Derek Bentley; Ryan Johnson; and Dillon Fredenburg, the apprentice leader for the 2008-2009 school year. These students have completed all the construction work, installed the necessary equipment, and run the project, including all manufacturing and testing of the biodiesel fuel. They  obtain, at no cost, used vegetable oil from the school and from local restaurants to convert to biodiesel fuel. The project has produced approximately 200 gallons of biodiesel fuel thus far. By next year, the school expects to be able to provide biodiesel fuel for its entire 26-bus fleet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This exciting project has the support of many in the community, including Birch Run School Superintendent Wayne Wright, Birch Run Principal Mike Baszler and members of the Birch Run School Board. Mrs. Pollard and her students have tirelessly worked on the many aspects of this project. And, most importantly, these students have been provided an excellent opportunity to pursue practical and timely solutions that will benefit the school, the environment, and their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, these young people have embarked on an important endeavor. As a Nation, we must increase the diversity of our energy sources and enhance our Nation's energy independence. Biodiesel provides a part of the solution to our energy needs. It has the potential to improve our Nation's energy independence in the near term by replacing some of the oil we import from abroad with homegrown, sustainable biofuels. Utilizing this fuel source could reduce our impact on the environment and slow changes  to our climate that will otherwise threaten our future. With this new technology, we could dramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help create jobs as well as spur our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues will share my enthusiasm in recognizing everyone affiliated with the biodiesel project at Birch Run High School. I look forward to hearing about their many successes in the future.</paragraph>
