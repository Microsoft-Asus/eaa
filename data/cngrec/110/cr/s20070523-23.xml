    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Hamilton Southeastern High School's We the People class on receiving an Honorable Mention at the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution national competition held April 28 to 30 in Washington, DC. I am pleased that the members of the Hamilton Southeastern High School We the People class were among the 1,200 students from across the country who participated in this important event specifically designed to educate young people about the  U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join family, friends, and the entire Hamilton Southeastern High School community in recognizing the hard work and dedication of the following members of the Hamilton Southeastern High School We the People class: Ben Anderson, Lauren Bowser, Austin Brady, Kristin Buckingham, Jesse Hawkins, Kirk Higgins, Chris Hill, Tiernan Kane, Nika Kim, Ryan Landry, Julie Lux, Rachel Morris, Jeff Neufer, David Ostendorf, Ryan Puckett, Taylor Schueth, Matt Stein, Amy Thomas, Aleks Vitolins, and Edward Wolenty.  I also wish to commend Jill Baisinger, the teacher of the class, who committed her time and talent to prepare the students for the national competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the Indiana We the People program is also attributed to the hard work of Stan Harris, the State coordinator, and Lisa Hayes, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing this program in our state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The We the People national competition is a 3-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which the students "testify" before a panel of judges on constitutional topics. Students are able to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluate and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program is administered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the U.S. Department of Education through congressional appropriations. I am proud to note that between 2003 and 2006, Indiana had 176,653 students participate in the programs offered through the Center for Civic Education, with 8,439,873 participating nationally.</paragraph>
