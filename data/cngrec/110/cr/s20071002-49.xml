  <narrative>NOTICE OF INTENT -- (Senate - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12446">S12446</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I submit the following notice in writing: In accordance with Rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing that it is my intention to move to suspend paragraph 2 of Rule XXII for the purpose of proposing to the bill (<bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>), the Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I objected to Senator Ensign's proposed unanimous consent of September 27, 2007, to take up and vote on an amendment to <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act, which is not germane to the underlying bill and has not been reviewed by the Rules and Administration Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed Ensign amendment would require outside groups, such as advocacy and charitable organizations, that file ethics complaints to disclose their donors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His proposal to require limited debate and then a vote on the amendment before voting on <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill> could be prevent the timely passage of the underlying bill before the 2008 election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next year's presidential and congressional elections are expected to have record contributions to and expenditures by candidates for federal offices. Electronic filing by Senate candidates will provide timely reports of these activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the subject matter of the Ensign amendment would be best addressed first in the Rules Committee, where a hearing will provide an opportunity for all interested parties to express their views on this matter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
