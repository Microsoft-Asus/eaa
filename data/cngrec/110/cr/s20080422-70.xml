    <paragraph>Mr. President, on October 6, 2007, the people of Virginia's First Congressional District lost one of its most respected and admired leaders, a dedicated Member of Congress and loyal friend, Representative Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as a small tribute to her, the Senate passed <bill type="h" number="5489">H.R. 5489</bill>, which designated the United States Post Office at 6892 Main Street in Gloucester, VA, as the "Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis Post Office." Last year, Senator Webb and I introduced a companion bill, <bill type="s" number="2725">S. 2725</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following a successful real estate career, Mrs. Davis decided to run for public office in 1997. After serving as a Delegate in the Virginia General Assembly for 4 years, Jo Ann Davis became the first Republican woman to serve Virginia in the U.S. Congress after winning her election in 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From her first day in office, Congresswoman Davis was a relentless champion for the needs of the First District. It was my privilege to work with her on many matters, ranging from national defense to the environment. I always admired Representative Davis for her strong convictions and the tenacity that she brought to bear in acting on them. She fought a courageous struggle against cancer, and I will certainly miss her insights and her friendship in our Virginia Congressional Delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given her commendable public service at the Federal and State levels, I was pleased to offer this small token of recognition and gratitude for someone who had given so much to the Commonwealth and her country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleagues from the Commonwealth and from the entire U.S. Congress in expressing my deepest sympathies to her husband, her two sons, and her extended family. They continue to remain in our thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
