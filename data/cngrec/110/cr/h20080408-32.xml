    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate bill, <bill type="s" number="793">S. 793</bill>, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008, to authorize research and public health activities relating to trauma and traumatic brain injury. The version of the bill we are considering today represents bipartisan and bicameral consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="s" number="793">S. 793</bill>, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008, is to authorize funding for research, treatment, surveillance and education activities related to trauma and traumatic brain injury at the National Institutes of Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reauthorizing the traumatic brain injury program will strengthen the goal of understanding and addressing traumatic brain injury and strengthen our commitment to all  those who experience traumatic brain injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to acknowledge my friend the gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman BILL PASCRELL, for his incredible leadership in the House on this important matter. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in its support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleague in support of <bill type="s" number="793">S. 793</bill>, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008. This legislation reauthorizes important grant programs, which assist States, territories, and the District of Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated services of community-based services and support for those with traumatic brain injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traumatic brain injuries, TBI, can happen to anyone, and occur when someone experiences brain damage from externally inflicted trauma to the head. While these injuries can impact children, teenagers and adults, TBI has been described as the signature wound of the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, first authorized in 1996, was reauthorized in 2000. With the large number of troops returning from the battlefield afflicted by this injury, it is important that we continue the activities authorized by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill ensures that we are working to improve treatment through research at the National Institutes of Health and are able to gather information about the incidence of TBI and the prevalence of TBI-related disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Wisconsin. I would like to also thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Pallone for their thoughtful consideration and support for millions of TBI survivors and their families. But I personally want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Congressman Todd Platts, for his leadership on this important issue. He has shown true sensitivity, and as cochair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force,  families all through America could not have a better friend than Todd Platts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have witnessed firsthand, Madam Speaker, how these programs make a difference in people's lives. Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in young Americans, as well as being the signature injury of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every 21 seconds, one person in the United States sustains a traumatic brain injury. That adds up to 1.4 million TBIs each year. About half of these cases result in at least short-term disability, and about 50,000 people die as a result of these injuries. Eighty thousand people sustain severe brain injuries leading to long-term disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Centers for Disease Control estimates there are 5.3 million Americans who are living with long-term severe disability as a result of brain injury. The national cost is estimated at $60 billion annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statistics involving brain injury are increasing even more now that reports show that traumatic brain injuries account for 14 to 20 percent of the casualties for those who survive combat in Iraq. As of 3 months ago, Madam Speaker, 30,327 servicemembers have been wounded in Iraq. Two-thirds of those, approximately 20,000, have had injuries during this war affecting the brain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in truly a very important time in history. The brain is the last frontier of science. Many returning servicemembers suffering from TBI will receive excellent care and rehabilitation services within the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. But others suffering TBI that are initially undiagnosed or misdiagnosed will later look to the civilian community and local resources for information and services, especially those who serve in the National Guard and Reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is essential that we continue to foster collaboration between the civilian and the military, like the Department of Defense Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury. My good friend Colonel Sutton has done a fantastic job there to build a system that ensures returning troops receive what they need to put their lives back together again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, TBI remains a silent epidemic in the United States of America. That is why the legislation today, Madam Speaker, is so important. The TBI Act is the only legislation that specifically allocates Federal funds for programs supporting individuals with brain injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally passed in 1996 and reauthorized in 2000, the TBI Act represents a foundation for coordinated and balanced public policy in prevention, education and research and community living for people living with TBI and their circles of support, many times forgotten as well. It has produced results. For 10 years, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act was successfully providing direction and legal authority for the vast brain injury community in the United States. The act was not designed to provide  direct care to persons with TBI, but rather to inform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Health Resources and Services Administration grants within the TBI Act have helped States to improve access to health and other services for persons with TBI. Prior to the 1996 law, they did not have the tools to even access their own needs. Thanks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we now have a record of incidence, including details and prevalence, plans for prevention, and, finally, access to treatment. We have also begun to educate the public and provide much-needed scientific  data for our scientists, our health care providers and policymakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I cannot tell you how crucial this is to those who have TBI folks within their family. This is serious business. They have to live with it as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funds would be authorized for the fiscal years 2009 to 2012. It authorizes several new studies, including a study from the CBC and NIH to not only determine the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain injury, but to identify common therapeutic interventions and develop rehabilitation guidelines. It establishes a study in collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to identify the best methods of coordinating prevalence data in order to ensure that national research  takes into account the incidence of brain injuries among our Nation's veterans and that current information about diagnostic tools and treatments are shared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, only a strong commitment from the folks here and on the other side of this building is going to continue the incredible advances we have made in the area of basic brain research with prevention, with detection and with early treatment, physical and mental rehabilitation, long-term care and patient advocacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with many of us on both sides of the aisle. I again thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Todd Platt, for his great work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to one of the real leaders who has kept this issue moving through this Congress, Todd Platts from Pennsylvania, and I yield the gentleman 5 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 793, which, as was well delineated, reauthorizes this very important legislation, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to join with Representative Bill Pascrell in introducing the House version of this legislation, which expands support systems for individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury. As the gentleman from New Jersey referenced, for the past 3 years, I have had the privilege of serving with him as cochair of the Congressional TBI Task Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to recognize my distinguished colleague from New Jersey for his tremendous leadership and dedication related to TBI research and treatments over the course of many years. I have been delighted to serve as cochair for 3 years, but, long before that, the gentleman from New Jersey has been leading this effort and been a real champion of the importance of this work. I have been honored to work with the gentleman from New Jersey to bring awareness to the unique issues that surround TBI,  such as frequent misdiagnoses and barriers to adequate and meaningful treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans do not fully understand the amount of devastation caused by TBI each year. Most people do not realize that the incidence of TBI is greater than the incidence of breast cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis and spinal injuries combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, TBIs can manifest themselves in various manners, from a small behavioral change to complete physical disability and even death. Brain injuries affect the whole family emotionally and financially, often resulting in substantial medical and rehabilitation expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The TBI Act of 1996 produced extensive research at the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the incidence, detection and diagnosis of TBI. The time has come to better use these results and translate them into more extensive treatments. This is an important part of what Senate bill 793 aims to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to expanding the research of NIH and CDC, this legislation will build on the support systems that States have already implemented to increase the independence and productivity of individuals living with TBI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soldiers returning from Iraq have brought much-needed attention to the variety of symptoms associated with TBI. Thanks to the state-of-the-art body armor with which our men and women overseas are equipped, these heroic individuals are able to survive violent attacks while receiving blunt force to the head. Studies have found that over 60 percent of all soldiers wounded in an explosion, vehicle accidents, gunshot wound to the head or neck sustain a traumatic brain injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides additional support for States to integrate veterans into community-based treatments after these heroes return home from combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill aimed at helping individuals who, due to traumatic experiences, may never live their lives the same way again. Senate bill 793 builds on current research and support systems to help vulnerable individuals lead a more comfortable, productive and independent life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and, I, again, commend my colleague from New Jersey for his great leadership in advancing this cause.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to my colleague on the Health Subcommittee, the gentlelady from California (Mrs. Capps).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 793, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008. I want to commend the leaders of the bill in the House who have spoken already. This version of the bill we are considering today represents bipartisan and bicameral consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would fund, as we have heard, important research, treatment, surveillance and educational activities related to trauma and traumatic brain injury, commonly known now as TBI. The funding would support ongoing efforts at the National Institutes of Health, which are so important, and also the Health Resources and Services Administration and the CDC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reauthorizing this program will strengthen the goal of understanding and addressing TBI and strengthening our capacity to treat it. This current war has made us all too much familiar with the devastating effects of TBI and the importance of coordinated interventions to treat it. The war in Iraq and Afghanistan underscored the importance of this legislation, but by no means do these situations only arise in times of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that traumatic brain injury has been occurring all along with all kinds of traumas, traumas to the head and sometimes unsuspected injury that can result from other traumas. And so we need to, for a variety of reasons, pass this legislation and get this bill signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to acknowledge my friend and colleague Congressman BILL PASCRELL and also Congressman Platts from Pennsylvania. This leadership has brought us to this point. I know that our Health Subcommittee is pleased to be a part of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge, strongly, our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in supporting Senate bill 793.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="793">S. 793</bill>, the Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. <bill type="s" number="793">S. 793</bill> is the Senate companion to <bill type="h" number="1418">H.R. 1418</bill>, a bill that I cosponsored to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and improve our efforts to combat and treat traumatic brain injury, TBI, at the Federal and State levels. As a member of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, this issue is near and dear to my heart, and I am proud that we are debating this important  legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of troops wounded in Iraq 62 percent have sustained TBI, compared to a rate closer to 20 percent in previous conflicts. Overall in the U.S., there are about 1.5 million civilian cases of traumatic brain injury each year. I have worked hard to make researching and fighting TBI a priority and, in particular, the relationship between TBI and epilepsy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traumatic brain injury, TBI, causes epilepsy in up to 30 percent of civilians and 50 percent of military head injuries, greatly exacerbating chronic neurological disability. TBI is particularly problematic for soldiers currently serving or recently returned from Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, members of Congress passed the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, which amended the Public Health Service Act to increase resources available to research on traumatic brain injury. Today, we have the opportunity to reauthorize and amend this act to include a broader spectrum of traumatic brain injury programs, especially those at the State level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An expansion and improvement of our traumatic brain injury programs will serve those in  this country who suffer from the condition, while providing opportunities for research and development of programs to better prevent and detect traumatic brain injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, traumatic brain injuries affect families across America, and we must continue to invest in programs to prevent, detect, and treat these injuries. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI, is a leading cause of death and disability in young Americans. Approximately 1.4 million people sustain a TBI each year in the United States. The most common causes of TBI are falls, traffic accidents, and assault. These brain injuries result in short-term or long-term disabilities and can severely impact how people live their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress took an important step in 1996 by passing the Traumatic Brain Injury Act to promote brain injury research, education, treatment, and prevention. It is the only Federal law that specifically addresses the issues faced by persons with brain injury. This law has successfully improved access to health care and other services for individuals with TBI. Without the TBI Act, State governments and these individuals would be left to their own devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, we have seen an increasing number of traumatic brain injuries in servicemembers returning home from combat operations. The programs in the TBI Act can help the thousands of troops wounded in combat and suffering from brain injury. We have an obligation to assist these soldiers, and I am proud that Congress has provided funding in the recent appropriations bill to address TBI in returning personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act builds on the success of the original 1996 law by continuing to educate the public and provide much needed data on TBI for scientists, health care providers, and policy makers. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of National Public Health Week and the health bills that the House will debate today. It is important that we recognize and build on quality public health programs that affect every aspect of our lives--from effective childhood vaccination programs, to early screening programs for diseases, to ensuring that Americans have access to critical treatment programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to quality, affordable health care is critical to the well-being of our country, today and in the future. With 46 million uninsured--9 million of whom are children--we need to focus on strengthening the Medicare system, providing increased access to quality health care programs and ensuring that our low-income children and families have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my tenure in the Virginia General Assembly, I introduced a number of bills that focused on child and maternal health, preventive screenings for hearing and immunizations for children against certain diseases. The need for these services was vital to the health of the citizens not only of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but also to our Nation as a whole and continues to help our most vulnerable today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there continues to be an urgent need for expanded health care coverage and increased access to health care for children, seniors and low-income individuals. Because of this need, I introduced <bill type="h" number="1688">H.R. 1688</bill>, The All Healthy Children Act. The All Healthy Children Act, endorsed by the Children's Defense Fund, is a logical, smart and achievable incremental next step to close the child coverage gap and guarantees all children have access to the health coverage that they need to survive,  thrive and learn. This proposal would ensure that all children are covered by expanding the coverage of both the Medicaid and SCHIP programs while eliminating procedural red tape that currently prevents many children from being covered under either program. This comprehensive program would include all basic health care and preventive testing as well as coverage for mental health and prenatal care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bills that we will vote on today will also help to provide our medical community the tools necessary to improve lives through prevention, research and treatment of disease. For example:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program is a critical CDC program intended to identify and help infants with hearing loss. This bill reauthorizes funding and expands the program to provide screening and intervention services for young children. We know that the earlier hearing problems are identified, the more effective the medical services can be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wakefield Act is designed to improve emergency medical services for children needing trauma or critical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act educates parents and health care providers about newborn health screening, improves follow-up care for infants with an illness detected through newborn screening, and helps States expand and improve their newborn screening programs. Many diseases and conditions which can be cured when detected early can lead to permanent disabilities if not detected in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act is designed to improve the analysis of tests for cervical cancer by ensuring that health care professionals who read tests for cervical cancer are skilled in today's medical technology. It modernizes the cervical cancer testing program by requiring continuing medical education for pathologists to assess their diagnostic skills and ensure they keep up with the latest practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Keeping Seniors Safe from Falls Act launches a comprehensive preventative care program to reduce the number and severity of falls by the elderly. It directs HHS to implement directives to reduce falls, including improving the identification of seniors who have a high risk of falling; supporting education campaigns focused on reducing and preventing falls and on educating health professionals about fall risk, assessment and prevention; and conducting research to reduce falls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act will help schools deal with food allergies among their student population by requiring the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Department of Education, to develop a policy for schools on appropriate management and emergency plans for children with food allergies and anaphylaxis. The policy would be provided to schools within 1 year after enactment, and schools could voluntarily implement the policy. The bill also authorizes  HHS to award grants to local school districts to help them in implementing the policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House amendment to the Traumatic Brain Injury Act authorizes the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, to provide State grants for patients with traumatic brain injury to enter treatment and rehabilitation programs. The thousands of brain injury survivors who are returning home from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan are joining the 5.3 million similarly afflicted Americans here at home. Indeed, TBI is the leading cause of death and disability among young Americans. The legislation would require  the CDC to monitor brain injury incidents and create a reporting system to track the condition. It also directs CDC to study treatment techniques and NIH to conduct basic research to improve treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, action on these critical issues is imperative to meet the pressing health care concerns of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.</paragraph>
