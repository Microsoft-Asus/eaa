  <narrative>SOMETHING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON: OUR TAX SYSTEM NEEDS HELP -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1610]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's springtime in Washington. We're all anxiously awaiting the start of the spring baseball season, cherry blossoms, and of course April 15 when we all face the deadline for filing our Federal income tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now questions are often asked, paper or plastic, regular or decaf, conservative or liberal. Americans don't always agree and don't always see eye to eye. But there is one thing which a majority of us do agree on and agree on hands down, that our Federal tax system needs serious help. According to a 2007 Tax Foundation Study, 78 percent of Americans think the tax system needs a major overhaul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone knows the problem. Each year Americans dedicate billions of hours and billions of dollars complying with a very complex Tax Code. In fact, in 2005, the average taxpayer paid almost $1,900 per household in compliance costs. That means a taxpayer must work 6 days each year just to pay for the cost of preparing his or her Federal taxes for that year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time is precious. Time is money. Time is fleeting. Time is precious, and we never have enough for raising our families. Time is money, and valuable resources are lost that could be spent on productive activities such as growing the economy and creating jobs. Time is fleeting. And we can never reclaim those hours that we have spent complying with our very complex Tax Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all complain about paying taxes. We all complain about navigating the complex code. And the fact is, if the system was fair and simple, it would be a lot easier to follow and a lot easier to swallow. Americans don't mind paying for roads, for a strong defense, or even for health care for your grandmother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, right now, we have a situation where two families can be living side by side, earn exactly identical incomes and face a very different tax liability on April 15. The Smith family makes the same amount as the Jones family, and they're forced to pay a higher share of the tax burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Declaration of Independence states that all men are created equal. Maybe it also should say all taxpayers should be created equal, and it should apply to the tax burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Changes could be made within our existing system to improve it in the short term. Full expensing of business capital, permanently repealing the estate tax, abolishing the alternative minimum tax are a few of the possibilities. But fundamental tax reform would pay larger dividends. Just think of the jobs and economic growth that resulted when President Ronald Reagan cut the code in half back in 1986. Let's apply some of that same common sense that President Reagan used back in 1986 to streamlining  today's unruly code in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simplicity and fairness demand that we replace our current system with a single rate system that taxes income only one time. Even the National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olsen, recommended that lawmakers simplify the tax code. That was one of her recommendations in the 2007 annual report to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A faster, a flatter, a fairer tax structure would work and it's pretty simple. Tax returns could be done on a single page, maybe even on a postcard. It could be accomplished in just a few steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time me now. Multiply your income by a fixed percentage, subtract a standard deduction, and the process is over. Fourteen seconds. Gone will be the stressful hours figuring out whether your military service or your marital status will adversely affect your return. No more headaches trying to determine where the estimated tax payments go. Tax prep fees might be money spent on, I don't know, something more rewarding. Maybe a vacation, maybe a personal day off, maybe even creating a new job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A single tax rate structure would eliminate taxes on capital gains, taxes and dividends and taxes on savings because again, remember, we're going to tax income only one time. Businesses could expand and create jobs. Personal savings would increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How many times we hear it said over and over again, Americans don't save enough money. Americans don't save enough money because when they put some of their hard-earned money into savings, half of the interest earned goes away to Federal income tax. It's taxed as ordinary income. Where's the incentive in that? We ought to incent savings in this country, not punish it, not grind the saver into the dust when, in reality, if we increase savings in this country we might not face some of the problems  that we face today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the heavy corporate income tax which is currently the second highest in the industrialized world; let me say that again, the second highest in the industrialized world, companies would have less incentive to move their headquarters out of the United States and, more importantly, less incentive to offshore their earnings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent polling by American Solutions show that 80 percent of Americans favor an optional one page tax return with one rate. After all, who could complain about making something easier, especially a process that comes at a high cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Speaker Gingrich said in this body over and over again, real change requires real change. Americans agree the Tax Code is unfair and should go. Let's take a cue and translate this agreement into real change. After all, fundamental tax reform is a worthwhile goal, and this Congress, this Congress should take it up and pursue it for the benefit of the American people.</paragraph>
