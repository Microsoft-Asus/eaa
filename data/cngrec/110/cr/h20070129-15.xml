    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="h" number="49">H.R. 49</bill>, legislation naming a postal facility in Vail, Colorado, after the late Gerald R. Ford, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford helped ease a Nation during tense times. But even before he was President, he was widely known in this Chamber as a man of great integrity and openness. Although never elected to the office of President or Vice President, President Ford was appointed to mend a bruised American psyche and maneuver our country through the only Presidential resignation ever, to help end the Vietnam War, and to help ease rising inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He succeeded, and for that extraordinary service to his country his legacy should be remembered by all in our country and throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of another down payment on thanking President Gerald Ford for his legacy, a legacy that really began, flourished and was all about this body. We are recognizing Gerald Ford as the 38th President of the United States because he did spend 2 1/2  years as our President. But, uniquely, the man born in 1913 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was, in fact, a man of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his entire tenure in the House, he did not enjoy time in the majority. Yet his goal was to be Speaker of the House. He had no higher calling, never sought one, but accepted the one that was cast upon him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time that he was selected to be Vice President of the United States, we were already mired in the Vietnam War and disgrace had been brought upon the Vice Presidency. It was Gerald Ford who came in impeccably honest, undeniably a man of the people and a man who was only for the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is how he was selected, that is why he was selected, it is why the Senate and the House thought he was the only man for the job. Who would have known that just a short time, 10 months later in fact, he would find himself cast into an even larger role, another role that he did not ask for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet that was who Gerald Ford was, a man who came out of athletics and out of university to serve in the United States Navy in 1942 because it was the right thing to do. He had represented a district that would have returned him to the House to this very day if, in fact, he were still alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, he answered a call, a call that each of us in the House has answered by coming to this body. That was the call of service to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I support this naming of this post office in the place he loved, in the place he skied, in the place that he called home for his immediate period after leaving the White House, I do so as the second man of the House that we are recognizing here today, first Congressman Lane Evans and then Congressman/President Gerald Ford.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="49">H.R. 49</bill>, legislation to name the postal facility in Vail, CO, after our Nation's 39th President, Gerald R. Ford, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this bill is fitting as another means of honoring the legacy of President Ford, in large part because of his special connection to Colorado and the Vail Valley. I am pleased by the support it has received; all members of the Colorado delegation have co-sponsored the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968 then-Congressman Ford and wife, Betty, first came to Colorado with their children to celebrate Christmas and to ski in the mountains at Vail. Like many other visitors, President Ford was inspired by the beauty of the area and found a connection to the land and to the surrounding community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fords later owned a home and continued to vacation in Vail. When he became President, his vacations in Colorado helped introduce the world to the Town of Vail, and in fact, the family home was dubbed "the Western White House."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vail residents knew President Ford and his family as neighbors and friends and are proud of their long association with them. President Ford served on the board of directors of the Vail Valley Foundation. Vail also serves as the home of the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens and the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater. President Ford was beloved in Vail, where he was known to be a good neighbor, an avid golfer and a lover of the outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford will rightly be remembered for his personal warmth, his decency, his interest in bridging the many divisions in America during the 1970s. My father, Mo Udall, served in the Congress with Gerald Ford, and while they were often on different sides in political matters--so much so that my father hoped to run against President Ford in the famous election of 1976--they were united by a common view that politics should unite people. They both were firm believers that in public life one  could disagree without being disagreeable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a credo I continue to believe in, and I commend the memory of both good men to this House, an institution they loved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coloradans, especially those in the Vail Valley, have come to think of him as the first President from Colorado because he was a great ambassador for the State, who established long ties to the people of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a dedicated public servant, President Ford served honorably in his years in Congress and in the White House. Most important, when America needed someone to reassure their trust in government after Watergate, he filled that leadership role with authenticity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe President Ford's special relationship and legacy in Colorado should be appropriately recognized by naming the postal facilities in Vail, CO, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all members support the legislation today.</paragraph>
