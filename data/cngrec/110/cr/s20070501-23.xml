  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 45th annual Reno Jazz Festival. Hosted by the University of Nevada, Reno, the Festival has grown into one of the largest of its kind in the United States, with over 10,000 people attending last year's event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The competition portions are one the highlights of the festival. Musical groups and individuals from junior highs, high schools, and colleges from throughout the country are invited to participate. The festival winner and other highly acclaimed musical groups will perform at the festival's showcase on its concluding day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clinics will also be offered at the festival to help developing musicians improve their abilities and talents. Jazz students have a unique opportunity to meet with and learn from some of the most talented musicians and educators in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jazz has come a long way since I first listened to the music as a boy on the radio in Searchlight. This distinct musical form has developed from its humble origins in early 20th century New Orleans to touch music fans of all ages and backgrounds today. The personalities of the early days of Jazz continue to influence today's artists across the musical spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish the host and participants of the Reno Jazz Festival continued success in bringing Jazz to all members of the community.</paragraph>
