    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague Congressman LEE TERRY for introducing the resolution expressing heartfelt sympathy for the victims and families following the tornado that hit Little Sioux, Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 11, we were given a stark reminder of just how fragile life is. In 1 minute, the Boy Scouts at the Little Sioux Scout Ranch were attending a leadership camp, Boy Scouts undoubtedly filled with joy, laughter and achievement, all of those wonderful things that make scouting a core ideal of America. In the next minute, a tornado tore through the camp, taking the lives of 4 Boy Scouts and injuring 40 others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The four scouts who lost their lives--Aaron Eilerts from West Point, Nebraska, and Josh Fennen, Sam Thomsen and Ben Petrzilka from Omaha--were exemplary young men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the tornado struck, many other young men applied first aid to the injured and worked to free those trapped in the rubble. Clearly, the scouts lived up to their motto, "Be prepared."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may God bring comfort to the families and friends of those who lost loved ones that day.</paragraph>
