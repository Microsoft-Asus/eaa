  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 18th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We have much to celebrate on this occasion. Signed into law 18 years ago, the ADA has fundamentally strengthened our Nation with its promise of equal rights and opportunity for individuals with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can see the ADA's transformative effects on society, with our public facilities, services, transportation, and telecommunications now accessible to millions who were excluded in the past. Even though the results are easy for most of us to take for granted, they can mean the difference between exclusion and full participation for a person with a disability. The ADA has ushered in a new era of opportunity in the workplace as well. After all, this legislation was intended to prohibit discriminatory  job decisions in the same spirit of the other great civil rights laws of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ADA both reflects and reinforces our commitment to the inclusion, understanding, and acceptance of all people--no matter their ability or disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have met countless Nevadans with disabilities over the years whose stories breathe life into the ideals set forth by the ADA. They want to live, work, and pursue the American dream on equal footing with everyone else, and the ADA has paved the way for them to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, the struggles that people with disabilities continue to face show that we still have a long way to go before the ADA's promise is fully realized. Economic independence, affordable health care, and the dignity of equal treatment are still beyond the reach of too many, and poverty and isolation still afflict the majority of people with disabilities. Unfortunately, court rulings in recent years have exacerbated these challenges by narrowing the ADA's coverage contrary congressional  intent. It is time to restore the ADA to the law it was meant to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let us renew our efforts to build upon the founding principles of this landmark civil rights law. I look forward to continuing this vital work in honor of all those who fought for its passage and on behalf of everyone today who cherishes the equality of opportunity promised by the Americans with Disabilities Act.</paragraph>
