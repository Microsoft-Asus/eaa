    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008, a bill I introduced with the original cosponsor, my good friend from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters are often the first to arrive at an emergency scene and the last to leave. Whether it is putting out a house fire or a wild fire, or responding to a terrorist attack or car accident, we depend on firefighters every day. But firefighters also depend on us; they depend on the public and their elected officials to make sure that they have the resources, the equipment, and the training they need to do their job. Without those tools, we put them and all of us at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Fire Administration is an invaluable resource for our Nation's firefighters and the communities they protect. Through training, data collection, fire education for the public, and support for fire-related research and development, the USFA provides critical tools and leadership to the Fire Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fire is one of nature's most destructive forces. In 1973, when USFA was created, over 6,000 Americans died each year in fires and another 100,000 were injured. Through the leadership of USFA and others, the number of people killed by fires each year is now between 3,000 and 3,500, with approximately 16,000 people who were injured. We can all be proud of the significant reduction. However, 3,000 Americans a year is still too many, especially when so many of these deaths and injuries are from our  most vulnerable populations, children and the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Nation still suffers over $11 billion per year in direct losses due to fire, and the trend for this number is going up, not down. With statistics like these, it is clear that fire continues to be a major problem for the U.S. <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> reauthorizes this important agency for 4 years at funding levels that will enable USFA to carry out fully its mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>At a hearing with the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee held last fall, we heard the priorities of the Nation's fire service communities for USFA. This bill directly reflects their priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes the USFA to focus on the pressing challenges of fighting fires in the wildland-urban interface, and fires involving hazardous materials, as well as advanced topics of emergency medical services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back home in Arizona, one of the toughest challenges our firefighters face is wildfires in the wildland-urban interface. This is an important year for wildfires. We have had a pretty wet winter which means a great deal of shrubs and bushes have grown at lower elevations. When the summer months heat up and the vegetation dries out, those shrubs and bushes will turn into tinder that can start a fast-moving wildfire in urban areas. Those fires threaten homes and lives. Fighting wildfires in urban  areas requires special training, and I am proud that this legislation enhances fire administration training for wildland-urban interface fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters today are called upon to respond to an ever-broader range of emergencies. This authorization bill gives USFA the authority to make sure its training program keeps pace with the increasing challenges to the fire service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also addresses an important priority of the fire service in USFA, and that is to update the National Fire Incident Reporting System, or NFIRS. This system provides important data on fire events to policymakers at all levels of government. The current system is slow to report the data to the National Fire Data Center, and does not capture data on every fire, thus limiting its value to users. <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> would direct USFA to update NFIRS to a real-time reporting, web-based system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also directs the U.S. Fire Administrator to continue USFA's leadership in firefighter health and safety. Every year over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty. <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> directs USFA to educate local fire departments about national voluntary consensus standards for firefighter health and safety, and to encourage local departments to adopt these standards. This provision will help reduce the tragic loss of life the fire service suffers each year in line-of-duty deaths by promoting  good practices in a variety of fire emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also understand there have been some concerns that this provision would affect the jurisdiction of NIOSH, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. I would like to reassure my colleagues that it is not my intent for this bill to have any effect on NIOSH or any other agency of the Department of Health and Human Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> is the product of bipartisan collaboration, and is supported by major fire service organizations, including the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, National Fire Protection Association, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resources and leadership of the USFA are an essential part of the ability of the fire service to protect our cities, towns and communities. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 reauthorizes USFA's activities in training, fire education and awareness, data collection, research and standards development and promotion. This legislation also authorizes $291 million in Federal funds for fiscal years 2009  through 2012 for the USFA. This authorization level, Mr. Chairman, is consistent with previously authorized levels and it only includes a very modest growth in  funding that is capped at 3 percent in any of the fiscal years for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as the lead Republican sponsor of this legislation, I am pleased to have worked with my colleague from Arizona, Mr. Mitchell, over these past few months to bring this bill, <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this bill has gone through the regular order process. That is a refreshing phrase, Mr. Chairman, but I am certainly pleased that it went through regular order. In fact, in October, the Science Committee's Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, of which I am the ranking member, we held a hearing on reauthorizing USFA, and <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> was unanimously reported out of our subcommittee earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 27 of this year, the full committee, the full Science Committee, reported the bill after accepting both Republican and Democratic amendments that I think have improved the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission of USFA is to limit economic and life loss "due to fire and related emergencies, through leadership, advocacy, coordination and support."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This organization provides vital assistance in the areas of training, fire education and awareness, and it awards grants to a number of our local fire departments across this country. We all have them in every district of all 435 Members. These activities have made a substantial impact over the last 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that because of the work of the USFA, smoke alarms are now standard issue in residences across the country. Over a million firefighters have received advanced training, and firefighter equipment and safety continually improves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USFA should be proud of its record of achievement. However, it is also clear that certainly there are still improvements that can be made. In the last 10 years, deaths related to fires have decreased by approximately 25 percent, from nearly 5,000 in 1996 to 3,675 in 2006. Although that decrease in fire-related deaths is commendable, the United States still has one of the highest death rates from fires in the industrialized world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, despite decreases in the numbers of fires, direct damage costs are increasing and have surpassed $10 billion per year. The number of fires have gone down, but the damage from them has gone up to $10 billion per year. In an average year, Mr. Chairman, fires caused as much damage in the United States as have hurricanes. The reauthorization of USFA will allow the agency to continue to improve our preparedness and to reduce our vulnerability to fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, last year we saw wildfires that literally ravaged southern California, and we need to develop a more cohesive way of combating these fires. I am happy to see that this legislation specifically addresses the issue of fighting fires in what we refer to as an urban-wildland interface by implementing methods to better respond and prepare for fires that move from wildlands to suburban and indeed urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I am particularly pleased that this legislation now includes an amendment that I offered at full committee. It will allow the USFA administrator to perform studies related to the management of emergency medical services at the scene of a fire. Our brave firefighters, men and women, are called upon to extract victims from car crashes, building fires or collapses, and other emergencies, so it is critical that patients receive consistent care under medical direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I do not expect USFA to pursue studies into the medical care EMS patients should receive, I believe my amendment, which was accepted by the full Science Committee, will give the administrator the authority to conduct studies into training, system design, on-scene patient management while making sure to work with appropriate Federal agencies and existing medical services in these local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the current bill is an important and well-crafted step forward for the USFA, and it represents months of diligent work by both the majority and the minority members and staff of the Science Committee. I want to make sure to commend the great staff of both the minority and the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has been a bipartisan accomplishment of our committee. That is pretty much standard practice in the Science Committee, I am proud to say, Mr. Chairman. And it is being supported not only unanimously by the committee, but by a number of fire related advocacy groups, including the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the International  Fire Service Training Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the National Volunteer Fire Council, and the National North American Fire Training Directors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I could go on, but my staff didn't list any more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly want to say, Mr. Chairman, this is an outstanding bill and I urge all my colleagues to support it, <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, because this bill will enable the USFA to continue its record of achievement, as well as prepare firefighters for the challenges that they will undoubtedly face in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Gordon), the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Mitchell for yielding to me, and I want to thank him for the introduction of this important and outstanding piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend Dr. Gingrey said, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation coming out of what I hope is thought of as a bipartisan committee. I want to thank him, as well as Mr. Wu, for their work as the subcommittee chairman and ranking member. I want to thank Mr. Hall for his help in getting this bill out as the ranking member of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have passed more than 30 bills and resolutions out of the Science and Technology Committee, all of which have been bipartisan, and all but one have been unanimous. This is another one of those unanimous bills. I think that happens because we are working together to try to do it the right way. We had a good subcommittee hearing. We had a subcommittee markup, a full committee markup. When you do it that way, you get the type of third-party endorsements that Dr. Gingrey talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the endorsement of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the National North American Training Directors, the International Fire Service Training Association, and the Congressional Fire Service Institute. That is quite a lineup to demonstrate the support for this good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the members of the committee for their work as this bill was crafted. Ms. Richardson was particularly helpful in bringing her experience of firefighting from a coastal area, and made us realize that a curriculum in marine and port firefighting was important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill done the right way, and I thank all parties for their participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to place into the Record an exchange of letters between the Committee on Science and Technology and the Committee on Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 28, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN GORDON: I am writing to you concerning <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2007. Though <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> implicates the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security, I will not seek a sequential referral of this bill because I share your interest in assuring that this legislation is brought to the House floor in an expeditious manner. Agreeing to waive consideration of the bill should not be construed as the Committee on Homeland  Security waiving its jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the Committee on Homeland Security while forgoing a sequential referral of  this bill, reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this or similar legislation. I ask for your commitment to support any request by the Committee on Homeland Security for the appointment of conferees on <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> or similar legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I ask that you please include this letter and a copy of your response acknowledging the Committee on Homeland Security's jurisdictional interest in this bill and indicating your support of our agreement in the committee report on <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bennie G. Thompson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AND TECHNOLOGY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>March 28, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the consideration of <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008. I appreciate your willingness to forgo a sequential referral on this measure so that it may move expeditiously to the Floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Committee on Science and Technology has been given sole jurisdiction over every U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) bill since the USFA's creation, we recognize that the Committee on Homeland Security has an interest in <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> based on your jurisdiction over functions of the Department of Homeland Security relating to research and development (House Rule X(1)(i)(3)(E)). Research, development, and demonstration programs and projects at the Department of Homeland Security remain within  the shared jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology due to our jurisdiction over "scientific research, development, and demonstration, and projects, therefor" (House Rule X(1)(o)(14)). I acknowledge that by forgoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Homeland Security does not waive its jurisdiction. In addition, I will support any request you may make to have conferees to a conference committee on those sections of <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, or any similar legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The exchange of letters between our two committees will be inserted in the legislative report on <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> and the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 3 minutes to Mr. Pascrell, the gentleman from New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, to all of those on both sides of the aisle who made it possible for the reauthorization bill to come to the floor today, I say thank you, and all the services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Fire Administration, through FEMA, provides the leadership, the coordination, and support services for fire prevention and control, which is critical. I mean, we still lose 100 firefighters, on average, every year. That certainly is unacceptable to any of us on this floor. And we need to work even harder to make sure that our firefighters have the resources and the wherewithal to do the job we ask them to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you remember the Fire Act we passed before 9/11, this was a response to the very basic needs of the 32,000 fire departments throughout the United States and the one million firefighters. That legislation broke ground because it was a response to needs that we've neglected. We can't expect that every local community in this country has the resources to supply and provide the training and the state-of-the-art equipment to the fire departments throughout America, and so that Fire Act has been  so successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is literally $3.5 billion in applications in the Fire Act, and a tremendous amount of applications for SAFER every year. And we have devised, both of us, on both sides of the aisle, probably the best format of how to judge the competitive applications. We've asked the firefighters to step up to the plate, judged by their peers. But the Fire Administration is partner with all of these peer firefighters who review the applications. In the Fire Act and SAFER bill, this is very unusual, the  money goes directly to the departments so that the States cannot skim and the local government cannot skim. So, this is a real competition, and I believe that's how all Federal funds should be used. That's my own personal opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fire Administration has been a true partner for 34 years. The roles and responsibilities of the fire service have evolved for the 1.1 million men and women in fire and emergency services, over 316,000 career firefighters, almost 317,000, and the 824,000 volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am so thankful for, in terms of the U.S. Fire Administration, Mr. Chairman, is that the U.S. Fire Administration has brought the volunteers and the career firefighters together. This is invaluable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I cannot express how important this is. All the competition that existed before 2000, we've gotten out of it, and thanks to the Fire Administration. They are working together, the career firefighters and the volunteer firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very important legislation that is going to save lives. And isn't this what we're here for, to do what we can on a Federal level, realizing it's always going to be the local efforts that are going to be most important. But we have a responsibility, and it seems to me today, Mr. Chairman, that we're stepping up to the plate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Members on both sides, the good doctor and my good friend from the Southwest part of the country. This has brought us together, this legislation, and it is good legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412253" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support today of <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, which is the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization of this vital legislation demonstrates Congress' commitment to enhance the protection of our citizens throughout this great Nation to prevent any harm that might come to loss of life or property due to devastation caused by fires. Included in this legislation is an amendment that I offered at a full committee markup that I'd like to reiterate and clarify at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inclusive in <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> is an amendment that does not create a new stand-alone course regarding port and marine firefighting. In fact, much effort was taken by my staff, the Republican side, committee staff, as well as the various agencies, to ensure that we would take conscious action in not creating additional costs for the agencies and/or programs that are right now really not funded to the levels we would like to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intent of the amendment is to take the unique content of port and marine firefighting activity and to incorporate that information into existing classes. Why, you might ask? This Congress' goal of using, in an efficient manner, resources that we have, we also want to integrate information to best prepare our firefighters to respond to disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you might ask the question, why? In the United States alone, we have over 126 shipping ports, all of which are critical to the movement of goods and the general health of our economy. The volatility of the products that are being shipped and the new increased size of these shipping vessels causes problems to our firefighters in terms of responding. So, when you consider a district such as mine that borders along the Port of Long Beach and also the Port of Los Angeles, one of the things that  we learned in the wake of Katrina, we learned in the San Diego fires, and we also learned with September 11th is that firefighters are brothers and sisters. You might have rural firefighters who respond to an urban disaster; likewise, urban firefighters might be called to respond to a rural disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, one of the things that we've learned in these incredible complex disasters that we've had over the last couple of years is that inoperability, the  ability for rural and urban firefighters to have the same information and to be prepared in the midst of a disaster because it's one thing to play Monday night quarterback when everything can be planned in advance, but when we have a disaster, it is too late at that point for our firefighters to be  trained on how do you respond to an extended vessel, or how do you respond to an LNG disaster, or how do you respond to anything else that might be occurring. And so, with that, it is my pleasure to work with, we had great leadership by Mr. Mitchell here in this effort of the reauthorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we never know what our firefighters might be facing, I, unfortunately, lost a firefighter in California just last week. So, I would be remiss at this moment not to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Representative Bartlett and Representative Rohrabacher, for their support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I intend, through conference with staff and the appropriate members of the Department of Homeland Security, USFA, and the Superintendent of the Fire Academy to ensure that we have the right curriculum that can be incorporated that can benefit all firefighters to ultimately protect our citizens in a better way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to again commend our colleague, Representative Mitchell, for his leadership on this issue, and also Chairman Gordon for his commitment on the Science and Technology Committee to move beyond all of the limits and the challenges that we have, and to make sure that Americans are protected every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to Mr. Wu, the gentleman from Oregon. He is the chairman of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee. And I want to thank Chairman Wu for moving this bill so quickly through the subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to recognize the leadership of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell) for working diligently on this important piece of legislation, for reaching across the aisle and working with the gentleman from Georgia, and for his leadership in shaping this important piece of legislation. In fact, it was, indeed, through efforts like this that Congress first formed the United States Fire Administration in 1974 because of then reports that there are over  12,000 deaths each year in this country, and over 300,000 fire injuries. And through the hard work of the USFA, and others, we have been fortunate to see that number drop dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now a much safer Nation thanks to improved awareness of fire safety practices, increased use of smoke detectors and sprinklers, and other fire safety measures. Still, about 3,000 people die each year of fires, and 10,000 more are injured. We also still see too many firefighters die in the line of duty. And I want to recognize Mr. Pascrell, the gentleman from New Jersey, for his diligent work over many years to decrease that unconscionable number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot more work to do. The USFA supports local fire departments in a variety of ways. It offers training and career development to thousands of mid-level firefighters, fire chiefs, and other emergency management officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USFA is a great way for the Federal Government to help coordinate efforts for local firefighters. USFA also develops fire education and awareness curriculum material to be used in training citizens across the country. It aims these messages at groups which suffer the highest fire casualties, such as the young and the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Congress is working to reauthorize and build on this program, the President, unfortunately, is cutting the budget for USFA. Indeed, the President's fiscal `09 budget cuts USFA by more than 5 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As firefighters learn to respond to new issues, such as fires and the wildland-urban interface, terrorist events and harmful materials incidents, we need to provide sufficient funds to train and prepare them for these situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters risk their lives every day so that they can protect ours. Passing this legislation is one way that we can not only show, but tangibly demonstrate our deep appreciation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on the underlying bill. I again recognize the leadership of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time, I am pleased to yield to the ranking member of the full committee, the Science Committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall). I yield to him as much time as he might consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I won't take all that much time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've heard it said that water and fire are wonderful friends and fearful enemies, and I'm sure that's been said a lot of times today. And we know the terrible devastation that both of these can bring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thousands of people die in the United States every year due to fire, and many more are injured. The total would be even higher if it weren't for the dedication and the service of our Nation's fire men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how you can say enough about our Nation's firefighters. I would say this: It's kind of a shame that it took a 9/11 for people to really fully appreciate firefighters and men and women that defend us and defend our property and our lives. I just think they're treasures of the country, and it's good for this Congress to honor them every chance we get. And that's why I'm very pleased that the Committee on Science and Technology has taken the time to deliberate and produce a bill that  will greatly contribute to the effectiveness of the United States Fire Administration, and by extension, the local men and women who serve us so very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank the gentlemen from Arizona and Georgia for their leadership on this bill, as well as the rest of the colleagues on the committee for their work. And I, of course, urge passage of <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> and yield back the balance of my time after once again saying that it's unusual that it would take some kind of devastation like we had in our sister State over here to really bring the full appreciation of men and women who, day and night, face the fires and face protection of our property  and our goods. I'm honored to be a part of recognizing them and saying to them one more time from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you, we appreciate what you're doing, and we look forward to the fact that you're going to be able to continue to do it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to Mr. Matheson, the gentleman from Utah.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400255" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, once again the Science Committee brings to the House floor a bill that makes sense, that was developed in a bipartisan way. It's a great tradition of this committee, and I think Members on both sides of the aisle on that committee know what a great committee it is to work on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank Congressman Mitchell, in particular, for taking the lead on this issue, because his approach really fits into the Science Committee approach about how we look at issues, and we try to work together in a bipartisan way to make progress. And that's why I'm happy to stand up and offer my support for this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the grand scheme of things, one of the reasons why I think this is incredibly important is that the United States has one of the highest fire-related death rates among all industrialized nations. Think about that. With all the technology we have in this country, all the safety measures, we still rank so poorly among industrialized nations in terms of fire-related deaths. And this legislation takes a step in terms of trying to address that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I come from a western State, the State of Utah; and in the West, we have particular danger in terms of forest fires. This legislation fully funds the National Fire Incident Reporting System, which is going to help the U.S. Fire Administration prevent future forest fires. Currently, we're only able to capture data from 50 percent of wildfires, which just is not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By improving the incident reporting system, the U.S. Fire Administration  will be able to speed up the reporting data, generating a more comprehensive database. In practical terms, that's going to mean better analysis, greater fire prevention, and fewer lives lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, in particular, this bill, if enacted, will expand the program to include training in wildland-urban interface areas. And this is an issue that's particularly important in western States where, as population growth has taken place, there has been greater development of housing that's moved more into where the forest exists; and that's a critical problem during these wildfire incidents is how we deal with fire issues in that very sensitive area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of my congressional district faces this problem, and my congressional district is not unusual compared to most of the West. I believe better training in terms of this wildland-urban interface will be a huge asset to Fire Departments in similar areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Mr. Chairman, I want to again thank you for your leadership on this issue. I thank Chairman Gordon and ranking member HALL. I thank Chairman Wu from the subcommittee. I thank Congressman Mitchell for his leadership. I know Mr. Gingrey's been a leader on this issue as well. And again, the Science Committee, as usual, comes up with a bill that makes sense. I'm sure it will be adopted today, and I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if I might ask my good friend from Arizona how much time, first of all, does he have left, and does he have additional speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Arizona, the time remaining for him is 8 minutes. And the gentleman from Georgia, the balance of time remaining for him is 20 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412187" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you. We have some additional speakers that are on their way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>At this point, Mr. Chairman, I will continue to reserve the balance of my time. But if the gentleman needs some time from our side, we will be glad to yield it to him.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412187" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you. Mr. Chairman, we do have a couple more speakers. They are on their way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if I may, I appreciate the good words that people have come and said before this body. We've made significant strides in reducing fire-related deaths and injuries since Congress first created this agency in the 1970s. But again, as we've noted, and all the speakers have noted, there are still more than 3,000 Americans that die every year from fires, and many more injured. And despite the decreases in the number of fires, the cost, as we said, is continually rising. And, in fact,  it's roughly the same cost, the damage of fires is roughly the same cost as caused by hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the Fire Service provides critical assistance in protecting our communities from emergency events. From house fires to terrorist events to natural disasters, firefighters, as we've noted, are not only the first on the scene, but many times the last to leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the wildfires in California last fall demonstrated, the Fire Service plays a vital role in protecting our communities, and that's why we introduced <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, to reauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration and provide additional resources for our Nation's firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Fire Administration is an invaluable resource for over 1.3 million firefighters and emergency personnel around the country. Through training, educational materials, data collection and other services, the USFA provides tools and leadership to firefighters and communities that they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> will reauthorize the USFA, funding its critical work until the Fiscal Year 2012. This bill will ensure that our firefighters are trained to handle modern-day challenges facing today's first responders, including, as we have mentioned before, firefighting in the wildland-urban interface and responding to hazardous material incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is supported by, and we've listed a whole list of these before, all of these national associations that deal with firefighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the product of bipartisan collaboration and had considerable input from the Fire Service community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We encourage you to help support firefighters in your district by ensuring that everyone has the resources they need by supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I will yield to myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was recently in Iraq. I've been a number of times, of course, to Iraq, and Afghanistan. And also just recently, I saw a news special back home highlighting one of our great heroes from the Middle East who was burned severely. His injuries, I think, were the result of an improvised explosive device, and he was an occupant of one of the up-armored HUMVEES or the new MRAP vehicles. I think, indeed, it was an up-armored HUMVEE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while he was not injured by shrapnel or a projectile, there was a fire, and there was a significant fire. And of course, as he was pulled from the burning vehicle, he sustained severe, severe injuries to his person from the fire. And he described how he just, he knew what to do. He rolled, he tried everything in his power. But of course, thanks to what happened to him at Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany, and then eventually at Walter Reed and Bethesda, he's alive and well and has a family  and children. And this little news clip featured him playing with his kids. But you could certainly see the ravages that that fire inflicted upon his body, and the scarring of course. What a brave--I wish I could remember his name, Mr. Chairman, because it was, talk about a profile in courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it just made me think about, as we've been discussing here today, and you talk about what these firefighters do and how important they are. And actually, as we know, 40 percent of the workload in Operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom has been carried by our Guard and Reserve, many of whom are firefighters who, you know, they've been trained. And thank God for that. And I'm very hopeful. I want to look into this further. I'm sure that our military, our regular Army and Marine Corps, they're  all well-trained in that. But that just goes to show you how important it is, not just to save a life, but try to bring that life back and so they can rejoin their family and friends in society, go back to their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the statistics that I think both Mr. Mitchell and I mentioned in regard to the fact that the latest year that we had numbers, there was still something like 37, 3,800 people that lose their lives every year in fires in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, you know what? That's about the number, we're at 4,000 now, that have lost their lives in this 4 1/2 , 5-year war. And of course there were practically 3,000 lives lost, many of them from fire, a lot of them firefighters themselves, on 9/11. So it just brings home the message that fire is an awful thing. It is an awful thing. It might not kill you immediately, like one of these high powered projectiles, but it can certainly destroy one's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what we're talking about here today is so important, and that's why this bill is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to make those remarks, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, at this time, don't have additional speakers waiting for time, but I would like to reserve the balance of my time. And I still make the offer to yield to the gentleman from Arizona if he needs some more minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412187" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would, again, like to yield as much time as he may consume to Mr. Wu, the gentleman from Oregon, who is the chairman of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee. I, again, want to thank him for all the efforts he's put into this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again, I would like to recognize the leadership of the gentleman from Arizona for working so hard on this important legislation, this legislation which was developed in regular order in both subcommittee and full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Georgia, my ranking member, we held hearings last October at the subcommittee level, and then we had a full committee markup, and the bill was drafted in full consultation with both majority and minority members and majority and minority staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been made of the work that will be done on the wildland-urban interface and the fuel loads and the biomass loads there, and the hazardous  materials, and that is very, very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to draw attention to the sections of the bill that directs the USFA to educate local fire departments about voluntary consensus standards for firefighters health and safety. And many fire groups, especially the National Association of Firefighters, very strongly believe that adherence to these standards can help reduce the number of firefighters who die each year in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill has been endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the North American Fire Training Directors, the International Fire Service Training Association, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute; and I would like to specifically thank all of the firefighters from home in Oregon who helped me  with this legislation in shaping it and bringing it to this point on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, I would again like to commend the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell) for his leadership on this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I will continue to reserve my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412187" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. I will not consume much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to applaud the work of the Science and Technology Committee on reauthorizing this program that has been remarkably effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fire is remarkably destructive, but we have made great strides under this program. In 1973, there were more than 6,000 Americans who died each year in fires, another hundred thousand were injured. Largely because of this program and the training and other support, we are now about to the point where about 16,000 a year are injured and between 3,000 and 3,500 die each year. That is obviously still too much, but is remarkable progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And among the most dangerous work that anyone can do is fighting fires. The number of deaths each year among firefighters is a large number, and even more are injured every year. A great many firefighters never complete their term of service before qualifying for retirement because they suffer from disabling injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does provide for additional training for fighting fires, particularly where wild areas come into contact or where urban areas and wildland areas meet. It helps training for fires that involve hazardous materials as well as giving advance training in emergency medical services. And it does, as Mr. Wu just pointed out a moment ago, provide for moving towards a voluntary consensus for firefighters' health and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will help reduce that number of firefighters who die each year and who suffer from grievous injuries in doing very courageous work in protecting us and protecting our property.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Chair will remind the gentleman from Arizona he has 1 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would rise today in strong support of the underlying bill which reauthorizes one of the most effective agencies in the Department of Homeland Security. <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> provides $70 million annually to the Fire Administration through 2012 to ensure long-term funding stability for this critical agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Mitchell, and the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon, for their leadership on this issue and for working with me to bring this legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the statistics are sobering. Every year, over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty. In 2005, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,675 civilian deaths, nearly 18,000 civilian fire injuries, and over $10 billion in direct losses due to fire. The United States Fire Administration plays a critical leadership role in leading local fire departments to dramatically reduce these numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I, along with all of the other speakers who have come before you in support of this legislation, encourage its passage.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I will continue to reserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How much time do we have, Mr. Chairman?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> At this point in time, the gentleman from Arizona's time has totally expired. The time remaining for the gentleman from Georgia is 16 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>I would be happy, Mr. Chairman, if the Chair would allow, to yield up to 5 minutes for the gentleman from Arizona to close. But I want to make my closing remarks, of course, before that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> After the gentleman from Georgia concludes his remarks, he may then yield time to the gentleman from Arizona.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To close on my side, again, let me just simply say as I did before, it has been a great pleasure to work with Mr. Mitchell on this bill. It has been an even greater pleasure to meet with the many firefighters and fire chiefs who I have consulted with over the past few months: our own fire chiefs in my county and city, Cobb County, Georgia; Marietta City, Georgia; Chief Jackie Gibbs, Chief Becky Dillenger. I see them literally every week in the district and the great work that they do,  and it makes me awfully proud to be up here representing not only them but the other eight counties in my district. They know that we are fighting to help them protect us, and that's a comforting feeling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> is a very good bill. And this is the least that we, in this body, can do to support our Nation's fire services. And I want to again say I hope that we will have as many Members that are present today, close to 430, I hope, voting "yes" for 4847 to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I am prepared to yield as much time as the gentleman from Arizona needs for the purpose of his closing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412187" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And first, I would like to thank Mr. Gingrey and all of his staff for the support they've given this important piece of legislation. And it's the least we can do, here in Congress, to provide the resources necessary for our first responders to react, the education that's involved, the training, particularly in areas that are very important, like in Arizona and California where there is a wildfire/urban interface.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, we have had a very wet winter in Arizona. It's good and bad. It brings out the wild flowers; it brings out a lot of green. But at the same time, in the lower elevations it brings out a lot of dry tender which just really is very dangerous this time of year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like to thank everyone, the staffs on both sides, the committee chairman, the subcommittee chairman, everyone who dealt with this particular issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I, again, want to thank all of the firefighters, the professional people who are involved, who gave us what they felt is necessary to move this bill forward and to give them the tools that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This piece of legislation will last until 2012. At that time, of course, we will have more input. Hopefully, we won't have as many disasters or types of disasters, but there will be new things that we need to learn and train for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate, again, everyone's efforts in this, and I know that the people around this country who are protected by these first responders also appreciate what we are doing for them today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>

  <chair>In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part A of House Report 110-563. That amendment in the  nature of a substitute shall be considered read.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:</chair>
  <chair> Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The loss of life due to fire has dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United States. However, the United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. For 2006, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,245 civilian fire deaths, 17,925 civilian fire injuries, and $11,307,000,000 in direct losses due to fire.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Every year, over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty. The United States Fire Administration should continue its leadership to help local fire agencies dramatically reduce these fatalities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Members of the fire service community should continue to work together to further the promotion of national voluntary consensus standards that increase firefighter safety.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial support to the Nation's 30,300 fire departments through training, data collection, fire awareness and education, and other activities for improving fire prevention, control, and suppression technologies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and emergency responders to identify and develop responses to emerging hazards. Improving the United States Fire Administration's data collection capabilities is essential for accurately tracking and responding to the magnitude and nature of the Nation's fire problem.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) The research and development performed by the Federal Government and non-government organizations on fire technologies, techniques, and tools advance the capabilities of the Nation's fire service to prevent and suppress fires.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The United States Fire Administration is one of the strongest voices representing the Nation's fire service within the Federal Government, and, as such, it should have a prominent place within the Federal Government.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 17(g)(1) of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2216(g)(1)) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking "and" after the semicolon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end and inserting a semicolon; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) by adding after subparagraph (D) the following new subparagraphs:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2009;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(F) $72,100,000 for fiscal year 2010;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(G) $74,263,000 for fiscal year 2011; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(H) $76,490,890 for fiscal year 2012.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4.

    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in the reauthorization act of 2008, this amendment provides that the National Fire Academy training program could train fire service personnel in response tactics and strategies for dealing with natural catastrophes, including terrorist-caused national catastrophes and incidents that involve weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the cosponsor of the underlying bill, Representative Harry Mitchell from Arizona, for presenting a very strong piece of legislation that will reauthorize the United States Fire Administration for another 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the chairman of the Science Committee, Congressman Gordon, for his leadership in considering all of the necessary elements of this legislation with the end result being a strong, comprehensive bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill would authorize $293 million through fiscal year 2012 for the U.S. Fire Administration, which is a vital agency charged with reducing debt and economic losses because of fire emergencies. I want to make clear that this is a small price to pay when considering the thousands of lives we lose each year to fire emergencies and the billions of dollars we spend to fight them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my years in Congress, I have always been passionate for funding our Nation's fire departments and firefighters, the Fire and Safety grants that this Congress has provided in the funds supplied through this reauthorization. I feel especially strong about this reauthorization because it also includes provisions that help guide the fire academy on how to best train our Nation's firefighters for the added and the increased challenges they face every day. My amendment addresses this issue  by simply updating the training program at the National Fire Academy to include national catastrophes related to terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw on 9/11 our Nation's heroic firefighters were among the first responders on the scene trying desperately to rescue as many people as possible in that horrific act of terror. Clearly, we all understand that the responsibilities of our Nation's firefighters became greater on that day as they now have to train for emergency response to catastrophic terrorist attacks, including the foreboding threats of incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Many of these types of courses already  exist at the fire academy, but the future of these critical courses for these firefighters should never be put in doubt and need to be codified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment simply puts these practices into law and sends a message to the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Fire Administration that this issue continues to be important to the Congress and the protection of our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the sponsor, Mr. Mitchell, the chairman, Mr. Gordon, once again for all of their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the men and women of our Nation's fire services are among the very first responders to an extraordinary wide range of accidents, injuries, and disasters. And the gentleman from New Jersey, he knows as well as anybody in this body. He was right there. His district's right there, very close to the scene of 9/11. And I think that his amendment is very, very appropriate because this was a fire caused by a terrorist attack. Unlike the Murrah Building attack at Oklahoma City,  which was an incidence of domestic violence by our own, if you will, homegrown terrorists, this situation that occurred on 9/11 is the reason why I'm sure the gentleman from New Jersey has brought forth this good amendment. And he is so right to point out that firefighters will also be the first to the scene when many of these catastrophes happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, it won't occur in this country again. We've been blessed. I think there has been a lot of hard work on the part of this Congress and this administration to protect our country on our soil from another terrorist attack. Thank God so far it hasn't happened. But that doesn't mean you don't  train for and prepare for it. And those firefighters that went to work that day, they were well trained, but I'm sure they weren't expecting a terrorist attack.  And in such an event like that, their first job, of course, always is to heroically save lives. But fire services will also act to minimize the damage and property loss that a terrorist strike or ensuing events may cause. I mean, as the amendment addresses, there may be biological weapons of mass destruction, and there could have been, right behind the two planes, maybe another plane with a terrorist coming into the city</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm proud of the U.S. Fire Administration's work to date to improve our resiliency and our preparedness, yes, for terrorist events, natural disasters, and, of course, the daily accidents and fires that occur in communities across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I wholeheartedly support the gentleman's amendment. I urge all my colleagues and expect all my colleagues to support his amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it now gives me a tremendous sense of honor to introduce also the gentleman from Mississippi, my good friend, who is also the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend, a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Pascrell. The gentleman from Paterson, New Jersey, is a leader on the committee and in Congress on first responder issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former volunteer firefighter and graduate of the Mississippi Fire Academy, I understand that many firefighters are unable to travel to the National Fire Academy's campus in Maryland to partake in training. The Fire Academy recognizes this need. By harnessing technology, the Fire Academy partners with existing local and State training academies to reach more first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pascrell amendment addresses one key area of training: terrorism response training. Specifically, the amendment seeks to ensure that fire service personnel get training on response tactics and strategies for dealing with "terrorist-caused national catastrophes and incidents that involve weapons of mass destruction." Such incidents can be very complex and require response from many public safety agencies across multiple jurisdictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Fire Academy has a terrorism curriculum in place. The Pascrell amendment will ensure this continuation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been nearly 7 years since the attacks of 9/11, and, thankfully, we have not been attacked since. However, Mr. Chairman, the threat is still very real. As Members of Congress, it's our collective responsibility to ensure that responders in our communities are fully trained, equipped, and staffed to answer the question call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I encourage my colleagues to support the Pascrell amendment as well as the underlying bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, firefighting is a high-risk, high-consequence activity, and the agencies that are involved in managing wildland-urban interface have always had strong firefighter safety and training programs. Firefighter safety is their highest priority. In fact, the 1995 Federal Fire Policy sets the order of priorities for wildland firefighters as, number one, public and firefighter safety; number two, protection of resources; number three, protection of property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The safety, health, and welfare of firefighters and the general public are becoming increasingly linked to the decline in the health of forested ecosystems. The most effective means of reducing burgeoning fire suppression costs, protecting community values, restoring forest and grassland health, and improving firefighter safety is an aggressive fuel treatment program. How land managers apply the fuels reduction program will have the greatest impact on the safety of wildland firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Threats to human life are compounded by the fact that more and more people are living in homes near fire-prone forests, placing themselves and the firefighters who try to protect them at greater risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment allows the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration to develop and distribute information on the importance of clearing biomass from Federal lands. This commonsense amendment requires USFA to work in consultation with other Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the BLM to ensure that USFA provides the best possible recommendation. As we come upon what many are predicting to be another deadly and costly fire season, this information will be as vital as  ever. We must provide our Federal employees, who are the best in the world, all the tools they need to keep our communities and themselves safe from catastrophic wildfires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal hazardous fuels reduction program can be a very good thing for wildfire fighters. If it is done properly, the program can reduce the most extreme of the hazardous fuels and make the working environment for wildland firefighters much safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has invested millions of dollars in a hazardous fuels reduction program to mitigate the risks, costs, and consequences of wildfire across millions of acres of publicly owned wildlands. The knowledge gained as to relative effectiveness of different types of treatments and the overall effectiveness of those treatments will have much greater value for protecting and promoting firefighter safety when that information is shared. The United States Fire Administration should be  an important vehicle for disseminating this information, and this amendment will help to make that a reality.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in this decade, wildland fires have consumed 50 million acres in this country. While the term "wildland fires" brings to mind uninhabited areas in our Nation's parks, forests, and rural areas, wildland fires have done tremendous damage to urban and suburban development as well. I think that was the reason for the colloquy between Mr. Wu from Oregon and Mr. Sali from Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last fall, western States were hit particularly hard by wildland fires that encroached into developed areas and destroyed homes, businesses, and livelihoods. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Idaho addresses that concern. The amendment allows the Administrator of the USFA to distribute information on the importance of clearing in these areas biomass materials from Federal lands, not out in the interior of a National Park. That was a point that was made in the colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment requires USFA to work in consultation, of course, with other Federal agencies to ensure that USFA provides the best possible recommendations. Removing hazardous fuels, biomass materials, from Federal forests and lands will help to prevent, and more importantly, to limit these forest fires as they begin to encroach on urban areas. So if you leave these materials susceptible to forest fires, the consequences, as Mr. Sali pointed out, can be disastrous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chairman, I support wholeheartedly his amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

  <chair>Part B amendment No. 3 offered by Mr. Langevin:</chair>
  <chair> At the end of the bill, add the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 10. SUPPORTING THE ADOPTION OF FIRE SPRINKLERS.</chair>
  <chair> Congress supports the recommendations of the United States Fire Administration regarding the adoption of fire sprinklers in commercial buildings and educational programs to raise awareness of the importance of installing fire sprinklers in residential buildings.&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 1071, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce an amendment that highlights the critical importance of deploying fire sprinklers in all commercial buildings. My amendment encourages the installation of fire sprinklers in commercial buildings and supports educational programs about installing them in residential buildings as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years ago, a tragedy struck in my home State of Rhode Island when a fire tore through the Station Nightclub in West Warwick. It was certainly a terrible awakening for all of us about the importance of fire safety. That fire, which killed 100 people and injured 200 more, could have been prevented, Mr. Chairman, if fire sprinklers had been installed throughout the building. Almost every Rhode Islander knows someone whose life was changed forever by that terrible night, and we all learned a  very hard lesson on the importance of installing fire protection equipment in our homes, workplaces, our schools, and recreational buildings. I hope that with a renewed focus on installing fire sprinklers and other safety devices, that we can prevent a tragedy like the one in West Warwick from ever occurring again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that fire sprinklers save lives. In fact, the National Fire Protection Association has no record of a fire killing more than two people in a public building equipped with a fully operational automatic fire sprinkler system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, to this end I have introduced a piece of legislation called the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act, <bill type="h" number="1742">H.R. 1742</bill>, which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide an incentive to business owners for retrofitting existing buildings with lifesaving sprinklers. This legislation, which right now has 114 cosponsors, will reduce the tax depreciation time for retrofitting sprinklers in nonresidential real property from 39 years down to only 5. So a significant time reduction. Again, from 39 years down  to only 5 years for this tax depreciation to take advantage of the retrofitting of sprinklers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it's clear that fire sprinklers save lives, Congress has to date not taken a position on the importance of this important technology. So I believe that it is critical that we lend our voice to this issue and hopefully save another community from ever experiencing the devastating losses that West Warwick did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while we may not always be able to prevent fires from occurring, we certainly can minimize the damage they cause and the lives that they take. My amendment that I am offering today is a sense of Congress, and takes us one step closer toward that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I strongly support reauthorizing the United States Fire Administration, and I would like to commend Chairman Gordon for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. This bill will allow the U.S. Fire Administration to continue to provide support services for fire prevention, firefighter training and education, and emergency medical services activities. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment as well, <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim time in opposition. However, we are very supportive of the gentleman's amendment, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, millions of United States houses today contain smoke alarms. They have been credited with saving thousands of lives. Yet, smoke alarms can only warn the occupants of a fire. They cannot contain or extinguish a fire. Fire sprinkler systems provide the means to limit fire growth and therefore save lives and property. We already mentioned $10 billion a year, I think, in property damage, 3,600 lives lost every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies by the USFA have shown that the installation of residential fire sprinkler systems could save thousands of lives and millions of dollars in property taxes. Bottom line. So together with their Federal partners, USFA has reported a potential 82 percent reduction in fire deaths if fire sprinklers, along with smoke alarms, were installed in all residential dwellings. With the cost of a home sprinkler system in new construction being estimated as low as $1.50 a square foot, or as low as 1  percent of the total cost of the house, and of course, many insurance companies offering discounts up to 15 percent on houses that contain sprinkler systems, it is clear that the benefits in lives and property saved far outweigh the costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment from the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) supports the efforts of the U.S. Fire Administration to improve the awareness of the effectiveness and availability of residential sprinkler systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I wholeheartedly support the gentleman's amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his supportive comments and look forward to working with him on passage of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. Langevin for all of his critical work on this too often neglected issue of fire sprinklers. I applaud this amendment for encouraging the installation of fire sprinklers in all commercial buildings and supporting educational programs about installing them in residential buildings. A very critical issue here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must take every opportunity to promote the use of fire sprinklers, as the gentleman from Georgia just pointed out, which is why we introduced the Campus Fire Safety Legislation to require mandatory responses. Every university now, every college, every community college, whether it is a college building or a dormitory, any building connected to that university or institution has an obligation to tell the parents and the students what is their record on fire safety. No students should be sent  to any university, any university or any college, unless their parents and they themselves know what the record is, if there are sprinklers installed, if there are smoke detectors installed. We lost three who were killed in the Seton Hall fire in New Jersey, 58 were injured. Since 2000, 108 people have died in campus fires. There are 20 campus-related fire deaths in the last 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to bring the attention to everyone on this as part of the educational process. I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for introducing this amendment. It makes sense, and I hope everybody will support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill importantly recognizes the role and sacrifices of firefighters. And, yes, it is our firefighters who often volunteer to help protect our greatest asset, our children, yet they face a growing threat of liability lawsuits related to the proper installation of car seats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, nearly 2,500 children under the age of 14 die in car accidents, and more than 200,000 are injured in motor vehicle accidents. In 2005, half of those who died were not restrained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Institute of Highway Safety, children that are restrained in child seats have an 80 percent lower risk of fatal injury. The good news is that we are doing better as a country in using child seats and saving lives. This may have something to do with the fact that all 50 States and the District of Columbia now have child restraint laws on the books. Yet it is estimated that 25 percent of kids are still not restrained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are making great progress in ensuring child safety seats are used to protect our Nation's greatest asset. However, even though more children are using child safety seats, improper installation or improper use of a child safety seat can have the same fatal consequences. As a new mom, this is a scary reality, and, like many new parents, I fear that we haven't installed our child safety seat properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent study in six States on the misuse of child restraint systems concluded that nearly 75 percent of child seats had at least one critical misuse. In an effort to reduce the misuse of child safety seats, many fire departments send personnel to a 32-hour 4-day course on their proper installation and use. Once these personnel have been trained, they are able to provide inspection services or advice on a voluntary basis regarding the proper installation and use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When my husband and I had Cole last year, we were advised to have a fire department ensure our seat was properly installed. But I have also heard the stories of people being denied by their local fire department due to liability concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One example was in Eaton Rapids, where new parents, John and Carol Doyle, like many parents, were nervous about the new responsibility for the health and safety of their new baby, and it began with that first ride home from the hospital. They had a pretty good idea how to strap their rear-facing infant car seat into the back seat of their car, but they didn't like the idea of guessing. They sought help from the people at the local medical center, but those folks declined. "They were afraid that  if they told us how to do it, then there would be a problem. We would sue them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The medical staffers suggested that they seek help from the fire department, so on the way home from the hospital they stopped by the fire station. The woman wanted to help, but couldn't. "It is a liability issue," she said, referring the family to the local police. They called the police department, but the person they spoke to said again it is a liability thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important service that can help save the life of a child. However, the fear is that some departments and communities may be unwilling to offer this life-saving service because of fear of liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion to recommit I offer today would help remedy the situation. It would protect fire departments that wish to offer this service to the public. The language requires States or local governments covered under the provisions of this bill to protect their properly-trained firefighters from liability and lawsuits when they offer inspection and advice regarding car seat use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit gives States 2 years to provide protection for our firefighters. This service the firefighters are offering is too valuable to let it get bogged down by the threat of lawsuits. We should not allow trial lawyers to hijack the safety of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS. MC MORRIS RODGERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS. MC MORRIS RODGERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my mother grew up way out in the country, way, way out in the country, and when she was a young girl their house burned. The only things they saved were their lives and the clothes on their back. Today, 70 years later, whenever my mother hears a fire engine or sees a fire truck, she tells me that story about how her house burned, almost in a trance. It is a very traumatic experience when a family goes through something like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the reason that our committee worked in a bipartisan way to try to come forth with a very good bill that would help to save lives, save property and help our firefighters do a better job of hopefully shielding some other families from that trauma that my mother went through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is really unfortunate after all of that work that the gentlewoman would come forth with a mischievous amendment that has had no discussion. We don't know anything about is there a liability problem or not. We don't know whether or not this is going to affect States' own liability or whether this is going to preempt it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlewoman had an opportunity, if this is such an important issue, to both come before the committee and talk to us at the subcommittee level. But there was no discussion. She could have come to the subcommittee markup, where it passed unanimously. But there was no discussion. She could have come to the full committee markup, where again it passed out unanimously, but there was no effort. Or she could have gone to the Rules Committee and asked to have a rule and be allowed to submit the  amendment so we could have a discussion, even here at this late date. But there was no effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite frankly, I think this is a game of "gotcha." It is an insult to the Democrats and Republicans on the Science Committee, who worked hard to put this good bill together. It is an insult to the firefighters, who are trying to do their job every day and who need these funds and training. It is an insult to all those individuals and organizations that endorsed this bill, like the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer  Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the North American Fire Training Directors, the International Fire Services Training Association, and the Congressional Fire Service Institute. They endorsed this bill because it is a good bill, a bill that will help firefighters do their job. It is very unfortunate that we are trying to play these games at the last moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recommend that we vote down this amendment that we know nothing about and that we move forward with this good bill.</paragraph>
