    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007. Our late friend and colleague, Representative Charlie Norwood, introduced commonsense legislation to institute an efficient system, an efficient system, of identifying and detaining criminal aliens. Our good friend is gone, but his idea remains as viable today as it was the day that he first introduced it in the 108th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 400,000 alien absconders in our country, with 285,000 possessing criminal records. This bill targets those criminals by increasing Federal funds to local law enforcement agencies that need those funds, providing police that are on the beat with the resources they need and giving them the background, the information, to enforce immigration law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also cuts funding to sanctuary cities which have enacted laws prohibiting local police from detaining and arresting criminal aliens. Most notably, it requires the Federal Government to take these criminal aliens into custody within 48 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Join me in supporting the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007.</paragraph>
