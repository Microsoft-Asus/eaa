    <paragraph>I just returned from the Middle East. I went with a bipartisan group to Saudi Arabia, to the United Arab Emirates and to Kazakhstan and talked to the folks who have oil about what we can do internationally to bring the price down, bring the supply up, do whatever it takes to give middle class Americans some relief at the gas pump. It was interesting the response that I got.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, I can tell you without question the Middle East is happy with the current gas prices. We all know that they are enjoying the wealth which we are transferring over there. But the thing that they said to us, How dare you come to Saudi Arabia, how dare you come to the United Arab Emirates, how dare you come to Kazakhstan and ask us to reduce our prices when you won't even drill for oil yourself. You won't even build refineries. Yet you want us to do something. You can do it for yourself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about this, ladies and gentlemen. ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, is the size of South Carolina. The proposed drilling area is 2,000 acres. That is smaller than the average airport. Yet, for some reason, we are afraid to drill there. That is absurd. We need to drill now.</paragraph>
