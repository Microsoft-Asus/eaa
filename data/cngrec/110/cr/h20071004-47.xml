  <narrative>PROTECTING THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11303]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are certain principles that do not divide us by whether we've Republican or Democrat or an independent and that is, of course, the precious Bill of Rights, and the idea that we live in a country that is so unique and so different and so many people aspire to find just a simple taste of the democracy that we enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, after 9/11, all of us gathered together realizing that if we allowed the terrorists to terrorize us, change our way of life, they had won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we have seen a number of legislative initiatives and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I take no back step to securing America. But I understand that our values of democracy and the protection of the Bill of Rights should be the anchor of this society. And if we terrorize ourselves by taking away our rights, the terrorists have won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I stand here to emphasize certain basic principles as we look to revise the FISA law, and that is, of course, the law that clearly intercepts, undermines the fourth amendment; the right to be in your home and to be protected against unreasonable search and seizure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm delighted that you will be hearing, over the next couple of days, along with a markup coming up, the principles enunciated that emphasize the protection of the values of America. And so we simply believe, as I believe, in joining with a number of colleagues to emphasize that we believe that we live in a dangerous world, but we also should be guided by principles. Those principles should ensure that Americans do not have to be surveilled in their homes when they are communicating with fellow  Americans. We should not be suspect of our telecommunications companies to think that they are in cahoots, collaborating with our government to spy on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We realize that there is a difference when we talk about foreign-to-foreign communications, that there is a need for surveillance. And I'm here today to emphasize that we should stand and fight for the protection of the fourth amendment, to protect you in your homes and, at the same time, you can be protected against terrorists, because terrorism depends upon making sure that you have the information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when you have a court that is made available under the existing FISA law that was established in 1978 that understands the necessity and the urgency of the law enforcement officers that come to them, then you should support the idea of court intervention whenever someone determines  from the Federal Government to intervene and to listen to your communications between one American and another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand here today to emphasize that the court system, the FISA system, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, is an imperative to protect you as Americans when your government wants to spy on you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will we be safe from terrorists? Absolutely. Because part of the terrorism is to ensure that information is shared with law enforcement so that we can be in front of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to the markup. I'm looking forward to an opportunity to devise legislation that preserves the preciousness of the Bill of Rights and the fourth amendment. We cannot step back and be subjected to our own terror, and that is to be frightened so much that we take the Bill of Rights and extinguish it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I may not agree with the interpretation of the second amendment, but it does exist and it is part of the Bill of Rights. You may have a different interpretation of the first amendment, but it is part of the Bill of Rights. You may have a suspect interpretation of the fourth amendment, but the language is clear: you are to be protected against unreasonable search and seizure. It is unreasonable to not go into a court established to do that, to protect you, to have a court objectively look at what  the urgency is and to provide that intervention to protect your rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with a number of colleagues on language that I have joined and written to establish the parameters of protecting us from the violation of the fourth amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keep the FISA law as it is. Modernize it. Ensure that the FISA court that intervenes protects our rights and keeps our values, the values that so many have strived so hard to seek a place in the sun in this Nation because they truly believe that the democracy and the liberties that we have are worth protecting, worth protecting with their lives. And I believe here in the United States Congress, we must stand in that tradition.</paragraph>
