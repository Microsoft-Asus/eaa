    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> is a bipartisan effort by the Judiciary Committee, led by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly) as the chief sponsor and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) as the lead Democratic sponsor. Both have worked long and hard on this issue. I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Forbes for their leadership and support in moving this matter  forward, and also the former chairman of the committee, Mr. Coble, who is with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007 addresses the growing problem of staged animal fighting in this country. It increases the penalties under the current Federal law for transporting animals in interstate commerce for the purpose of fighting and for interstate and foreign commerce in knives and gaffs designed for use in cockfighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> makes violations of the law a felony punishable by up to 3 years in prison. Currently, these offenses are limited to misdemeanor treatment with the possibility of a fine and up to 1 year of imprisonment. Most States make all staged animal fighting illegal. Just one State currently allows cockfighting to occur legally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The transport of game birds for the purpose of animal fighting and the implements of cockfighting are already prohibited by Federal law, though the current law only allows, as I have indicated, the misdemeanor treatment. In 1976 Congress amended title 7, U.S. Code, section 2156, the Animal Welfare Act, to make it illegal to knowingly sell, buy, transport, deliver, or receive a dog or other animal in interstate or foreign commerce for the purposes of participation in an animal fighting venture  or knowingly sponsoring or exhibiting an animal in a fighting venture if any animal in the venture was moved in interstate or foreign commerce. Amendments to the Animal Welfare Act contained a loophole, however, that allowed shipments of birds across State lines for fighting purposes if the destination State allowed cockfighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Congress did amend section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act to close this  loophole in 2002, the penalty section and other provisions of the act have not been updated since their original enactment in 1976. This bill is designed to address those shortfalls to more effectively cover modern problems associated with animal fighting ventures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have already mentioned, the legislation increases current penalties to provide a meaningful deterrent. One of the primary reasons for enacting the increased penalties under title 18 is the reluctance of U.S. Attorneys to pursue animal fighting cases under the current misdemeanor provisions because they view the penalties as ineffective against an animal fighting industry, which has continued unabated nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> further makes it a felony to transport cockfighting implements in interstate or foreign commerce. These implements take the form of razor-sharp knives, known as slashers; or gaffs, instruments shaped in the form of curved ice picks that are attached to birds' legs for fighting. Proponents of these implements within the game fowl community apparently contend that they inflict cleaner wounds upon the birds which are then quicker and easier to heal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since penalties against animal fighting were codified in 1976, Federal authorities have pursued less than half a dozen animal fighting cases, despite the fact that the USDA has received numerous tips from informants and requests to assist with State and local prosecutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, despite the fact that all 50 States have banned dog fighting and all but one State has banned cockfighting, the animal fighting industry continues to thrive within the United States. Numerous nationally circulated animal fighting magazines advertise fighting animals, and paid lobbyists continue to advocate for animal fighters' interests. Thankfully, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> will seek to bring an end to these practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill affects matters within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and the Judiciary Committee. Both committees have worked closely together to ensure that all matters are dealt with appropriately. We appreciate their assistance in bringing this bill expeditiously to the floor, and I will insert into the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record at this point an exchange of letters between Chairman Peterson of the Agriculture Committee and Chairman Conyers  of Judiciary.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your recent letter regarding the Agriculture Committee's jurisdictional interest in <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the "Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007," which the Committee on the Judiciary reported by voice vote. As ordered reported, the bill establishes criminal penalties for violations of Federal prohibitions on animal fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to discharge the bill from further consideration by your Committee, in order to expedite its floor consideration. I understand and agree that this is without prejudice to your Committee's jurisdictional interests in this or similar legislation in the future. In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar legislation is convened, I would support your request for an appropriate number of conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will include a copy of your letter and this response as part of the Congressional Record during consideration of the legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your cooperation as we work towards enactment of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your recent letter regarding Judiciary Committee action on <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, a bill to establish criminal penalties for violations of Federal prohibitions on animal fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of expediting the consideration of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, I agree to the discharge of the bill from further consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with the understanding that the Committee on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over this or similar matters. In the event a conference with the Senate is requested on this bill, the Committee on Agriculture reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collin C. Peterson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007, creates Federal felony penalties for animal fighting. The distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly) is the lead sponsor of this bill with over 300 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act increases criminal penalties for illegal dog fighting and cockfighting. The act, furthermore, imposes penalties for the interstate promotion of animal fighting and the interstate transportation of animals for use in an animal fighting venture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All 50 States, Mr. Speaker, prohibit dog fighting, and 48 States prohibit cockfighting. Louisiana and New Mexico, the two States that do, in fact, allow cockfighting, may take up legislation to ban the practice as early as this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Humane Society, animal fighting, particularly cockfighting, has become an interstate venture with small syndicates of cockfighters moving across the country staging these different fights. Animal fighting is also linked oftentimes with other criminal conduct such as drug trafficking, illegal firearms sales, and gang activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By raising this offense from a misdemeanor to a felony, we are more likely to deter illegal animal fighting and increase the likelihood that Federal prosecutors will pursue these cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to subcommittee Chairman Bobby Scott we owe a debt of gratitude, as well as to subcommittee Ranking Member Coble and, of course, the author of this bill, Elton Gallegly, who through the years has persevered to make us finally come to this day. I guess we should also thank about 303 Members of the House of Representatives that have stuck with us and supported this legislation all this time. My congratulations to all of you. I never thought that  a measure that was not considered as grave and large as some of the issues that come before the House Judiciary Committee would meet with so much encouragement and support to get us to this day. I congratulate the House of Representatives and the leadership on both sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join, of course, in this measure and would like to make this point: this legislation includes a special provision clarifying the fact that it only supersedes State law in the case of a direct or irreconcilable conflict. The Humane Society is with us. The American Veterinary Medical Association is with us. The National Association of Sheriffs is with us, and hundreds and hundreds of local law enforcement agencies in every State of the Union have all come out in support of this basic, commonsense,  long overdue legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank those who have worked so tirelessly across the years to bring us to this day where this bill has now come before the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to join the growing list of supporters, including the 30 or so Members of the Judiciary Committee, that have decided to lend their support to this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, the sponsors of abusive animal fighting events (including cockfight and dog fight promoters) have been permitted to freely engage in such activities without any real fear of prosecution. Fortunately, the bill before us seeks to change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the legislation provides up to the three years in jail for people who transport animals in interstate commerce with the purpose of participating in an animal fighting venture. Current law only treats such offenses as a mere misdemeanor. However, research has shown us that simple misdemeanor criminal penalties  don't provide enough of a meaningful deterrent, especially when thousands of dollars are wagered on a single dog or cock fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the legislation makes it unlawful to sell or ship instruments in interstate commerce that are designed to be attached to the leg of a bird for use in an animal fighting venture. Razor sharp knives, commonly known as "slashers", are oftentimes attached to the legs of a bird to make cockfights even more violent. This provision would prohibit such activity, and subject any violators to a term of imprisonment of up to three years in jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the legislation includes a special provision clarifying that this measure only supersedes state law in the case of a direct or irreconcilable conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Humane Society, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Sheriffs Association, and nearly 400 local law enforcement agencies covering all 50 states have all come out in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to lend their support to this bipartisan, commonsense measure as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly), member of the House Judiciary Committee and original sponsor of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. GALLEGLY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400144" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, along with my good friend EARL BLUMENAUER and ROSCOE BARTLETT, we have been trying to federally criminalize this brutal, inhumane practice of animal fighting for the past several Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress enacted legislation to tighten Federal animal fighting laws, we left in place weak penalties that have proven ineffective and allowed the barbaric practice to thrive, in spite of bans in virtually every State. Misdemeanor penalties simply don't provide a meaningful deterrent. Animal fighters consider misdemeanor penalties as a "slap on the wrist" or merely the "cost of doing business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State and local law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about animal fighting not only because of the animal cruelty involved but because of the other crimes that often go hand in hand with animal fighting, including illegal gambling, drug trafficking, and acts of human violence. In the last 6 months, virtually every reported arrest in an animal fight has also led to additional arrests for at least one of these criminal activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cockfighting has also spread diseases that jeopardize poultry and even public health. California experienced this firsthand when cockfighters spread exotic Newcastle disease in 2002 and 2003. That outbreak cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $200 million to eradicate, and the cost to the U.S. poultry industry was in the millions. Cockfighting has been identified as the major contributor to the spread of avian flu throughout Thailand and other parts of Asia, where the strain originated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my sincere thanks to you, EARL BLUMENAUER, and to ROSCOE BARTLETT for their work on this legislation. I also commend and thank my good friend and neighbor Mr. JOHN CONYERS, the chairman of the committee; LAMAR SMITH, the ranking member; BOBBY SCOTT, the chairman of the subcommittee; and RANDY FORBES, the ranking member, for recognizing the importance of this issue and moving <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> through the Judiciary Committee so quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Also I want to recognize COLLIN PETERSON on the Ag Committee for his assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, more important than all, is recognizing the 303-plus Members that have co-sponsored this legislation. It is hard to believe that we have that many people agreeing on something like this when it is not often that we have that many people in the House agreeing on what day of the week it is. So I want to thank all of them for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with all of us in passing this legislation when we bring it to a vote here in a couple of minutes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Scott's courtesy in permitting me to speak and the leadership in taking what is seemingly a simple and innocuous bill and bringing it to the floor of the House. I appreciate working with my friend, ELTON GALLEGLY. This has been a long haul, lots of ups and downs, but today we reach an important milestone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is my fifth year of working on this issue. We were exposed to it during the last farm bill. We found that this got caught up in back-room machinations that really just defy description.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have already heard about the despicable cruelty. You have heard about the association with illegal activity, gambling, violence, drugs and firearms trade. Louisiana is now poised to become the last State to make it illegal, making it illegal in every State in the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why then is this even an issue? Well, it is an underground and pervasive activity. It is in fact active across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just heard from one of our floor staff as we walked in today that he saw accounts from small town newspapers in Alabama the last 2 weeks in articles there. In Portland, Oregon, in recent months we have had officers break into a meth and coke den where there were 43 live chickens and all the equipment, as well as illegal weapons and large amounts of cash. In another high-profile case in my community, a professional basketball player was involved with illegal fighting of his pit bull.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something that has been an area, frankly, where Congress has shamefully been complicit. We have ignored the fact that inadequate penalties, as has been said by the chairman of the committee, by my friend from California, which have just been the "cost of doing business," We have looked the other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important vote today. I am confident with over 300 co-sponsors it will pass, and it will pass overwhelmingly. But the battle is not done. Never underestimate the power of the apologists, the allies and the enablers of this vicious and cruel, I won't even call it a "sport," it is a vicious practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that we will move forward with not just voting today, but make sure that it passes the other body, and it is not subjected, as it has been time and time again over the last 5 years, to some other devious action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do not sell short the people who are apologists for this sport. Join with us not just with your vote but to make sure that we get this legislation enacted and then enforced around the country.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&amp;#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007, because it is time for the Federal Government to up the ante in its efforts to curb this cruel and gruesome abuse of animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current misdemeanor penalties in Federal law have not been effective. They are considered a cost of doing business by the animal fighting industry, which continues to operate across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses the growing problem of animal fighting by amending Federal law to prohibit moving animals through interstate commerce for the purpose of fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do we want to make a Federal case out of this? Yes, we do. Those who profit from animal fighting often drug dogs and roosters to make them hyper-aggressive and to keep fighting even after suffering severe injuries. The animals are in a closed pit from which they cannot escape. Often, they die during the fight. This is a gruesome and inhumane practice. The American people agree. Dog fighting is illegal in 50 States and cockfighting is illegal in most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law is simply not strong enough. Animal fighting often leads to additional criminal behavior. It is associated with illegal gambling, narcotics trafficking, public corruption, gang activity, and violent behavior toward people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Sheriffs' Association supports the legislation, and more than 400 individual sheriffs and police departments in every State in the country have endorsed it. They recognize that animal fighting often involves movement of animals across interstate  and foreign borders, and they can't do the job on their own. They need the Federal Government to do its part to curb this dangerous activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort to curb this appalling treatment of animals. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is my first year in the Congress. In my 24 years in the State senate, I was the leading spokesperson for animal welfare legislation, and I took great pride in that. So I am particularly appreciative of standing up on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I incorporate by reference all the things that have been said about the harmful effects of this practice, and they are well known. I think that the spread of avian flu and all the other pertinent conduct is to be prohibited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the main thing is, dogs are our best friends. Harry Truman said, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. So far, I haven't been here 90 days, I have made lots of friends. I haven't needed a dog yet, but I have thought about the day. I saw a Congressman come in the other day, Congressman Whitfield from Kentucky, he had his dog with him. He has been here more years than me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dogs are our friends. We all have dogs that we feel that are part of our families. We shouldn't treat any of God's creatures the way that people treat dogs and cocks; and I guess if I was from Kentucky, Congressman Yarmuth, I could speak more fondly about chickens, because the Colonel and KFC have done a lot for his district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But my particular interest is dogs, and we should treat them well. They are our friends. You can go back in TV lore, Lassie and Asta, and you think about Snoopy. To teach them to fight, to require them to fight, to watch them die is just not what God intended and not what we should encourage and condone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children shouldn't be exposed to this, and sometimes they are. This type of conduct leads to other types of harmful conduct and violence against women, violence against seniors. People who enjoy this type of violence and watching it are more often than not going to be the most likely people to pick on others who are unable to take care of themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to be a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>. I look forward to its passage and the day that we don't have people who get some type of great enjoyment out of watching dogs, cocks or any other of God's creatures fight to the death and find pleasure and enjoyment in it and teach their children by that association that violence is something good, when it isn't.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank both my friend from North Carolina and my friend from Virginia, as well as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this forward, as well as those who have spoken on behalf of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not just a nuisance industry. This is a malicious industry that represents a very, very serious public health threat. We are very much concerned that the interstate or international transport, especially of birds used for cockfighting, could spread an influenza outbreak. The World Health Organization has reported at least nine confirmed human cases of avian flu in Thailand and Vietnam that they expect is related directly to cockfighting activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Veterinary Medical Association, the poultry industry, all the animal protection associations, of course, but the National Sheriffs' Association as well has urged us to pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, there are 50 different State bills against dog fighting, 49 against cockfighting, but many of them are different. And the fact is there is a great deal of interstate commerce that takes place, so you need a Federal law banning this, because it is so closely associated, and this is what the National Sheriffs' Association tells us, so closely associated to illegal gambling, trafficking of narcotics, public corruption, dangerous gang activity. There are so many reasons why we should ban this  practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been said, it is cruel, and it is inhumane. They drug these animals so that they are hyper-aggressive, so that they will continue fighting until they kill or are killed. That is not right. It is not moral. But even beyond the cruel and inhumane aspect of this practice, it represents a very dangerous public health threat, as well as a source of a great deal of other illegal criminal activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House would be well-served to listen to the more than 300 Members who have cosponsored this legislation and pass it today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank the author of the bill and certainly the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, the chairman of the full committee and ranking members as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to enthusiastically support <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> and announce that it is impacting so many different communities that it is imperative that there be a Federal prohibition on transporting animals interstate. There is a question of disease, there is a question of violence, and certainly with the increasing numbers of dangerous animals that attack human beings, fighting animals certainly pose a severe threat to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill. I am delighted to be a co-sponsor. The good news is that we are getting it through the House today. This bill has been around since the last session. I congratulate all of the authors. It is time now to spell relief by passing this bill and protecting the lives of our children and saving the lives of those who would be endangered by cockfighting and other dangerous activities with animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the "Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007." I was a co-sponsor of this legislation when it was considered in the 109th Congress and a strong supporter and co-sponsor when the bill was re-introduced in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> establishes felony-level jail time (up to 3 years) for violators of the Federal animal fighting law. The bill amends Title 18 of the U.S. Code to strengthen the maximum jail time from the 1-year misdemeanor level in current law. The bill also prohibits interstate and foreign commerce in cockfighting weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. DOGFIGHTING AND COCKFIGHTING ARE INHUMANE AND BARBARIC ACTIVITIES</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a typical fight, animals are drugged to heighten their aggression and forced to keep fighting even after injuries such as pierced lungs and gouged eyes--all for the amusement and illegal wagering of handlers and spectators. Dogfighting and cockfighting are also associated with other criminal conduct, such as drug traffic, illegal firearms use, and violence toward people. Children are often present at these spectacles. Some dogfighters steal pets to use as bait for training their dogs; some  allow trained fighting dogs to roam neighborhoods and endanger the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. FELONY PENALTIES ARE NEEDED</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Misdemeanor penalties don't provide a meaningful deterrent; they're considered a "slap on the wrist" or a "cost of doing business." And prosecutors are reluctant to pursue animal fighting cases carrying only a misdemeanor penalty. Since the Federal animal fighting law was first enacted in 1976, authorities have pursued only a handful of cases, despite receiving innumerable informant tips about illegal interstate activity and requests to assist with state and local busts and prosecutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. THE ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT ACT BRINGS FEDERAL LAW IN LINE WITH STATE LAWS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Federal animal fighting law was enacted in 1976, only one state had felony penalties for animal fighting. Today, dogfighting is a felony in 48 states, and cockfighting is a felony in 33 states. State laws commonly authorize jail time of 3 to 5 years or more for animal fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. OTHER RECENT FEDERAL ANIMAL PROTECTION LAWS THAT AMENDED TITLE 18 OF THE U.S. CODE HAVE FELONY PENALTIES</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, Congress authorized imprisonment of up to 5 years for interstate commerce in videos depicting animal cruelty, including animal fighting (P.L. 106-152), and mandatory  jail time of up to 10 years for willfully harming or killing a federal police dog or horse (P.L. 106-254).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. THERE IS NO REASON TO ALLOW INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE IN SHARP IMPLEMENTS DESIGNED EXCLUSIVELY FOR COCKFIGHTS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Razor-sharp knives known as "slashers" and ice pick-like gaffs are attached to the legs of birds to make cockfights more violent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These weapons, used only in cockfights, are sold through cockfighting magazines and through the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. THE ANIMAL FIGHTING INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO THRIVE ACROSS THE U.S</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All 50 states ban dogfighting, 48 states ban cockfighting, and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of animal fighting raids by state and local authorities. Yet numerous nationally circulated animal fighting magazines still promote these cruel practices and advertise fighting animals and the accoutrements of animal fighting. There are also several active websites for animal fighting enthusiasts, and paid lobbyists advocating animal fighters' interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>7. COCKFIGHTERS HAVE SPREAD DISEASES AND POSE A CONTINUING THREAT TO FARMERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As former Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman wrote in a May 2004 letter indicating the Bush Administration's endorsement of the animal fighting felony legislation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"[cockfighting has] been implicated in the introduction and spread of exotic Newcastle disease in California in 2002-2003, which cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $200 million to eradicate, and cost the U.S. poultry industry many millions more in lost export markets....... We believe that tougher penalties and prosecution will help to deter illegal movement of birds as well as the inhumane practice of cockfighting itself."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to government officials, interstate and international transport of fighting birds posed the greatest risk of transmission, since cockfighters move their birds often and participants from as many as a dozen states gather at illegal fighting derbies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cockfighting also has been implicated in the deaths of at least 9 people in Asia who were reportedly exposed through cockfighting activity to bird flu. The National Chicken Council, which represents 95% of U.S. poultry producers/processors, has called on Congress to enact the animal fighting felony legislation, noting "we are concerned that the nationwide traffic in game birds creates a continuing hazard for the dissemination of animal diseases." We can't afford not to act. The economic consequences  of an avian influenza outbreak are staggering--with U.S. losses estimated at between $185 and $618 billion (Congressional Budget Office) and worldwide losses projected from $1.5 to $2 trillion (The World Bank).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>8. <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> ENJOYS OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> currently has more than 300 sponsors. More than 400 local and state law enforcement agencies covering every state in the country have endorsed this legislation, along with animal welfare, poultry industry, and other organizations. Enacting this animal fighting legislation is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is bipartisan legislation. We have listened to all of the people who have worked long and hard on this legislation. I hope it will be the pleasure of the House to pass the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support the Animal Fighting Prohibition Act, which would raise the penalty for violators of the federal animal welfare law, from a class 1 misdemeanor to a felony. In an industry where thousands of dollars change hands with each fight, misdemeanor fines and charges are simply considered "the costs of doing business". This bill would close this loophole and keep criminals from traveling to states with weaker penalties to conduct their business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Animal fights are not only despicable for their cruelty to animals, but they are commonly associated with illegal gambling, drug traffic, firearms trades, and numerous other illicit activities. Recently in Oregon, officers found meth, cocaine, $10,000 in cash, along with 43 live chickens, cockfighting equipment including metal spurs and gaffs in a Portland man's home. Drugs are often the impetus for the discovery of gamecocks and illegal weapons. In another high profile Oregon case, a former  Portland Trailblazer pled guilty to animal abuse for fighting his pit bull. Officials found her bloody, scarred, and covered in tar which is used by fighters as a cheap antiseptic to fresh wounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But animal fighting doesn't just pose a threat to the people and animals who engage in them, it has enormous costs to the United States health and economy. Cockfighting has been implicated in the introduction and spread of exotic Newcastle disease in California in 2002-2003, which cost the U.S. taxpayers nearly $200 million to eradicate. The disease spread further to large scale egg farms in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas; costing the U.S. poultry industry many millions of dollars in  lost export markets. Cockfighting has also been implicated in the deaths of at least 9 people in Asia who contracted avian flu after exposure to fighting birds. If avian flu were to reach the shores of America, the economic and human consequences would be staggering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has widespread support across the country, including 303 cosponsors in the House and 35 cosponsors in the Senate. <bill type="h" number="137">HR 137</bill> is endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States, the National Chicken Council which represents 95 percent of the Nation's poultry producers, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Sheriff's Association, and more than 400 local law enforcement agencies. Currently there is only one bastion left for cock fighters; the State of Louisiana. Although  gamers have attempted to use tribal lands as exemptions from state and federal laws, a federal jury recently convicted four men for their participation in a cockfight, and 70 others entered guilty pleas. It is my understanding that the increase in penalties contained within this bill would be equally applicable to animal fights held on tribal lands or Indian Reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is far past time that Congress give our law enforcement agencies the tools they need to end this barbaric and consequential practice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, of which I am also a cosponsor. The way a society treats its animals speaks to the core values and priorities of its citizens. I am committed to animal welfare because I believe humankind has an obligation to all animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, it is a misdemeanor to sell, buy, or transport an animal to be used in a fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would make the crime a felony and increase the imprisonment penalty from 1 year to 3 years. The legislation also makes it unlawful to ship in interstate commerce a knife, gaff, or other sharp instrument used in cockfighting, and makes it a felony to use the postal service to promote an animal fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dog fighting is banned in 50 states and cockfighting is banned in all but two, so I believe the Federal government is simply codifying a value that our States governments have already individually expressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Animal fighting is a cruel pastime where, in a typical fight, animals are drugged to heighten their aggression and forced to keep fighting, even after injuries, for the amusement and illegal wagering of handlers and spectators. We must put an end to this form of entertainment, which results in the brutal treatment of animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus, I will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to help protect animals at the Federal level.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with my colleagues Mr. GALLEGLY and Mr. BLUMENAUER, I have introduced <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> to establish felony-level jail time of up to 3 years for those who violate the law against animal fighting. <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> would amend current law to toughen the maximum jail time from a one-year misdemeanor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The penalties in the existing federal animal fighting statute are too weak. The upgraded penalty better aligns federal law with state law. Almost all states have established felony-level penalties for illegal animal fighting activities. State laws commonly authorize jail time of 3 to 5 years or more for animal fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Bernard Shaw once stated, "The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them, that's the essence of inhumanity." We should not be indifferent to the reprehensible underground organized crime of animal fighting, which is not only cruel but poses threats to public health and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Humane Society of the U.S. estimates that there are at least 40,000 dogfighters in America. Cockfighting has been tied to the spread of bird flu. Animal fighting spawns a number of other criminal activities, such as illegal gambling and using and selling drugs. Even more disturbing is the conclusion by many experts that acts of cruelty against animals are precursors to violence against humans. The felony-level penalties against animal fighting in <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> are necessary, and I urge my colleagues  to support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues know, I have had a lifelong love and compassion for animals of all kinds. That is why I am simply shocked that it is not already illegal to take animals across state lines for the purpose of fighting. This is an inhumane and cruel practice that must not be allowed to continue. Another reason why this practice must be outlawed is because animal fighting spreads disease and poses an enormous public health risk. At a time when  avian  flu is at the forefront of this county's health-related worries, it should be of the utmost concern to people that animal fighting is occurring all across the country. It makes one wonder, what kind of person could enjoy a "sport" like this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the forty-eight states where animal fighting is already outlawed, illegal gambling goes hand-in-hand with this gruesome activity. <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007, makes it a felony to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal or to use interstate commerce for the purposes of fighting. This bill would impose a prison sentence of up to 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have supported this legislation since 2003. I am pleased that this legislation has overwhelming bipartisan support, with 303 cosponsors. Obviously we need stronger laws on this because this practice still continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007. It is hard to believe that an act as horrendous and brutal as animal fighting still takes place today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill> would make engaging in animal fighting a felony. This legislation will ensure that those who choose to fight animals illegally will be met with the appropriate penalty when they disregard the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the fact that the vast majority of states have banned this atrocious and deplorable act, animal fighting continues to plague our communities. Animals such as dogs and chickens are fought to the death in the name of sport. This is unhealthy, violent behavior on the part of humans and is inhumane and merciless to the animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend both local and state officials for stepping up raids on animal fighting rings. Now it is time for this body of Congress to do our part by making these offenses a felony under Federal law. I urge my colleagues to join me and vote in favor of the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>.</paragraph>
