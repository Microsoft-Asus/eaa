    <paragraph>Mr. President, as modern communication makes our world increasingly smaller, linking global societies at unprecedented business, government and social levels, it is critical that America and other democracies worldwide engage in a process of ongoing co-education about the efforts and work of democratic governments. This educational exchange is best facilitated by hands-on learning and personal experience. A terrific example of this effort is the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme,  in which outstanding college students from seven of Australia's top universities compete for the opportunity to serve as interns for Members of the U.S. Congress. In its eighth year, the program has facilitated internships for 68 Australian students thus far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fortunate to be able to participate this year. Charis Tierney from Brisbane, Queensland, has been a wonderful addition to my office this winter. She says of this opportunity:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The UCWIP has been a once in a lifetime to not only observe but participate in the work of the U.S. Congress. Working within Senator Crapo's office has given me the kind of unique appreciation for the United States Senate's work that can only be gained from behind the scenes. My daily interaction with the fantastic staff of the Senator's office has only enhanced the experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my congratulations to Director Eric Federing and his wife Daphne for their support and dedication of this important educational program. The additional activities such as visits to historic sites, meetings with other government agencies and outside organizations and special events helps enhance the experience for these promising young women and men. The Federings' commitment to comprehensive bilateral civic education has made it possible for students like Charis to take their experiences  here in the legislative branch of the U.S. Government back to Australia and apply lessons learned as they pursue their own course of study across a wide range of academic pursuits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This valuable program bridges the 9,000 miles that separate the United States and Australia with the friendship of shared experiences and realization and application of common goals and interests.</paragraph>
