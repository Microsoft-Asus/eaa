  <speaking speaker="412256" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States is at a crucial point in terms of domestic energy production. With estimates that China and India combined will consume more energy than the United States by 2015, we must take a serious look at our domestic energy production and continue to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's increasing offshore energy production to reduce its own dependence on foreign oil, growing their production an average of 15.3 percent per year with plans to make offshore production China's largest source of oil by doubling production by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current congressional leadership opposes domestic offshore energy exploration and production, making America the only developed nation in the world to restrict access to offshore energy supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has invested $24 billion in coal liquefaction technology, while current congressional leadership continues to exclude coal from their energy policy, even though it is the most abundant and efficient fuel source found in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on about our energy crisis, but it's time for this Congress to get serious about our domestic energy production.</paragraph>
