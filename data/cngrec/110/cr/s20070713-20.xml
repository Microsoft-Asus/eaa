  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to mark the centennial of Elida, NM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July 1907, the town of Elida was officially incorporated, and for the last 100 years this small New Mexico town has remained a close-knit ranching community. Although much has changed in Elida during the last 100 years, many things have not. Elida is still the kind of town where neighbors take the time to help one another and come together for a Fourth of July barbeque every year. I believe that kind of community is something special and those individuals who call Elida home should be proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the residents of Elida and the surrounding area gather this weekend to celebrate the history of their town, I would like to wish them well and I hope Elida has another wonderful 100 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
