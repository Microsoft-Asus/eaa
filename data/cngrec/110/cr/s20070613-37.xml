    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize Wessington Springs, SD. The town of Wessington Springs will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Jerauld County, Wessington Springs was founded in 1882. It was named after a man named Wessington and also after the natural springs that flow through the town's hills. While Wessington's identity is not certain, there are a number of local legends about a trapper by that name who spent time in the area. Wessington Springs has been a successful and thriving community for the past 125 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions  for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Wessington Springs on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
