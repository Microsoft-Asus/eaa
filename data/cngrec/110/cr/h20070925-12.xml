    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush threatened to veto a bipartisan agreement that will provide health insurance to 10 million of America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before acting on this threat, the President should talk to our Nation's Governors, 43 of whom support a robust reauthorization of children's health insurance, known as SCHIP, set to expire this Sunday night. Governors such as Republican John Huntsman of Utah, Republican Tim Pawlenty of Wisconsin, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and Republican Jodi Rell of my State of Connecticut have all endorsed protecting this program, which the bipartisan agreement will accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake about it; the President's plan will disqualify millions of American children from SCHIP coverage in the future. We already know, in Connecticut, 5,000 children will be kicked off the existing SCHIP program if his plan goes through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Republican and Democratic Governors together recognize the importance of a strong SCHIP program. It is time for him to listen to these Governors and back off his veto threat.</paragraph>
