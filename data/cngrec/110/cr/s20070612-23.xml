    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, June 12, is the annual observance of the International Labor Organization's World Day Against Child Labor. This is the day we set aside each year to speak out against the fact that millions of children around the globe continue to be trapped in forced and abusive labor, often in extremely hazardous conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, I have been active in efforts to stop exploitative child labor as well as trafficking in child and female slaves around the world. In my travels, I have seen this scourge firsthand. I have come to the floor of the Senate many times to speak about this issue. I have spoken about how shocked I was to see the deplorable conditions under which these kids are forced to work. Many are physically, emotionally, and sexually abused. All of them, every child engaged in abusive child labor,  is deprived of a childhood solely for someone else's gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why should we as a nation tolerate children being used in such a manner? We should not. It is a moral outrage and an affront to human dignity. When a child is exploited for the economic gains of others, not only does the child lose, but the family loses, and I think the whole world loses. It is bad economics, and it is bad development strategy. A nation cannot achieve prosperity on the backs of its children, and there must be no place in the global economy for child labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the World Day Against Child Labor specifically shines a spotlight on child laborers in agriculture. This has been a special concern for me going back many years. I have been especially concerned about forced child labor in the cocoa industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, the Knight-Ridder syndicate ran a series of articles on forced child labor on cocoa farms in West Africa. According to one of those articles, child laborers in Ivory Coast "are whipped, beaten, and broken like horses to harvest the almond-sized beans that are made into chocolate treats for more fortunate children in Europe and the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I read these articles, I resolved to do everything I could to end this tragic exploitation of children. Together with Congressman Eliot Engel of New York, we engaged the major chocolate companies in lengthy, intense negotiations. The result was what is now called the Harkin-Engel protocol, an agreement that aims to ensure that cocoa beans are grown and processed in a manner that complies with the International Labor Organization Convention 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate  action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Harkin-Engel protocol, signed in September 2001, applies everywhere that cocoa is grown and processed. It laid out a series of date-specific actions, including the development of credible, mutually acceptable, voluntary industry-wide standards of public certification by July 1, 2005 in order to give a public accounting of labor practices in cocoa farming. Although I was disappointed that the July 2005 deadline was not fully met by the industry, we have continued to work together and the rollout  of the certification system--including monitoring, data analysis reporting, and activities to reduce the worst forms of child labor--will proceed as aggressively as possible in Ivory Coast and Ghana with the goal of covering 50 percent of the two countries' cocoa producing areas by July of 2008. This is, indeed, a milestone on the path toward the ultimate goal of 100 percent coverage in cocoa-producing countries around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The clock is ticking. The corporations and national governments that were party to the Harkin-Engel protocol are moving forward. For example, the Government of Ghana has conducted a pilot project and the results were released. However, the results still need to be independently verified, and I am hopeful that the industry will work with the Ghanaian government to have these preliminary reports independently verified in accordance with the protocol. Additionally, the Ivorian government has only  recently begun to conduct a pilot certification process. It is a good start, but that pilot needs to be scaled up in order to give more realistic results for the main harvest season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Harkin-Engel protocol marks an important first--an entire industry, including companies from the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom taking responsibility for addressing the worst forms of child labor and forced labor in its supply chain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the protocol stands as a framework for progress in West Africa, bringing together industry, West African governments, organized labor, nongovernmental organizations, farmers groups, and experts in a concerted effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced labor from the growing and processing of cocoa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further assist in the effort to eradicate child labor, in my capacity as chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, this past April I convened a hearing to facilitate collaborative efforts by advocacy groups in the child labor field. In light of the International Labor Organization's report last year, the discussion focused on how best to continue the cooperative international effort to eradicate child labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ILO global report, "The End of Child Labor: Within Reach," states that for the first time child labor, especially in its worst forms, is in decline across the globe. Between the years 2000 and 2004, the number of child laborers worldwide fell by 11 percent, from 246 million to 218 million. Even better, the number of children and youth aged 5-17 trapped in hazardous work decreased by 26 percent, declining from 171 million in 2000 to 126 million in 2004. Among younger child laborers, the  drop was even sharper at 33 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is remarkable progress in just 4 years' time. And looking to the future, the report cautiously predicts that, if the current pace of decline is maintained, and if global efforts to stop child labor continue, we have a real shot at eliminating child labor in its worst forms within 10 years' time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 218 million child laborers--many of whom are trapped in the worst forms of child labor, such as prostitution, armed conflicts, and slavery--are still suffering. While the U.S. Government and international organizations such as the World Bank and UNICEF have programs designed to reduce abusive and exploitative child labor, it will require all of these entities and others working together if we are to reach the goal of ending the worst forms of child labor by the year 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, in the broader fight against child labor, the ILO report verifies that we are on the right track to eliminate abusive and exploitative child labor. The great work of the ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor, IPEC, affirms the confidence I placed in this program early on. I secured the first Federal appropriation for the IPEC program back in 1996, and over the last decade, I have secured a total of more than $323 million for the program. Clearly, that money has  made a real difference in the lives of children. It has given millions of children an opportunity to get an education and to break the cycle of poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although there has been a tremendous amount of progress in ending child labor, now is not the time to become complacent. Economic development alone is not enough. We must also focus on human rights and educational opportunities for those in poverty. Social change must go hand in hand with economic development, which requires workers' and employers' organizations. Our keys to success will be mainstreaming child labor efforts with other human rights and development goals, as well as getting national  governments, NGOs, and international organizations working cooperatively to end child poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not think about these children only on June 12 each year. We should think about this last vestige of slavery 365 days a year. I have remained steadfast in my commitment to eliminating abusive and exploitative child labor. It was in 1992 that I first introduced a bill to ban all products made by abusive and exploitative child labor from entering the United States. And I am committed to working with the representatives of the cocoa industry and the national governments to implement the  Harkin-Engel Protocol by July 1, 2008 deadline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, we can make significant progress to eliminate this scourge if we all do our part and redouble our efforts. This means that governments must not merely pass laws but enforce them, while also striving to provide quality free education. Businesses must take responsibility, as well, by not hiring children, and by paying adults livable wages so they can provide for their families. Multilateral institutions must also play a robust role. Together, we can eliminate the worst forms of child  labor by 2016.</paragraph>
