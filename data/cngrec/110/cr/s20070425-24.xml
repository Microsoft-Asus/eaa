    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I offer a few remarks regarding National Small Business Week, which President Bush designated for April 22-28, 2007. As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, one of my top priorities is to champion our Nation's small businesses and to promote their needs and concerns. Our top job creators deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, I have already discussed how Congress must solve the small business health insurance crisis and bolster the state of our Nation's small manufacturers. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes on the critical role small businesses play in the American economy. In the back of our minds, we in Congress all know how vital small businesses are to economic growth. But when we come to the floor to speak about small businesses issues, we are generally trying to fix a specific problem. We  generally gloss over the overall impact small businesses have on driving our Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, an independent voice for small businesses within the Federal Government, has published a wide variety of statistics regarding small firms. This data, which shows that small businesses are responsible for 50 percent of nonfarm economic output, or gross domestic product, clearly reflects how vital small businesses are to job creation and the Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One little known fact is that small businesses represent just about every private-sector employer in the United States. According to the Office of Advocacy, which defines a small business as an independent employer with fewer than 500 employees, small firms represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms. In 2005, approximately 25.8 million small businesses, 671,800 of which are estimated to have opened in that year alone, were operational and providing consumers and businesses with goods and services.  Of these firms, 5.8 million had employees, and 18.6 million were sole proprietorships. In contrast, there were only approximately 17,000 larger business in operation across the country in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only do small businesses account for just about every employer in the United States, but these firms are also job providers. Small businesses employ fully half of all private-sector workers. They also pay more than 45 percent of U.S. private payroll. Of the 113.4 million nonfarm private-sector workers in 2003, 57.4 million were employed by small firms with fewer than 500 employees. Notably, small businesses with fewer than 100 employees accounted for 41 million of that number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to employing American workers, small businesses are also at the forefront of creating new jobs. Over the last decade, small businesses have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually. What is particularly interesting is that in 2003, the most recent year for which complete data is available, small businesses created 1,990,326 net new jobs. In contrast, large firms with 500 or more employees shed 994,667 jobs. Thus, if it were not for small businesses, the economy would have  lost jobs in 2003 instead of creating just about 1 million new employment opportunities for America's workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital to point out that the jobs small businesses are creating reflect the needs of a high-tech, innovative, and global marketplace. Small businesses have led the technological revolution and currently employ 41 percent of high-tech workers, including scientists, engineers, and information technology professionals. Moreover, small businesses are constantly creating new products, producing 13 to 14 times more patents per employee than large firms. In addition, these patents are twice as  likely as large-firm patents to be among the one percent most-often cited. Finally, America's small business are competing on a global scale, comprising 97 percent of all identified exporters and producing 28.6 of total exports in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is small businesses are the driving force behind our Nation's economic growth creating nearly three-quarters of all net new jobs and employing nearly 51 percent of the private sector workforce. These are the reasons it is so essential that we in Congress continue to support small businesses' ability to grow and expand so that our economy can accelerate forward and create more jobs. I hope we keep this in  mind when we come to the floor to fight  for fewer regulations, a lower tax burden, and more affordable and accessible health insurance for small businesses and their employees.</paragraph>
