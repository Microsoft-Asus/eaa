  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have been at war in Iraq for 5 years, longer than we fought World War II. And notwithstanding all of the rosy predictions by this President and his staff, we are now stuck refereeing a civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our soldiers are to be praised; they have done an outstanding job. But our political leaders in Washington, including those in this Congress, should be strongly criticized for acquiescing and going along time and time again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told that we need to stay the course for the sake of our standing in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, this war has diminished our standing in the world. Enough is enough. It is time to bring this war in Iraq to an end.</paragraph>
