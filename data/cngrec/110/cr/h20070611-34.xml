    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to raise awareness of an issue in our Texas offices and I think around the country: The significant application backlog in the Houston passport office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Friday morning, a number of Members of Congress from Texas and I went to that office. I call on the adminstration and the State Department to take the necessary steps to alleviate the backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know in the Houston office, Jacqueline Harley-Bell, the regional director of the Houston Passport Agency, and the staff have been working long days and weekends, and I commend them for their efforts to serve the public because they are understaffed and overwhelmed by the number of applications they are getting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Houston office has already issued nearly 11 million passports in the first 5 1/2  months of 2007. That is 3 million more than the 7.9 million that were issued in all of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration needs to provide the resources necessary now for additional workers or funding, to clear the backlog due to the new requirement that folks traveling in North America by plane need to have a passport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Thursday the administration changed the requirement, or delayed it, that individuals flying into Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda must only present a State Department receipt they have applied for a passport through the end of September. But this is much later than it should be. People are standing in line from 2 in the morning. People wait in line to get rock concert tickets, not a passport. I hope the State Department and administration will immediately address this problem.</paragraph>
