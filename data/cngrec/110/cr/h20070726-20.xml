  <narrative>PRESIDENT BUSH, PARDON COMPEAN AND RAMOS -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8623]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of border agents Ramos and Compean, and I believe we should know why U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton has thumbed his nose at a House panel and refuses to testify on why he protected a Mexican drug smuggler over our own border agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnny Sutton gave a confirmed drug runner free access to cross our border on condition he would not smuggle drugs again, but he has. Johnny Sutton found out the witness was running drugs, but still let him testify as an innocent victim. By allowing the drug runner to testify, Johnny Sutton let a known liar testify against our own border agents. Johnny Sutton must testify under oath why he did this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of this new evidence, President Bush should pardon Compean and Ramos today. They did not get a fair trial, and the punishment did not fit the crime. This case is a travesty to our justice system. Fix it, Mr. President.</paragraph>
