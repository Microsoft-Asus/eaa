  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor <bill type="s" number="6">S. 6</bill>, which is the National Energy and Environment Security Act of 2007. This is a message bill that Senator Reid introduced earlier today. It lays out a number of important goals that will guide our thinking and action on energy-related matters, including the issue of global warming, in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk briefly about five key goals that are mentioned in the bill. These goals will be subject to much more detailed discussion in future weeks and to action both in the Energy Committee and, for some issues, in the Environment Committee as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first goal of the bill is to reduce our dependence on foreign and un-&#xD0;sustainable energy sources. Any national energy strategy to reduce that dependence will have to maintain our domestic production of oil and gas as well as undertake three basic initiatives. The first of those initiatives is to greatly increase the efficiency of the cars and trucks that we put on the road in this country. There are a lot of ideas on how to do this. They include several proposals for increased CAFE standards  as well as so-called "feebate" standards that send signals to the market to encourage the production and sale of high efficiency vehicles. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to move these proposals forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another way to reduce our dependence is to further develop alternative fuels, particularly biofuels. In that regard we need to focus on broadening the base of biological feedstocks that are used to make fuels such as ethanol. This is an issue we will be focusing on in the Energy Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A third way is to look at the other new technologies to power our cars and our trucks. There is much promise in hybrid vehicles with larger batteries that can be charged overnight, so-called plug-in hybrids. This sort of technology can help reduce demand for gasoline for short trips and deserves further attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second goal in the bill is to reduce our exposure to the risks of global warming. While there are several Senate committees with great interest in this issue, obviously the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has a primary role and the primary jurisdiction. But over 95 percent of the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and nearly 85 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from energy production, distribution, and use. We want to work with other committees to find the best way to deal  with this important issue and to balance environmental imperatives with the need for reliable and affordable energy into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third goal in the bill is to diversify and expand our use of secure, efficient, and environmentally friendly energy supplies and technologies. Efficiency is a key element in our energy policy. It deserves more attention in this Congress than we have been able to give it before. There are outstanding opportunities to reduce the demands of our future energy system by being more efficient and effective in the ways we distribute and use energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one example, most incandescent light bulbs are only 5 percent efficient, so they waste 95 percent of the energy that goes into them. Fluorescent lighting is only 20 percent efficient. There is no fundamental scientific reason why lighting has to waste so much energy. New technologies are on the horizon that could reach close to 100 percent efficiency. Even if we were to make all lighting in the United States just 50 percent efficient, we would eliminate the need for the equivalent of 70 1000-megawatt  nuclear power plants. Examples like this present a compelling case for pushing energy efficiency, and I expect that we will have a strong focus on these opportunities in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A fourth goal of the bill is to reduce the burdens on consumers of rising energy prices. We need to make sure that programs such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program are fully funded and targeted at low-&#xD0;income and working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fifth goal in the bill is to eliminate unnecessary tax giveaways and prevent energy price gouging and manipulation. We need to take a broad look at the incentives we have in place for energy production on both the tax side and the royalty side, to ensure that we have the most effective mix of incentives going forward. We are all agreed that those are issues that need attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has one of the most favorable set of fiscal policies for production of oil and gas in the world today. Some of those fiscal incentives may be redundant at the price levels we are currently seeing. There are big problems in the royalty system being managed by the Department of the Interior, with some companies getting royalty treatment that Congress never intended them to receive. We will be looking at these issues closely in this new Congress. We will be examining how to rebalance  the system, both from the perspective of having fair and effective royalty and tax policies for oil and gas and from the perspective of having effective tax and other incentives to promote other forms of energy, such as production of electricity from wind solar, geothermal, and renewable sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of this is a tall order for Congress. I predict instead of seeing just one big energy bill, we will be addressing these issues through multiple bills that move through the Senate as issues and proposals for addressing these issues become ripe for action. In the Senate we will not make much progress on energy or environment unless we can develop a strong bipartisan approach on the issues. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has a strong tradition of bipartisan accomplishment that  I plan on continuing in this new Congress. I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator PETE DOMENICI, and all members of the committee as we forge an effective path forward to promote our energy and energy-related environmental security.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is wonderful to see you sitting there and to tell you, as I know you will be very pleased with this news, that <bill type="s" number="6">S. 6</bill>, which has been introduced by Leader Reid, is called the National Energy and Environmental Security Act of 2007. That means Senator Reid is sending a signal to all of us here, both sides of the aisle, that we are going to put the environmental issue back front and center and we are going to put the energy issue front and center and  we are going to do everything we can do to become energy independent and to preserve this planet for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very emotional day for me in a very good way because I am assuming the Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which is a dream come true for me. Since I started my career, the environment has always been one of my signature issues. In California it is a bipartisan signature issue. We all work together, Republicans and Democrats and Independents, because we understand that the health of our planet and the health of our families is very important. America has always taken  the lead. Somehow, recently, we have lost our way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes when I speak about the environment, people are stunned to see that, indeed, Republican Presidents have taken the lead on the environment. Dwight Eisenhower set aside the area that is now part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and said we should not destroy this beautiful part of the world. Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, and then you look at Jimmy Carter who I believe created Superfund. Presidents of both parties worked with Congress to write the Clean  Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--it has been, I think, a backpedaling of environmental laws and regulations that has undermined the bipartisan issue of the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have three goals for this committee. No. 1 is to protect this planet. I think that is our moral obligation. I view it as a spiritual obligation. No. 2 is to protect the health of our families, the health of our children. I view that as a moral obligation and a spiritual obligation. My third goal for the committee is to bring back bipartisanship. We have had, in this great committee, great leaders from both parties. Already I have begun reaching out to Republican friends. Of course we know there  will be disagreements. But I can tell you, and I want to reassure the American people, that we are working together. Today I had an open house at the committee room and in walked my Democratic colleagues and my Republican colleagues. My former chairman, James Inhofe, was the first Senator to come by</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot tell you how good I feel about <bill type="s" number="6">S. 6</bill> because it lays down a marker and it says we have to do something about energy efficiency and we have to do something about global warming. If  we do not act on global warming, our children and our grandchildren will wonder why we walked away from them. How could we have walked away from them? We do not want to walk away from them. I don't know any Member of this Senate who would knowingly walk away from their  future family. Scientists are telling us we need to take action soon in order to avoid dangerous global warming. If we fail to act, we could reach the tipping point with irreversible consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, today I believe we have no choice but to act to slow global warming. We should look at our actions as an insurance policy. Yes, scientists will disagree. Some will say horrific things will happen. Some will say bad things will happen. I don't know of any respected scientist who thinks nothing will happen. But for bad things or horrific things, we need an insurance policy. We need to be conservative. We need to do the most we can do so we protect  those future generations so when they look back at us, they will say: They stepped up and did the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to persuade people to act when the consequences of inaction lie down the road. But we are smart enough, we are wise enough to do something about global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the good news. Whatever we do about global warming, to reduce greenhouse gases, has a beneficial effect on our society. That is why it is something I think we can wrap our arms around. When we do something for energy efficiency, to cut back on the carbon dioxide, what does it mean? It means we save money in our pockets, if we drive fuel-efficient automobiles, alternative fuel vehicles, hybrid vehicles, cellulosic fuel vehicles. It helps us keep money in our pockets. It says we don't have  to rely on foreign countries. So that makes eminent good sense. It means we will be developing technologies that we can export to the rest of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as the incoming Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am embarrassed to say to the people of the United States that of the 56 emitters of greenhouse gases in the order of what they have done to help solve the problem, we are 53 out of 56. Only a few countries have done less than we have done and those countries are China, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. I am embarrassed to stand here and say that to the American people, but I must speak the truth to the American people. We  are the No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases and we are 53rd out of 56 countries in doing something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this is going to change. I think it is going to change because the people want us to change. The people want us to lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look around and see, for example, Wal-Mart--Wal-Mart, with whom I have disagreed on so many labor issues I can't even start to tell you the story about that, but here is what they are doing. They want to sell millions and millions of energy-efficient lightbulbs. These lightbulbs will save so much energy, these lightbulbs will save the consumer so much money, and I am very pleased to see that business is stepping up to the plate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased to see the State of California passing landmark legislation to fight global warming--my State--and doing it on such a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is very exciting for me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a great bill that will be introduced by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders. That will be the same bill written by former Senator Jeffords, a great leader on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, before retirement. I have to try to fill his shoes. This great bill is modeled after the California bill and will tackle this issue in a way which will be good for the environment, good for the health of our families, good for foreign policy, and good for the export  of new technologies, meaning more jobs here. We can do this. We can reduce costs for consumers, for businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy efficiency is the name of the game. It is the easiest way to get more energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone who knows me knows I want to pass the greatest bill in the history of mankind to fight global warming. Everyone knows I want to do that. Everyone knows I want us to go as far as we can go. I am an idealist when it comes to this, but I am also a pragmatist. So we will work our colleagues in the Senate, both sides of the aisle, Republicans, Independents, and Democrats. We will open the committee to all the Senators. We will listen to their ideas. We will listen to their views. We will  take the best of those ideas, we will sit down, and we will work hard and get a bill. That day will come in the near future. At that time, the faith the people have placed in Congress, once again, that faith will be restored. Some of it was lost because in many ways we took our eye off of what we had to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people ask me, What is it like in the Congress, what do you like to do in the Congress, I say, Let's face it, the easiest thing is to do nothing. When you do something, somebody gets nervous about it, but when we have an issue such as global warming, which is a national security threat--and the Pentagon has told us it is a national security threat because if waters rise and there are refugees all over the world, the instability that will follow will be absolutely enormous; it will create  a trend. There are predictions that if we have bad global warming, we will have weather extremes with droughts and floods and all the problems we have been getting a little look at through the lens of the last couple of years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fate has thrown us together, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle. You never know when you will be born or whom you will come to know. I have gotten to know the Senator presiding. I am fortunate to have friends on both sides of the aisle. I am fortunate to have the State that has as its core value protecting God's green Earth and this planet. I am going to bring all that enthusiasm to the committee. I am going to be patient. We are going to listen. We are going to write a bill and  bring it here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to Majority Leader Reid, it means so much to me to have as one of the top bills a bill that uses the word "environment" in the title. I cannot state how long I have been waiting for that. We have it in <bill type="s" number="6">S. 6</bill>. It is called the National Energy and Environment Security Act of 2007. It is an apt name because when we take care of the environment, we are taking care of our own security and the health of our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
