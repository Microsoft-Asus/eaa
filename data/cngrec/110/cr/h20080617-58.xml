  <narrative>INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5459]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Interior approps bill will be in the full committee tomorrow and is, on balance, a very good bill. Chairman Dicks has done a thorough job, with many hearings, and has been very fair in looking at the various elements of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is an energy bill as well, and with gas at $4.089 as a nationwide average, and with great opportunity in the Interior bill, we have done nothing to bring down the price of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, tomorrow, in the full committee, we have a series of amendments that will address the price of gasoline, and I urge all my colleagues to join in the effort to bring down the price of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do this by increasing production in ANWR, in the Outer Continental Shelf. We can start to do the permitting process for oil shale. In every case, we will increase a reliable, environmentally safe supply of oil, and bring down the price of oil for working men and women here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join with us and bring down the price of oil by increasing the supply.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
