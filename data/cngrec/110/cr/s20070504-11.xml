    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I note the passing away of Dr. Art Guenther on April 21, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art Guenther was born April 18, 1931, in Hoboken, NJ. As a kid he loved the outdoors and became New Jersey's youngest Eagle Scout. He wanted to be a forest ranger and hoped to attend a college with a good forestry program, but those schools didn't accept out-of-state students. A teacher had noticed Guenther's aptitude in math and science and got him into Rutgers. There he majored in chemistry, earning his bachelor's degree in 1953.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a grad student at Penn State, he wanted to pursue optics. His thesis advisor asked, "Why optics? The cream is gone," meaning all the good research had been done. Guenther persisted, receiving his Ph.D. in chemistry and physics in 1957. He joined the Air Force and was sent to Kirtland Air Force Base. His mother wondered why they were sending him out of the country on his first assignment. After serving 2 years, he left the Air Force and became a civilian employee and a New Mexican for the  remainder of his life. His optics work would pay off in 1960, after the laser was first demonstrated. As the only person at Kirtland with a background in optics, Guenther was asked by the commander of the research directorate to evaluate lasers for potential Air Force use. He toured the country</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By 1965 Guenther had become one of the world's leading experts in simulating effects of atomic explosions. He also gained experience in advanced optical systems, high-power lasers, high-power microwaves, pulsed power, materials science, and weapons effects. Guenther is considered a pioneer in the development of pulsed-power technology and its defense applications. Dr. Guenther stood out as not only a scientist but someone who was deeply concerned about bettering the lives of New Mexicans by promoting  the spread of science outside the laboratory gates through education and high technology economic development. Art Guenther helped develop an optics curriculum at Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute. The program was so successful it had a waiting list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1980s, Guenther was one of the first to see a high-tech future for New Mexico. Gov. Bruce King in 1981 established the Governor's Technical Excellence Committee, GTEC, with Guenther as a member. King asked GTEC to assess the State's high-tech assets; they found 15,000 Ph.D.s, major research universities and three Federal laboratories along the Rio Grande.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when other States had their Silicon Valley or Research Triangle, it was Guenther who coined the term "Rio Grande Research Corridor." He chaired the State Science and Technology Committee, which proposed and got the five Centers of Technical Excellence in 1983. One of those was the Center for High-Tech Materials at UNM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, Guenther became chief scientist for advanced defense technology at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In that post, he was science adviser to Gov. Garrey Carruthers and again for Gov. Bruce King. In 1991 he became scientific adviser for laboratory development and manager of alliances at Sandia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guenther retired in 1998, but his family and colleagues know he didn't really retire. He became a research professor at UNM's Center for High-Tech Materials and was also on contract with the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. He maintained a staggering schedule of travel, meetings, research and civic involvement. Also in 1998, after identifying a wealth of optics activity in the State, he became co-founder of the New Mexico Optics Industry Association. And through NMOIA, he was instrumental  in founding the Photonics Academy at West Mesa High School. He also helped organize the Directed Energy Professionals Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art received numerous honors and awards. Some of these awards include the Distinguished Executive Rank Award from President Reagan, the Harry Diamond Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, the Director's Award of the International Society of Optical Engineering, the David Richardson Medal of the Optical Society of America, and the Arthur L. Schawlow Medal from the Laser Institute of America in 1983. He has twice received the New Mexico Distinguished Public Service Award.  In 1992 he was one of the first Americans to be named to the Russian Academy of Sciences. He had worked with Russian scientists since the 1960s and was credited with improving communication between the two countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guenther brought so many technical meetings to Albuquerque that he earned a special award from the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau. On April 25, the New Mexico Optics Industry Association honored him with the organization's first Lifetime Service Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my State was blessed by Art Guenther's energy and dedication and we will miss him.</paragraph>
