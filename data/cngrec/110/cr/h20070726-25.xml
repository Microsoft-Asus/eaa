  <speaking speaker="400114" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, Congress declared the atrocities in Darfur to be acts of genocide. Since acknowledging this genocide, we have implemented unilateral sanctions against the Sudanese Government. We've authorized funds for peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance in the region. We've called for concerted international action to end the abominations in Darfur, yet the genocide continuous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been 400,000 people killed, 2.5 million have been forced out of their homes, and 1 million continue to live under the constant threat of bombing, rapes, murder and torture by government troops and the janjaweed militias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International diplomacy has failed to force Sudanese President al-Bashir to stop pursuing his genocidal policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot afford to fail anymore. Every possible means must be employed to pressure the Sudanese Government to allow the rapid deployment of an international peacekeeping force large enough to protect the civilian population in Darfur.</paragraph>
