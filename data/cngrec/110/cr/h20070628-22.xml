  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Last night Iranian citizens burned gas stations in Iran, protesting President Ahmadinejad's gasoline rationing plan. Yes, Iran is running out of gasoline. Despite being a leading OPEC oil producer, Iran is heavily dependent on gasoline from abroad. This is the key weakness of Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iranian government has promised to attack Israel. It is the chief funder of Hezbollah and Hamas. It threw U.N. inspectors out, and says that it is enriching uranium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night Congressman Rob Andrews and I introduced bipartisan legislation, <bill type="h" number="2880">H.R. 2880</bill>, calling for more gasoline restrictions on Iran. After last night's gasoline riots, a policy of the U.S., working with our allies, could become the diplomatic key to bring pressure on Iran to stop funding terror and building nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Running out of gasoline. This is a danger for Iran's rulers and an opportunity for our diplomats.</paragraph>
