    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, November is Military Family Appreciation Month. As many brave men and women fight overseas to protect American families at home, we must not forget to recognize the millions of military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military families lead unique and often challenging lives. They can be separated from their loved ones for months or years at a time. This is offset by extraordinary opportunities of education and travel and meeting new people around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of a three-generation military family, I know these families share a kinship with each other. As a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard and the father of four sons serving in the military, I ask my colleagues to join me in showing our gratitude and appreciation for these families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to recognize and thank the incredible work being done by the South Carolina National Guard Family Readiness Program. Whether it is during times of peace or war, these individuals are always ready to help military families with whatever assistance they may require.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
