  <narrative>Whereas methamphetamine, an easily manufactured drug of the amphetamine group, is a powerful and addictive central nervous system stimulant with long-lasting effects;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Association of Counties found that methamphetamine is the number 1 illegal drug problem for 47 percent of the counties in the United States, a higher percentage than that of any other drug;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 4 out of 5 county sheriffs report that, while local methamphetamine production is down, methamphetamine abuse is not ( 1/2  of the Nation's sheriffs report abuse of the drug has stayed the same and nearly  1/3  say that it has increased);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the highest rates of methamphetamine use among all ethnic groups occur within Native American communities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the consequence of methamphetamine use by many young adults in the Native American community has been death, including methamphetamine-related suicides; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas crime related to methamphetamine abuse continues to increase, with 55 percent of sheriffs reporting increases in robberies and burglaries during the last year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas most illegal methamphetamine available in the United States is produced in large clandestine laboratories in Mexico and smuggled into this country;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas methamphetamine labs are costly to clean up in that every pound of methamphetamine produced can yield up to 5 pounds of toxic waste, representing a public danger to adults and children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the profile of methamphetamine users is changing, as  3/5  of the Nation's sheriffs report increased methamphetamine use by women and  1/2  of the Nation's sheriffs report increased use by teens;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in surveys on the abuse of methamphetamine among teens, many of the respondents said that the drug was easy to get and believed there is little risk in trying it;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas other National Association of Counties surveys have shown that methamphetamine also places significant burdens on local social service and health care resources, increasing out-of-home placements for children, sending more people to public hospital emergency rooms than any other drug, and producing an ever-growing need for methamphetamine treatment programs; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the establishment of a National Methamphetamine Awareness month would increase awareness of methamphetamine and educate the public on effective ways to help prevent methamphetamine use at the Federal, State, and local levels: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) designates November 2007 as "National Methamphetamine Awareness Month" to increase awareness of methamphetamine abuse; and</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 366--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2007 AS &quot;NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE AWARENESS MONTH&quot;, TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Grassley, as well as Senators Alexander, Biden, Bingaman, Bond, Cantwell, Corker, Crapo, Domenici, Graham, Kerry, Levin, Lincoln, Murkowski, Roberts, Salazar, Schumer, Smith, Stabenow, Tester, and Thune in submitting a resolution designating November 2007 as National Methamphetamine Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the sense of the Senate to increase awareness of methamphetamine and call upon the people of the U.S. to observe this month with appropriate methamphetamine educational programs and outreach activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Methamphetamine is devastating families and communities across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been more than 1 year since enactment of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. Methamphetamine lab seizures declined 42 percent nationwide last year, as a result of regulations on the sale of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. These are the over the counter drugs which are often used in the production of methamphetamine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our work is not done. Methamphetamine is still the number one law enforcement problem. The National Association of Counties found that methamphetamine is the number one illegal drug problem for 47 percent of the counties in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four out of five county sheriffs report that while local methamphetamine production is down, methamphetamine abuse is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Methamphetamine users are changing. Three-fifths of the Nation's sheriffs report increased methamphetamine use by women. Half of the Nation's sheriffs report increased use by teens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Surveys on methamphetamine abuse among teens show that many of the respondents said the drug was easy to get, and believed there was little risk in trying it. Methamphetamine is still far too readily available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, local social service and health care resources are stretched thin, and more and more children are being sent to foster homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These issues are even more apparent within tribal communities. I am very concerned that the highest rates of methamphetamine use among all ethnic groups occur within the Native American communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Carl Venne, Crow Tribal Chairman, testified before the Finance Committee. Chairman Venne told of the grave effects of meth on the Apsaalooka Nation. He said, "There is no entity or organization on the Crow Reservation that is exempt from the devastating destruction of Meth."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while the regulations under the Combat Meth Act have stifled meth production here in the United States, the production has shifted to keep up with the ever-growing demand. Most illegal methamphetamine available in the U.S. is produced in large clandestine laboratories in Mexico and smuggled into this country. We must do more to break the meth supply chain at the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do more to end the demand for this devastating drug. We need to redouble our efforts and intensify methamphetamine education, prevention, and treatment. In this way, we show our resolve to bring to an end the problem of meth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, I stand here today, asking my fellow colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in support of designating November 2007 National Methamphetamine Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conducting educational programs and outreach activities in November will give us an opportunity to talk with folks at home and focus on ways to fight methamphetamine across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge everyone to join us in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
