    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as you just heard, this week House Democrats unveiled the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, a bill that reauthorizes SCHIP, ensures millions of children receive the care they need, and protects Medicare for America's seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The introduction of the CHAMP program comes days after the National Governors Association, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, called for urgent action to reauthorize the SCHIP program. Unfortunately, while strengthening SCHIP has broad bipartisan support from our Nation's Governors and in the U.S. Senate, the Bush administration and some congressional Republicans oppose efforts to strengthen the program so it does not continuously run out of money. Instead, they are proposing to underfund  the program significantly, which would cause millions of children to lose coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, insuring America's children is an affordable goal. It costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through SCHIP.</paragraph>
