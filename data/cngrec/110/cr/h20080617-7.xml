  <narrative>RISING GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5414]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's a privilege to come to the well of the House and address this body. It's Tuesday, about 16 minutes to 1 o'clock, and the House is back in session for another week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are going to be taking up some interesting resolutions. <bill type="h" number="1002">H.R. 1002</bill> expresses support for the designation of April 2008 as Public Radio Recognition Month. We are going to take up House Resolution 1029, which congratulates and recognizes Chi-Chi Rodriguez for his continued success on and off the golf course. We are going to rename a post office in Cleveland, Ohio. We are going to rename another post office in Rancho Mirage, California, and we are going to recognize or have a bill that  recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day. That's what is on tap for the House of Representatives today, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What aren't we going to do?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we aren't going to do what my constituents in the Sixth District of Georgia want us to do and what Americans all across this Nation want us to do, and that is to deal with the issue of gas prices, of rising gas prices. For another week, we're not going to deal with that because the leadership in this House, the Democrat leadership in this House, will not allow the bills to come to the floor that will increase American energy for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average gas price in this Nation today, Mr. Speaker, is $4.08 a gallon. In California, it's $4.60 a gallon. In Connecticut, it's $4.38 a gallon. Now, facts are stubborn things, Mr. Speaker, but there are some laws of economics that are driving all of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of it, not all of it, is supply and demand, and there are some other facts that are important for all of us to appreciate. The United States expanded its dependence on foreign members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--that's OPEC, Mr. Speaker--by a full 7 percent in 2007 alone. That means we increased our dependence on foreign oil. The United States is the only developed Nation in the world that forbids, that forbids, Mr. Speaker, safe energy production in its Outer Continental  Shelf. That's deep sea exploration. We are the only developed Nation in the world to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates that America's Outer  Continental Shelf contains nearly 86 billion barrels of oil, 86 billion barrels of oil. How much is that, Mr. Speaker? It's enough oil to replace OPEC imports for 50 years. We can gain that in an environmentally sensitive and sound way without threatening the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On our side of the aisle, for the Republicans, when those votes have come up in the House, 81 percent of us have supported deep sea exploration for American energy for Americans. As for the other side of the aisle, when those votes have come up, 83 percent of House Democrats have opposed this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, as my friend Mr. Westmoreland has said, we are going to break it down pretty simply. Who wants to bring onshore oil on line for Americans? Who wants to bring deep water oil on line for Americans? Who wants to increase refining capacity in America? American energy for Americans, which Members of this body want to do that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've got a petition. We've got the pens at the ready, Mr. Speaker. All it takes is for Members to step up and to find their line and sign, and if they need help finding their line, we'll be glad to help them. It's important. It's important that the American people know that this body, the House of Representatives, appreciates the challenges that they're having right now at the gas pump, with filling up their cars and their vehicles, the difficulty of the truckers across this Nation in delivering  the goods and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's imperative that this House of Representatives addresses the issue of conservation, yes, alternative fuel, yes, but increasing supply. When you hear our friends on the other side of the aisle, they will say, well, there's already land that has been leased to the oil companies, and they aren't using it. Well, you're right. They're not using it because there's no oil underneath it. They need to go where the oil is, and the oil is demonstrated in the deep sea exploration that we ought to allow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to stand here with my colleague who has brought forward the kind of clear evidence that Members of this House can demonstrate to their constituents back home and to their colleagues here in the House. It's time to increase American supply of American energy for Americans. I call on the leadership, on the Speaker of the House and on the leadership of the majority party--the Democrats--to bring those bills forward. Let us vote.</paragraph>
