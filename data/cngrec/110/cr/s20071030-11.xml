    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Senate after a brief absence due to some health issues. I am enormously appreciative to the people of Massachusetts, for all of their thoughts and good wishes and prayers that were extended to me. I am very thankful to so many of our colleagues, on this side of the aisle and on the other side as well, who wished me well. As a matter of fact, there were a number of those on the other side of the aisle who urged me to take even additional  time, that the Senate could function very well without my attendance. I appreciate their good thoughts, but we are back in business and ready to deal with the important issues at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the very important issues at hand is reminding the country of the extraordinary achievement and accomplishment by a magnificent sports team from my home city of Boston, MA. The country knows about it, but I know Senator Kerry joins with me in taking a moment to say how much we are cheering them on, on this magnificent, beautiful day in Boston. Our greatest regret is missing what they call the "rolling rally" that will celebrate the World Series victory of our beloved Red Sox.  It is going to be an absolutely spectacular day in Boston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of us, Senator Kerry and I, are very grateful to the Senate for last night passing this wonderful resolution that expressed all of our feelings about the Boston Red Sox and their success this year. It is an extraordinary record. For the millions of members of the Red Sox nation, this year has been a dream come true. We are proud of the team and what they have accomplished, especially the way they came back after trailing the Cleveland Indians by some three games to one in the American  League Championship Series and went on to win seven straight games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an exciting season full of brilliant performances, but none of them were as touching as the extraordinary--and it was extraordinary--performance by Jon Lester, the great pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, who pitched 5 2/3  shutout innings in game four on Sunday night, less than 1 year after being treated with lymphoma. For thousands of families struggling with cancer, his example is truly an inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Colorado Rockies as well. They showed us what can be achieved when everyone pulls together, winning an incredible 21 out of 22 games to reach the World Series and making history in the process. I have no doubt their team will have a brilliant future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, congratulations, Red Sox, for a job brilliantly done in 2007. It is a wonderful year for baseball in Boston. We are enormously grateful to the whole team for an inspiring and exciting season and we look forward to another great year in 2008.</paragraph>
