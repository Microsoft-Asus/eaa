    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of my longtime friend and staff member, Connie Feuerstein. After working with me for over a decade, Connie has decided to join her husband, Jack, in retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long before joining my staff, Connie was active in her church, community, and Genesee County politics. Her efforts were critical in my successful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996, and I am so fortunate that she was willing to join my congressional staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Connie, her work has always been so much more than just a job. She brings such passion and energy to everything she does. Whether it is attending a community event, walking in a parade or advocating on behalf of a family or for the needs of her community, Connie always gives 110 percent to whatever she is doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a district representative in my congressional offices in Brighton and  Flint and a regional manager in my Flint/Saginaw/Bay office in the Senate, Connie has been my link to the community. She is a respected community leader in her own right. Through the years, she has mentored interns and staff members, many of whom have caught her zeal for public service and have kept in touch with her long after they left the office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My staff and I will miss her sense of humor, boundless energy, optimism and enthusiasm, although I am certain that retirement will not stop her from staying involved. I also know that many people in Michigan, whose lives she touched through her work, will miss her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon leaving the Senate, Connie plans to spend time in Florida, where she will be closer to one of her daughters and her three precious grandchildren. She has a love for life that is contagious and I know her family will appreciate having more of her time and attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am sad because I am losing a trusted and valued member of my staff, but I am happy to see a dear friend move on to new challenges, and I wish her the best of everything.</paragraph>
