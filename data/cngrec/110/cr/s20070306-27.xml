    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor a celebrated American pioneer, a legendary entrepreneur, a devotee, an integral cultivator of uniquely American music, and a great benefactor both to my home State of Ohio and my hometown of Cleveland, the late music executive Ahmet Ertegun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The son of a Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Ertegun arrived in this county in 1935 as a young boy destined for diplomatic service. Yet at an early age he developed a profound love for music, especially jazz and blues, that blossomed into a lifelong, remarkable career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 24, he cofounded the independent Atlantic Records label, mounting a historic and formidable challenge to contemporary industry giants by his keen ability to scout and develop talent. In other words, he knew a winner when he met one. John Coltrane, Ray Charles, and the Rolling Stones are among those in his repertoire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An exemplary immigrant, Ahmet was well known for his "culturally triangular" relationships: He was a Turkish Muslim; many of his fellow executives were Jewish, and many of the artists they produced were African-American Christians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Geffen, the acclaimed entertainment mogul whom Ertegun introduced to the record business, noted that fewer people have had a greater impact on the music industry and that no one loved music more than he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ahmet's deep appreciation and respect for musical roots and history prompted him to establish a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Hall of Fame Foundation was created in 1983, and soon after, its board of trustees began searching for a suitable home for the museum. At that time, about the midpoint of my decade as mayor of Cleveland, a regional renaissance was in full bloom, and Cleveland was making a comeback. The city had a clear vision of our new destiny and knew where we were headed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great people of my city had a dream: to land that Hall of Fame at home, in the heart of rock 'n' roll, right where it belonged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moved by the undaunted initiative of Greater Cleveland civic and business leaders, I joined their determined effort, boarded on a plane to New York, and pitched the idea to Ahmet and his board of trustees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our team's stunning case suddenly made Cleveland a top contender. The news of our heavy impression galvanized the city and evoked a flood of public spirit and support that greeted Ahmet and his board upon their subsequent visit to scout the town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Ahmet never lost his ability to recognize a winner, and when he stepped off the plane in Cleveland, he met one. I had the honor of presenting him with a key to our city and leading him on a local tour, showcasing what we had to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few months later, Ahmet and his board reached a decision, and in their good judgment, they selected Cleveland, where the term "rock 'n' roll" had been coined. We in Cleveland were both proud and humbled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to report, for more than a decade, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland has been a popular global destination and a success for my hometown, for the State of Ohio, and for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fortunate that for a time, my duties in public services dovetailed with Ahmet's vision for the future of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been recognized many times throughout his life. In 1987, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2000, our own U.S. Library of Congress honored him as a living legend. And today, just a few weeks after his death, I recognize him for his indelible contribution to the fabric of our great Nation.</paragraph>
