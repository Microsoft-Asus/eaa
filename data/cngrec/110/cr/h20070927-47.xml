  <narrative>REMARKS MADE BY RUSH LIMBAUGH -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11009]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday House Republicans offered a motion to recommit condemning MoveOn.org for its advertisement stating that General Petraeus had "betrayed us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm wondering if they'll show similar outrage over statements made yesterday by conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Yesterday, Limbaugh called servicemembers who support a withdrawal from Iraq "phony soldiers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is Limbaugh serious? Is a soldier who is honorably serving our Nation in Iraq any less a soldier if he questions what appears to be a never-ending war?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, seven soldiers from the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division wrote an op-ed in the New York Times questioning our continued war efforts, but also stating: "We need not talk about our morale. As committed soldiers we will see this mission through."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, since publication of that op-ed, two of the soldiers have died. As this op-ed shows, soldiers may question the war, but that does not mean that they're any less committed to their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now I wonder if Republicans who showed so much outrage towards MoveOn yesterday will hold Rush Limbaugh to the same standard. And I wouldn't hold your breath.</paragraph>
