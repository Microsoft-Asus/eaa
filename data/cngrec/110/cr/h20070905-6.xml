  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Democrats are taking a new direction in America. We realize that restoring the American Dream begins with a great education. Unfortunately, over the last 6 years affording a 4-year college education has become increasingly difficult, especially for the middle class. That is why this Congress is providing the single largest investment in higher education since the creation of the GI Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We make college more affordable for all Americans by reducing the cost of student loans and increasing the size of Pell Grants, and we do this all with no new cost to the taxpayers. Our investment in college students would be paid for by reducing the excessive Federal subsidies to the student loan industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this new Democratic Congress is working to help restore the American Dream by opening the doors of a college education to more Americans. We need to all work together to raise all boats.</paragraph>
