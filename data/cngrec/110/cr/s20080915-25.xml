  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="Introducing S. 3488. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a tax credit for qualified donations of employee services; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3488">S. 3488</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Serve America Act of 2008. I, along with my good friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, have introduced this legislation in hopes that it will expand service opportunities for people throughout our country. I am pleased to report that it also has the support of Senators MCCAIN, OBAMA, COCHRAN, and DODD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some time I have supported the idea of encouraging our people to give 2-years of volunteer service over the course of their lives. In addition, I have long believed that community and faith-based organizations are doing most of the best work at addressing the needs of our people. And, I might add, they do it at a fraction of what it would cost the Federal Government to do similar work. These are the reasons Senator Kennedy and I have drafted and introduced the Save America Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does many things. Most apparently, it creates new national service corps that will enlist the help of our people to address specific areas of national need, including education, energy efficiency, access to health care, economic opportunity for the disadvantaged and disaster relief. It also encourages individuals and nonprofit groups to come up with new and innovative ways to encourage volunteerism and to use the help of volunteers effectively. In addition, it enlists the help of the  private sector in addressing important needs in our Nation and community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of provisions in this bill that I believe will be of interest particularly to those of us we ascribe to conservative principles. For example, it will benefit thousands of faith-based and religious organizations throughout the country--they are eligible to participate in virtually every new program in the bill. It also preserves a very significant role for State governments at every step. Like many of my colleagues, I would like to see individuals, churches and communities do  more and have the Government do less. While this bill does create new Government programs, the programs are specifically designed to foster this type of volunteer spirit and alleviate the need for bloated Government programs throughout Washington to accomplish the same goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy and I are committed to ensuring that this bill receives broad, bipartisan support, not only among those in Congress, but among the American people as well. Toward that end, Senator Kennedy and I have agreed that, when this bill is considered in the HELP Committee, which is chaired by the gentleman from Massachusetts, we will work with Members of both parties to offset the spending in this bill and ensure that it is budget neutral. I think we have all heard the  cries from our constituents for more fiscal responsibility and discipline in Congress. While this bill does authorize some spending, our commitment to offset these costs will ensure that it will not add to the Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy and I have also introduced the Incentive to Serve Tax Act as a companion piece to the Serve America Act. This bill would provide tax incentives to encourage companies to "donate" their employees' time to charitable service through employer-directed projects. Specifically, the bill would provide companies a tax credit equal to 25 percent of the compensation paid to an employee who performs at least 160 hours of a specified charitable service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, one company presently has a program to provide managerial and educational workers to an underdeveloped school system. This tax incentive would encourage this company to provide even more such service and encourage other companies to utilize their employees with various skills and knowledge to target specific areas that need to be addressed in the communities where those workers live and work. By doing so, everyone benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two bills, I believe, represent efforts that all Members can get behind. As we saw at the Service Nation Summit last night, the Presidential candidates from both parties have expressed their support for this bill and for expanding service opportunities nationwide. Indeed, I think that they both recognize that an investment in the generosity and ingenuity of the American people is a pretty safe bet. I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>September 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR ORRIN: Thank you for all of your work on the Serve America Act and your continued leadership on service issues. I am thrilled to be a partner with you on this critical legislation to expand domestic and international service opportunities for Americans of all ages.</narrative>
  <narrative>I'm confident that together we will win broad, bipartisan support for this legislation in the new Congress. I am grateful for your commitment to work together to ensure the necessary funding to implement these initiatives and existing service programs. I am committed to working with you to achieve these goals while working within budget constraints and ensuring that all the spending in the bill is paid for with adequate offsets. It will require that the new Administration and new Congress make  tough choices, but I think we can both agree that the benefits that will flow to those volunteering and those served will be worth it.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am sorry that I cannot join you in New York for the National Summit and as always you'll represent our cause well. I look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to serve their communities and the nation, while tackling some of the greatest challenges of our day.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
