    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor and congratulate an outstanding community and business leader from my hometown of Cleveland, OH. Virgil E. Brown, Sr., has become a well-recognized name in Cleveland after serving our community and great State of Ohio for nearly three decades. On August 12, 2007, Virgil celebrated his 90th birthday. Also this year, his lovely wife Lurtissia celebrated her  87th birthday, and together they celebrated an  amazing 68 years of marriage. What an accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virgil grew up in humble beginnings. He was born in Louisville, KY, to George and Sarah Brown. He is the eldest of six children. He moved to Cleveland with his parents and siblings when he was 12 years old. He graduated from Central High School in Cleveland in 1937 and attended Fenn College, now Cleveland State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout Virgil's long and distinguished career of public service, he has made history and opened many doors through a number of "firsts" he attained. He served as the first African-American to be the director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections; the first African-American to be elected as a Cuyahoga County commissioner; and the first African-American to serve as director of the Ohio Lottery Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His political career started in 1966 with an unsuccessful bid for a State representative position. He rebounded quickly, however, and in 1967 he won a seat on the Cleveland City Council, where he served for three terms. In 1972, when there was a breakdown in the countywide election system and the position of director of the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections became available, Virgil resigned his city council seat to accept an appointment as director of the Board of Elections. He served nearly  7 years in this position, and during his tenure he restored the integrity and efficiency of the election process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I left the position of Cuyahoga County commissioner to serve as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio in 1979, Virgil was appointed as my replacement. He was reelected and served three additional terms. While in his last term as commissioner, I was serving as Governor, and I asked Virgil if he would serve as the director of the Ohio State Lottery. Virgil graciously accepted, even though he was planning to retire. I appointed him in 1991, and he remained as director until 1995, when he officially retired  at the age of 74.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virgil has had many notable achievements throughout his life. In 1976, he delivered the nominating speech for President Gerald Ford at the Republican National Convention. He was honored by the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners when they named their human services building the Virgil E. Brown Center. In 2002, he was inducted by the Cuyahoga County Republicans into the inaugural class of the James A. Garfield Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Glenville Hall of Fame, the Senior Citizens  Hall of Fame, and the National Forum for Black Public Administrators'--Cleveland chapter--Hall of Fame. He is also a past president of the National Bowling Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virgil has served the greater Cleveland community and the State of Ohio with distinction. Whether it was through his political career, his mentorship of numerous young adults, his tenure on the board of directors for various community based organizations and commissions, through his home church, Bethany Baptist Church, or through his successful insurance company, Virgil Brown has touched and improved the lives of many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout all of his accomplishments, his loving and supportive wife Lurtissia has been by his side. Without a doubt, she has been his greatest blessing. Together they have two children, Veretta Garrison, who is a businesswoman in Connecticut, and Virgil, Jr., who is an attorney in Cleveland and also a member of the State Board of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to thank Virgil E. Brown, Sr., for his exceptional leadership and for serving as a stellar role model. Congratulations, Virgil, on all you have and will continue to achieve. Our lives are better as a result of having been touched by you. May God continue to bless you and your family.</paragraph>
