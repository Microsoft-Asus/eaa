    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to South Dakota rancher Don Hight for being recognized at the Third Annual National Day of the American Cowboy celebration in my home town of Murdo, SD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don was born in Mellette County, SD, in 1920. He served as an Army paratrooper in World War II. After his return from the war, Don married Adeline Fott and together they started ranching in Jones County, SD, where they raised their two children Dan and Cheryl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of 1962, the farmer from small-town South Dakota made national news when he began a 70-mile cattle drive, trailing 1800 head of cattle from his Jones County ranch along the White River to Winner, SD. On the third day into the trip, a blizzard hit with temperatures below zero and  winds reaching 35 miles per hour. As a result of his accomplishing this difficult drive, his story was picked up by the national news and Don was invited to appear  in an episode of "Rawhide" which starred a young Clint Eastwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don Hight displayed his strong patriotism following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when he sold 100 head of calves to the Fort Pierre Livestock and presented the check to the South Dakota Stock Growers to buy beef certificates, which were given to the Salvation Army for distribution to the victim's families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hight is truly a reflection of the American cowboy and proof that the cowboy way of life is still alive and well in South Dakota. He is a man dedicated to his country, and the values that this country represents such as bravery, honor and respect for his fellow man. It is people like Don that make the state of South Dakota such a great place to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me pleasure to rise and pay tribute to Don Hight, a true American cowboy.</paragraph>
