    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill>, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act, and applaud my colleague, Mr. Ruppersberger, for bringing this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $1 silver coins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the writing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the War of 1812. The issuing of this coin will begin during the 2012 calendar year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Star-Spangled Banner" was taken from the poem titled "In Defense of Fort McHenry" written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, a 35-year-old amateur poet and distant cousin of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Key wrote the poem after seeing the bombardment of Fort McHenry at Baltimore, Maryland by the Royal ships in the Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American victory and the sight of the large American flag graciously above the fort came to be known as the Star-Spangled Banner Flag. The Star-Spangled Banner, throughout the course of American history, has played a significant role in the democracy and freedom of this country. It symbolizes our strength and respect for those who  have fallen to preserve the future of our nation. That is why, Mr. Speaker, commemorating the bicentennial of the Star-Spangled  Banner and the War of 1812 is important. I urge all Members to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 4, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN FRANK: I am writing regarding <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill>, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means maintains jurisdiction over bills that raise revenue. <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill> contains a provision that establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill, and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as part of our ongoing understanding regarding commemorative coin bills and in order to expedite this bill for Floor consideration, the Committee will forgo action. This is being done with the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming this understanding with respect to <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill>, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 4, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN RANGEL: I am writing in response to your letter regarding <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill>, the "Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act," which was introduced in the House and referred to the Committee on Financial Services on June 28, 2007. It is my understanding that this bill will be scheduled for floor consideration shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to confirm our mutual understanding on this bill. As you know, section 7 of the bill establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill. I acknowledge your committee's jurisdictional interest in such surcharges as revenue matters. However, I appreciate your willingness to forego committee action on <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill> in order to allow the bill to come to the floor expeditiously. I agree that your decision to forego further action on this bill will not prejudice  the Committee on Ways and Means with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I would support your request for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction should this bill be the subject of a House-Senate conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will include this exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when this bill is considered by the House. Thank you again for your assistance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill>, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act. It is a great honor to be speaking on this bill brought to the floor by the efforts of my friend and colleague from Maryland, Congressman Ruppersberger. I commend the gentleman for his work on this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over 200 years ago, a fateful night gave birth to what is now our national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner." As it is widely known today, Francis Scott Key penned the piece during the War of 1812 after he witnessed the American flag flying resiliently over Fort McHenry after it sustained 25 hours of British bombardment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Mr. Speaker, what is often overlooked is the original title of the poem that Key wrote. The piece was entitled, "In Defense of Fort McHenry." I bring this up because I believe it reveals a larger lesson about our Nation. We are, above all things, Americans, bound to serve and protect one another. What affects one citizen, community, or State affects the entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Fort McHenry came under attack, the brave patriots there fought for its survival, knowing that a nation depends on their efforts. Significantly, the failure of the British navy to take Fort McHenry proved to be the end of the British naval portion of the war. The attack launched from the great navy base on Bermuda had failed, and at nearly the same time a British land attack towards Baltimore faltered as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot imagine a more inspiring sight than what Mr. Key saw that morning as the smoke from the British rockets cleared. After witnessing the fearsome and seemingly endless barrage, he must have imagined the worse. Yet, when he set his eyes upon the land, he saw the American flag, symbolizing the resolve of a nation and preserving the freedoms and ideals in the face of any threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Nation has endured many trials during its history. From its nascent moments of independence, through the sacking of the Capitol and the White House during the War of 1812, to Pearl Harbor and the attacks of 9/11, the United States has not only survived these tests, but has emerged a stronger union because of such adversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter how overwhelming the odds, men and women have put country above all and weathered each storm. And what has always been true is what was true that fateful morning when Francis Scott Key peered through the clearing smoke: This Nation's flag stands proud, a symbol of strength and spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as the coin is concerned, surcharges on the sale of the $1 coins will be used to support bicentennial activities, including education and outreach activities, and preservation and improvements to the sites and structures relating to the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This event was a proud moment in the Nation's history, Mr. Speaker, and <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill> recognizes that fact. I urge immediate passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400349" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Gutierrez and also the gentlewoman from Illinois, Congressman BIGGERT, for your support of this bill. I would also like to thank Chairman Frank for his support, and Congressman Snyder of Arkansas for his tremendous help in gathering support of other Members for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support this legislation to create the Star-Spangled Banner commemorative coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From VFW and American Legion halls across the country, to Little League baseball games, to presidential inaugurations, we play the national anthem to bring Americans together and honor our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hometown of Baltimore is proud to be the home of America's national anthem. In September 1814, Francis Scott Key was held captive aboard a British ship in the Chesapeake Bay during the attack on Baltimore by British forces. The morning after the bombardment by the British navy, he looked out his window and saw a large American flag flying proudly over Fort McHenry. He knew the American forces had successfully defended the city of Baltimore. The next day he penned his famous poem in honor of  that flag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His brother-in-law, Judge Joseph H. Nicholson, set the poem to the tune of a popular British melody. A few days later it was printed in Baltimore and quickly spread to newspapers from New Hampshire to Georgia. The song gained popularity and was often played at public events and 4th of July celebrations. However, it was many years before "The Star-Spangled Banner" became our national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the song be played at military events and other official occasions. By the late 1920s, a consensus formed across the country that America needed a national anthem. John Philip Sousa argued in favor of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and in 1931, President Hoover signed legislation adopting it as the national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though it has been our anthem for more than 75 years, many Americans still don't know the lyrics to this wonderful song of our national anthem. A 2005 survey revealed that only 39 percent of Americans knew all of the words to our national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Anthem Project has worked to educate Americans about our national anthem. Last year, they brought more than 5,000 school children to Washington to sing the anthem at the Washington Monument with the United States Marine Band.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will create a commemorative coin to honor America's  national anthem. This $1 silver coin will be minted for the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812 and will help fund the War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission. It is my hope that this collectible coin will inspire more Americans to learn the lyrics of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and learn more about the War of 1812 and the history of our national anthem, as well as the role Baltimore  played in the history of our national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Mint only creates two commemorative silver coins each year. And I hope that my colleagues will join me in honoring Francis Scott Key and "The Star-Spangled Banner" with a vote for this bill today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="2894">H.R. 2894</bill>, the Star Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start off by thanking the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Rupersberger for introducing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As school children we all learn about the War of 1812 as a turning point in our Nation's history that confirmed that the United States would remain a free and sovereign nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also learn in school that, while being held by the British during the attack on Fort McHenry, just a few short miles from this building, Francis Scott Key was inspired after getting a glimpse at that tattered, but triumphant flag of our young Nation to compose a poem, which later became known as "The Star Spangled Banner," our national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The symbol of the flag served as an inspiration to Francis Scott Key that night and has continued to inspire all Americans ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our flag was still there and is there still.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that this Congress take this opportunity to recognize the historic significance of our national anthem and the battle from which it was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Star Spangled Banner has inspired millions of patriotic Americans to take up the causes of our Nation in times of war and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that many of my colleagues share the same sentiment with me when I say that every time I hear the opening notes of the Star Spangled Banner, I am personally nearly moved to tears.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is so important for us to commemorate the War of 1812 and the Star Spangled Banner by issuing a coin that will stand the test of time, much the same as the national anthem has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am in full support of this bill and ask that every Member of this Congress support it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can never be too patriotic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can never love our country too much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we can never do enough to commemorate the sacrifice that so many have given to protect our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This coin is one small gesture that we can offer to show our commitment to the values that are spoken about in our Nation's anthem: strength, honor, justice, patriotism, and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I encourage all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
