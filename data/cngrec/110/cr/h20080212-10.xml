  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's no surprise that our Nation's economy is struggling. The cities in the 32nd Congressional District that I represent have seen unemployment rates soar to 7.2 percent. Gasoline prices continue to go up above $3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Los Angeles, a family loses a home to foreclosure every hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors seem to be booming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors generated 8.5 million jobs, nearly $1 trillion in revenue for the United States. These jobs are good-paying jobs, and they will not be outsourced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Green Collar Job Act that was signed into law recently will help train 3 million new workers. Through the program, workers included will be those in underserved communities like mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this time of economic turmoil, we need to invest in America and in our workforce. Let's make sure that Congress appropriates the accorded amount of money so that we can create this stream of jobs that will stay here on our shores.</paragraph>
