  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the good news is that we have accomplished a great deal this week. We have had a number of late nights, but we have completed what we needed to do, and today we are going to complete a very important piece of legislation that will certainly make it unnecessary that we be in late today and certainly not tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated to everyone, we are going to have some votes before noon on Monday. But today, everyone should understand that at 10:15 a.m., we will have a vote. There will be no extending that time. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have expressed the desire that if people want to speak about this legislation--the vote will take 15 to 20 minutes--Members will have ample opportunity to speak as long as they want to speak on this very important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to the debate being completed, the vote being completed at 10:15 a.m., and I congratulate both Democrats and Republicans for the work we have been able to accomplish this week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
