    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to speak in honor of the life of Philip Ingegneri, who was a dedicated public servant, a true friend of Maine, and a loving husband and father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 30 years, Phil served his country as a special investigator for the IRS. When the opportunity arose in the 1950s, Phil moved his beloved wife, Rosslyn, and their two young children, Philip and Lois, to Bangor, Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a long and dedicated career serving his country, Phil was elected to the Maine House of Representatives where he dedicated his efforts to improving public education for all of Maine's citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sad to announce that Phil passed away this past Saturday at the age of 97. It is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the House of Representatives his service and contribution to our Nation and the great State of Maine. His dedication and love for his family, community, and country is a fine example for all of us.</paragraph>
