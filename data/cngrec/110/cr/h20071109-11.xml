  <narrative>IRAN WAR GAME -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13416]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my concern that the President might launch a military strike against Iran is well known; but my mission here today is not rhetorical. I am here to propose that Members of Congress participate in an Iran war game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Television could carry the event so the American people can watch it all. We know that the Pentagon has conducted war games to examine the casualties and consequences of a U.S. military strike against Iran. We should, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are some of the questions that could be answered: Could we use bunker buster bombs? Could a U.S. military strike against Iran result in a wider Middle East war? What provocation would cause the President to provoke such a strike?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A group of retired, high-level CIA agents brought this idea to me. These are patriots whom we trusted with keeping and protecting America's secrets. They and others, including a retired Air Force colonel who conducted war games in the Pentagon, would accurately produce a U.S.-Iran war game just as it is done in the Pentagon. I know because they gave me the plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A military strike against Iran would involve life-and-death issues. We need to understand what they would look like. I urge my colleagues and the media to join me in demanding that we publicly conduct a U.S.-Iran war game as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think what we would have learned if we had done it before Iraq.</paragraph>
