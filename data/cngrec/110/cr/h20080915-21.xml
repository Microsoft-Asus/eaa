    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the brave service of LTC Clement C. Van Wagoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LTC Van Wagoner was Michigan's most highly decorated veteran in World War II, earning, amongst other honors, the Combat Infantry Badge, seven Bronze Stars, four Silver Stars, and five Purple Hearts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The awarding of the Combat Infantry Badge reflects the valor of those brave men and women who serve on the front lines in defense of our Nation. The Bronze Star is the fourth highest combat decoration that can be awarded by the U.S. Armed Forces and is given for acts of heroism or meritorious achievement. The Silver Star is awarded for acts of gallantry that have been performed with marked distinction in line of duty. And the Purple Heart, of course, is awarded to members of the Armed Forces  who have been injured or killed while serving our Nation. LTC Van Wagoner's attainment of these decorations, some of the highest our country has to bestow, is indicative of the highly courageous manner in which he served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On D-day, June 6, 1944, LTC Van Wagoner landed on Omaha Beach, along with 1,800 of his fellow members of the 1st Infantry Division, and came away as only one of 32 survivors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The courage to fight on in the face of such peril speaks volumes about the strength of character LTC Van Wagoner possessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fall of 1944, while then a lieutenant, Van Wagoner served in Germany and participated in the battle for the city of Aachen as part of Company A of the 1st Battalion of the 1st Infantry Division. The battle required a fight for the heavily defended "Crucifix Hill" which was riddled with German pillboxes. As the executive officer of Company A, LTC Van Wagoner by all accounts kept his company well organized and was instrumental in the 1st Infantry taking "Crucifix Hill" despite suffering  many casualties. All told, LTC Van Wagoner was in combat for 600 days and was wounded on five separate occasions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the end of the Second World War, he continued to give of himself for his country by commanding a battalion of the Michigan National Guard until his retirement in 1967.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His record of accomplishments should be a reminder to us all of the heroic personal sacrifices that have been made by great Americans in the service of our Nation. That is why it is with great pleasure I bring <bill type="s" number="2339">S. 2339</bill> to the floor today to name the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs new Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Alpena, Michigan, in honor of LTC Van Wagoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lieutenant Colonel Clement C. Van Wagoner Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic, as it will be designated, will help to improve the lives of North Michigan veterans by allowing them to receive health services locally in their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having passed away last spring at the age of 93, it is a fitting tribute for Michigan's most decorated soldier to have the new VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic designated in recognition of his valiant service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues and especially Congressman Stupak of Michigan and Senators Stabenow and Levin of Michigan for introducing this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also with my colleague from California rise in support of Senate bill 2339, a bill that was brought out recently to designate the Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Alpena, Michigan as the Lieutenant Colonel Clement C. Van Wagoner Veterans Affairs Clinic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As pointed out by Dr. Filner, this is a very exceptional individual. Serving in the Army during World War II, LTC Van Wagoner was in combat for 600 days. He was severely wounded on five different occasions and was only one of 32 survivors of the 1,800 soldiers who landed with the 1st Infantry Division at Omaha Beach on D-day. And many of us in this body have been to Omaha Beach. I was there in the 50th anniversary and saw the number of graves there and saw the arduous task involved. And we saw  the film that also showed the amount of work, the number of people that fought and the people who survived. And this is one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LTC Van Wagoner continued to serve his country even after World War II in the Michigan National Guard until he retired in 1967. Now, among the honors he received for his service was the Combat Infantry Badge. That is saying something for him right there. But he also received seven Bronze Stars, seven, four Silver Stars, and obviously five Purple Hearts because being in combat for 600 days and continuing to serve his country, it is not altogether surprising that he would continue to be wounded.  So this is an extraordinary individual. And this bill before us today is naming this clinic after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to my colleague from California, perhaps in the future, under our Veterans' Affairs Committee's rules for bipartisan naming policy for facilities, it would appear that next year we perhaps should reorganize the committee for the 111th Congress and revisit the naming policy, because obviously I think this person should be named under it, but I think under the strict guidelines we've established, it is not quite clear that this would be a naming facility for him. But under the circumstances,  this fellow is very well qualified. I would just remind the chairman that we need to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our actions to approve this bill today will send it to the White House for signature. I urge my colleagues to approve this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
