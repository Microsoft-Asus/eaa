    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today in full support of <bill type="h" number="3043">H.R. 3043</bill>, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. By bringing this bill to the House floor, we demonstrate again the hard work of the Democratic majority to reverse the trend of critical cuts to programs that improve the lives of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes an additional $750 million for the National Institutes of Health, another $400 million for the Social Security Administration to address the backlog of disability cases and reviews and, most dramatically, $2 billion additionally to improve the requirements of No Child Left Behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Head Start will get $75 million in additional funding under this bill. But when you look at it, in real dollar terms, that's actually a decrease. Head Start is widely recognized as one of our most productive education programs. For every dollar that we spend on Head Start we bring in $9 in future benefits in taxes. So the benefits of Head Start do not end just with the preparation for school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I understand there are budgetary constraints but, Mr. Speaker, I hope that in the conference committee we can actually put real money into Head Start.</paragraph>
