    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Good Book tells us if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And this weekend, Sunday specifically, millions of Americans will gather in places large and small in this country to pay a debt of gratitude that we owe to the American soldier. And I rise today like all of those who will gather in ceremonies and parades, surrounding people wearing mothballed uniforms and gray hair, to celebrate Veterans Day. Memorial Day is that day in  the spring when we remember those who did not come home; Veterans Day is the day in the fall when we remember those who did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A close friend of my late father, a combat veteran, said to me once poignantly, I think your dad never got over the guilt of coming home. While we remember those who served and fell this weekend, we will remember those who carry the burden of veterans; who fired shots in anger; who wore the uniform of the United States of America; and who, every day of their lives thereafter, carry the burden of that poignant service and significant loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To veterans all across America and especially those in eastern Indiana, we will remember you this Veterans Day.</paragraph>
