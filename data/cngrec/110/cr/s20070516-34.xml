  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 203--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO USE ITS UNIQUE INFLUENCE AND ECONOMIC LEVERAGE TO STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I rise today to talk about the genocide in Darfur, I ask myself: How long will we wait until we invoke real sanctions on the Sudan? How long will we wait until a hybrid African Union/United Nations peacekeeping force is in place? And how many more reports must we read about how the African Union troops are overstretched, underfunded, and ill-equipped before the international community provides them with the support they need to be effective?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How many more people from Darfur must be driven from their homes and forced to give up their livelihoods before the world says enough is enough? How many more hundreds of thousands of people must die before we do everything--everything--in our power to stop the atrocities? When will we give real meaning to our commitment to the phrase "never again?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 4 years, hundreds of thousands of Darfurians killed, more than 2.5 million people displaced, and some 80,000 people in Darfur who have spilled into refugee camps this year alone, it is time that we act more strategically and effectively to stop the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite our efforts thus far, it is clear that we have seen no real change for the people of Darfur who continue to be attacked and killed. It is time to stop wringing our hands. We must take a hard look at our current policy and ask ourselves: Why, after years of international engagement, has the genocide not stopped in Darfur, and what can we do differently now?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The simple answer is: We must deal with Darfur's economic lifeline, China. Right now, China has unique ties, influence, and leverage over the Sudanese Government. Here we see the Chinese Prime Minister meeting with the Sudanese President in Beijing, the capital of China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has unique ties, influence, and leverage over the Sudanese Government. Because of China's close economic relationship with Khartoum, Sudan is able to expand its infrastructure, increase its defense budget, and profit from its oil exports. It is time to diminish the strength of this lifeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last decade we have watched China and Sudan forge a strong economic partnership. We have here, as I said, a picture of the Chinese Premiere meeting with the Sudanese President last November. China currently has at least $3 billion invested in the Sudanese energy sector for a total of $10 billion since the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China reportedly buys as much as 70 percent of Sudan's oil. They recently canceled over $100 million in Sudanese debt, and they are building vast infrastructure and new government offices for Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has even committed to providing funds so that Khartoum can build a new $20 million Presidential palace. A Presidential palace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, with China as their friend, the impact of international action against the Sudanese Government has been diluted, and the genocide has continued. Because of China's investment and attention, Sudan has reportedly been able to double--double--its defense budget. In fact, according to the Heritage Foundation, Sudan is spending between 60 percent to 80 percent of its oil revenue, its national treasure, on what? On weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A report by Amnesty International released last week concluded that these weapons come from--guess where--China, which has continued its arms sales to the Sudanese Government despite the March 2005 arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, Chinese investment fuels the atrocities taking place in Darfur. It is time that China uses its power and influence over Khartoum to do more than fill its own pocketbook. China is an emerging power on the world stage, and it is time they act accordingly with this responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of their close economic ties with the Sudan, China is in the position to significantly influence Khartoum, and it must use its clout to convince President Bashir to allow a hybrid African Union/United Nations peacekeeping force into Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one of the most pressing actions to help stop the genocide in Darfur. Last year, Chinese President Hu mentioned the peacekeeping with Sudan's President when the two met in Khartoum. But talk is cheap. It is time for real action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As John Prendergast, the senior adviser to the International Crisis Group, said a few weeks ago in testimony before Congress, "Barking without biting is the diplomatic equivalent of giving comfort to the enemy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time to bite. Now is the time for China to use the full weight of its economic influence to change Khartoum's policies. Now, I know China has taken some positive steps in the past to address the crisis in Darfur. They helped facilitate the Addis Ababa framework in November of 2006; they have pledged to provide military engineers to  support African Union peacekeepers in Darfur; and they have appointed a special Africa envoy to focus on Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we are certainly happy to see those positive measures, I am still concerned that China will continue its habit of taking small steps each time the international community turns up the heat but will not take major steps that will affect Darfur in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The simple fact is, China needs to do more to be actively involved in the solution. Next year, we will see China take center stage when it hosts the 2008 Olympic games. Frankly, I find it shocking that China is going to host an Olympics under the theme "One World and One Dream" while they help fuel the economy of a nation that has allowed genocide to ravage its country for some 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is certainly not the "One World One Dream" we share. That is why today I am introducing a bipartisan resolution with Senator Brownback, Senator Feingold, and others, a version of which is also being introduced in the House, to let China know that as much as it cherishes its Olympic moment, the country should be held accountable to act consistently with the Olympic standard of preserving human dignity around the world, including in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics, which is to bring nations and people from all over the world in peace, is incompatible with any actions to support acts of genocide. This legislation specifically calls on China to use its full influence to urge the President of Sudan to allow a robust peacekeeping force into Darfur; to comply with past United Nations Security Council resolutions and the Darfur Peace Agreement, which demand that the Government of the Sudan disarm militias  in Darfur; and to improve the conditions for humanitarian organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also calls on all parties involved in the conflict to adhere to the 2004 ceasefire agreement and to work toward a legitimate peace deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution I am submitting is only a first step. It is an invitation to the Chinese Government to take more of an initiative to set President Bashir on a straight path and allow a hybrid African Union/United Nations force into the country. I hope China takes this opportunity to act now, and that they understand Congress will be watching very closely to see what they actually do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our message for today is clear. We need to see real progress from China on this issue. We need to see it now. Along with stronger measures by the Chinese Government, the United States must continue in its efforts to end the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After threatening more punitive measures for months, the administration must stop talking about what they define as plan B, which is more significant sanctions, and start enacting plan B. If we were stuck in the refugee camps in Darfur in the Sudan, being attacked by the jinjaweit, with our children slaughtered, seeing women raped, who among us would be content with those who counsel patience and delay?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plan B's tightening sanctions against Sudan, targeting individuals responsible for the atrocious acts, and negotiating a new United Nation's Security Council resolution is the right thing to do now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the fact is, the situation in Darfur is a timebomb that could explode at any moment. The humanitarian crisis has become ever more perilous. As we speak today, the number of dead and displaced persons continues to grow, and women and young girls continue to be raped. The refugee crisis continues to worsen. This year alone, at least 80,000 people in Darfur have spilled into refugee camps. The atrocities against these innocent refugees are no longer contained within Sudan, as refugees spill  across borders into eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. The lives of these millions of displaced persons hang in a delicate balance between life and death. The world's largest humanitarian effort has been keeping that balance from tipping completely toward death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new United Nations Humanitarian chief, John Holmes, has warned that if the situation does not get better or if there are more serious incidents involving humanitarian workers, some organizations could start to withdraw and the humanitarian operation could start to unravel. I am deeply concerned we could soon begin to witness a catastrophic collapse of the humanitarian aid effort. Several international aid agencies, including the British group Oxfam, Save the Children Spain, and the United  States-based Mercy Corps, reported in April that they were temporarily suspending their work in Darfur because of attacks. They reported attacks on their operations had increased over the past 3 weeks. Soon only a small number of aid workers may be left in this region, which could result in unimaginable destruction and death. Who would be there to protect these innocent victims? The overstretched and inadequately funded African Union Mission in Sudan?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, chairperson of the African Union Commission said that if the current trend continues, the peacekeeping operation in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. In reality, the African Union Mission may already be in deep jeopardy. According to a Washington Post article published last Sunday:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The African Union's first major peacekeeping mission--once considered the last line of defense for Darfur civilians--has been crippled by funding and equipment shortages, government harassment and an upsurge in armed attacks by rebel forces that last month left seven African troops dead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The setbacks have sapped morale among peacekeepers, many of whom have not been paid for months. It has also compelled the force--which numbered 7,000 troops at its peak--to scale back its patrols and has diminished its capacity to protect civilians, aid workers and its own peacekeepers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, the African Union force alone cannot end the violence in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is imperative that the international community, with the explicit help of the Chinese Government, convince Sudan to allow a hybrid African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force into Darfur. Unfortunately, Khartoum continues to be complicit in allowing the destruction to continue. A recent United Nations report, described in the New York Times, detailed how the Government of Sudan is flying arms and heavy military equipment into Darfur in clear violation of Security Council resolutions.  Even more egregious, the report describes how the Sudanese Government is painting their military planes white to disguise them as United Nations or African Union aircraft. President Bashir has toyed with the international community for long enough. Time and time again he has balked at agreements and promises. Time and time again he has manipulated the international community with last-minute agreements that he reneges on only a minute later. It is time for the games to end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because in this respect, silence in the face of genocide is complicity, we must continue to speak out. "Never again" is an empty promise if we do not take action to stop the murder of innocent people when we know it is happening. Once again, we find ourselves in a position to make that choice. We must choose to exhaust all options until our collective voices are heard and murder ends. We must convince China to use its power and influence over Khartoum to do more than fill its own pocketbook.  We must ensure that rather than standing here a year from now talking about ending genocide in Darfur, we are celebrating a peaceful solution to the 21st century's first, and hopefully last, genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must choose--I urge members of the Senate to join us in this regard--to make sure that when we say "never again," we mean never again.</paragraph>
