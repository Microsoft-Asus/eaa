    <paragraph>Mr. President, I, too, recognize that the Senator from Kansas is on the floor today. I have to admit I was pulling for Kansas because they were very lucky in beating UNLV to get where they are. As a result of their good fortune the night they beat UNLV, I have been pulling for them since. Had it not been for the bad night UNLV had, they may not have made it. All the men on Kansas are 6 feet 5 inches; they are virtual giants. They won and it is a good day for Kansas. I acknowledge it  is the first time Kansas has won in 20 years. They have a great basketball legacy and I wish them many years of good fortune in the future and congratulate Senator Roberts and the Kansas Jayhawks for their great victory last night.</paragraph>
