  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of my former longtime staff members, Carol Mitchell, who for 15 years helped me improve health care delivery and services throughout West Virginia and the Nation. Carol has continued her contributions to public health by working in the private sector for the past 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carol has decided to retire to enjoy more time with her husband David and son Rob. I salute Carol for her 30 years of service to the Congress and for her loyal and conscientious staff work in my office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Carol has worked directly with educators, health care providers and community and business leaders in West Virginia and throughout the country to develop and implement programs which benefit our citizens. She was instrumental in the creation of many of the Federal health and educational programs we know today and possesses a unique understanding of these programs and how institutions can successfully utilize them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carol's Capitol Hill service, includes 6 years on the Senate Appropriations Committee staff and 15 years as a senior staff aide to my West Virginia office. As a professional staff member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, she was a trusted adviser to subcommittee chairman Tom Harkin. She regularly briefed subcommittee members on Federal programs totaling in the billions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to joining the Appropriations Committee as a professional staffer, Carol worked for Senator Robert P. Griffin of Michigan and Congressman William T. Cahill of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carol was an exemplary public servant who has made a significant, positive difference in the lives of many people she may never meet. I thank Carol for her fine service to her country, and wish her well in whatever endeavors she undertakes in her retirement years.</paragraph>
