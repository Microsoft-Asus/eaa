  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Elestine Smith Norman. Born December 12 of 1949 to the late Wilbert and Elese Morton Smith in the Promise Land Area of Greenwood, South Carolina, she is the youngest of five children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She attended the public schools in Greenwood and is a graduate of Piedmont Tech and Limestone College. She was the first in her family to graduate from college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has been married to Pastor Willie Neal Norman for 37 years. Willie is the pastor of Weston Chapel AME Church in Greenwood where Elestine and he have served faithfully for over 18 years. She and Neal have never had any children of their own, but there are lots of folks that would call Elestine their spiritual mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has survived a diagnosis of breast cancer twice in her life and has ministered to many, many others with cancer throughout the years. Her positive attitude through these trials has always inspired others to fight a strong fight. She has trusted faithfully in her Lord Jesus Christ to bring her through the many hardships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, she is a former president of the Greenwood Business and Professional Women's Club. She has served on the Greenwood United Way Board, the Lander University Board of Visitors, and the Piedmont Technical College Board of Visitors. She is also the recipient of the 2007 Women's History Month Government Award from the AME Church for the State of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972 she went to work for then-Congressman of the Third Congressional District of South Carolina, Bryan Dorn. She has continued to work as a senior caseworker in the Greenwood district offices for the following Members: Congressman Butler Derrick and Congressman, now Senator, LINDSEY GRAHAM. She has worked for both Democrat and Republican Congressmen, always putting the love of serving people above politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was elected to succeed Senator Graham as the Representative from the Third Congressional District, I was honored that Elestine agreed to continue her dedicated service in my Greenwood office. Now after 34 years of public service, she has decided to retire. And all these years of compassionate service, she has never lost her heart for people. And I know she will always continue to serve throughout the community for as long as the good Lord keeps her on this Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had these prepared remarks that I wanted to say so I didn't forget anything. But I want to share one short story about Mrs. Elestine Norman. When I was elected in 2002, I knew Elestine had worked for three other Congressmen, and I thought to myself, well, there is no way that she could have the compassion and the fire and the desire to help people. And this lady has proved me wrong time and time again. Her love, her can-do attitude, her sweet spirit, she has been a rock for me,  for my staff, and for all the people of the Third Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Elestine, I hope you're watching tonight. We love you. I love you. We will miss you greatly. Godspeed.</paragraph>
