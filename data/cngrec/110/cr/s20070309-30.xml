    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to support <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill to name the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC, as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. I am the Senate sponsor of the bill, and Senator CORNYN is the cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson was the first President to be elected from the State of Texas, and a man, who throughout his over three decades in public life, contributed immensely to improving and enhancing education for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson was born in Stonewall, TX on August 27, 1908. After graduating from high school, and spending a year as an elevator operator, he began his career in the field of education. In 1927, he borrowed $75, and started attending the Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating in 1930, he devoted a year to teaching mostly Mexican children at the Welhausen School in Cotulla, ninety miles south of San Antonio. Decades later, when he was in the White House, President Johnson reminisced: "I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think  it was then that I made up my mind that this Nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson never did rest--and after serving as a teacher, a principal, and as head of the Texas National Youth Administration, in 1937, he ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was subsequently re-elected to the U.S. House in every election up until 1948, when he was elected to the United States Senate. Later, in 1961, he resigned from the U.S. Senate to become Vice President; and on November 22, 1963, a date that none of us will ever forget, Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson signed two landmark education bills: The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (which authorized the first real Federal assistance to grade school education) and The Higher Education Act (which funded scholarships to undergraduate students).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the same year, President Johnson launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program to provide preschool children from low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his six-year presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson signed a combined total of over 60 education bills. In a very real sense, he was America's first "Education President."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office, President Johnson continued his involvement in education by teaching students while he wrote his memoirs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson passed away on January 22, 1973, and even though it's been 34 years since his passing, he still doesn't have a Federal building in the District of Columbia named after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is time that President Johnson's distinguished service, and particularly, his outstanding work on behalf of education, be recognized in our Nation's capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Naming the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC, as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building is a fitting honor for this smalltown Texas teacher who, after decades of service, went on to become our "Education President."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bills be read the third time, passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc; that the consideration of these items appear separately in the Record, and that any statements thereon be printed in the Record as if read.</paragraph>
