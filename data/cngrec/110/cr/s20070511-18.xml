    <paragraph>Mr. President, last month, this Chamber celebrated a milestone day in the life of our dear colleague, Senator Ted Stevens. On April 13, the senior Senator from Alaska became the longest serving Republican Senator in history. This was an important day for him. It was an historic day for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having served in this Chamber with Senator Stevens for more than four decades, and knowing him as I do, I feel confident that, in a few days, he will be celebrating what to him will be an even more important day. This Saturday, May 12, his lovely, talented, and beloved daughter Lily will graduate from law school. She will receive her Juris Doctor degree from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my heartiest congratulations to Lily, whom I know quite well. I remember her as an infant when her father carried her around the Capitol in a basket. I remember attending the birthday parties that her father gave her. I enjoyed watching her grow up. Now she is the graduate of one of our Nation's most prestigious law schools. And she is ready to embark upon what I am confident will be a rewarding, productive, and most successful career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Knowing Lily as I do, I am sure that she will see her graduation, not as the end, but as just another step in her educational endeavors. As Solon, one of the seven wise men of Greece, observed, "I grow old in the pursuit of learning." Although Lily is a young woman, I am confident that she will grow old "in pursuit of learning."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I congratulate her and wish her the best as she completes an important milestone in her education and her life, and embarks upon the next endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also congratulate her father, Senator Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
