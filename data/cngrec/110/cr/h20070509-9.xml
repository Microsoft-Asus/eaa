    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Johnnie Burton and Terri Shaw, two of President Bush's administration's foxes that have been guarding the henhouse, are stepping down. And now they are gone and the American people are better off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Interior Department, Johnnie Burton let Big Oil drill at taxpayers' expense and got away with it until Congress stepped in, costing the taxpayers billions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Education Department, Terri Shaw is stepping down after several scandals were uncovered in the student loan industry. On her watch, lenders and Education Department officials undermined the student loan program, which millions of students and middle-class families count on to go to college with and achieve their American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day we see another headline and another story. Congress does its oversight job, and another Bush administration official at the center of the storm is eventually forced to step down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House has had an approach of letting the industry govern itself. They cut out the middleman. They are the government industry lobbyists. From our energy and production to our college loans, nothing is out of bounds. And Americans sent a clear message last November. They are tired of corruption. They want a change and an end to business as usual here in Washington. Democrats got the message, and we're restoring accountability to the American people's government.</paragraph>
