  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Clayton W. Williams, Jr., on his receipt of the Conservation Champion Award from the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claytie, as he is affectionately known, is a favorite son of Texas, not only for his business acumen, but also for his unending generosity and tireless volunteerism. The Conservation Champion Award is but the most recent in a long list of honors that have been bestowed upon him for his philanthropic activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, Claytie has been at the forefront of the conservation movement. Recently, Claytie and his wife, Modesta, granted one of the largest conservation easements in Texas history: 60,000 acres spread across two ranches. By doing so, they have set aside this land for future development and preserved the land's unspoiled character, picturesque vistas, and natural habitat forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I congratulate Claytie today, and my words are recorded in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record. It is my wish that this small statement about his service will last as long as the gift he has given to Texas. I hope that in the distant future when we are all long passed away, someone finds these words and realizes that there was not always a movement to preserve open space and there was not always 60,000 acres in southwest Texas kept as pristine as they were 100 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gift Claytie has given the people of Texas will last as long as our Union. We should remember this man of extraordinary vision and foresight for at least that long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his leadership and actions, the State of Texas, and indeed, all of America, is more conscious of its natural heritage, more thoughtful of the land on which we live, and more interested in preserving all of it for the coming generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of my constituents of the 11th District of Texas, I want to express my thanks to Clayton and his wife, Modesta, for his lifetime of generosity, and to congratulate him on the  receipt of the Conservation Champion Award.</paragraph>
