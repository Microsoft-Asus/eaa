  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="HONORING PATROL OFFICER JOHN PAUL MILLER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a dedicated public servant, Officer John Paul Miller of the California Highway Patrol. On the evening of November 16, 2007, while searching for a reported reckless drunk driver, Officer Miller's life was tragically cut short in the line of duty when his patrol vehicle struck a tree on a rural road near Livermore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Miller graduated from the California Highway Patrol Academy in March 2007 and joined the Dublin CHP office soon afterward. Officer Miller dutifully served the citizens and communities of Contra Costa County. Although his time in the uniform was all too short, Officer Miller demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and commitment to helping others, qualities that enabled him to become a respected member of the California Highway Patrol. Officer Miller's colleagues shall always remember  him for his gregarious nature and devotion to serving the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Miller is survived by his wife Stephanie and children, Chandler and Reese. When he was not on duty or  spending time with his beloved family, Officer Miller was an avid sportsman who enjoyed playing basketball, football, and golf. Officer John Paul Miller served the State of California with honor and distinction and fulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. His contributions to law enforcement and the many lives that he touched will serve  as a shining example of his legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We shall always be grateful for Officer Miller's service and the sacrifices he made while serving and protecting the people of California.</paragraph>
