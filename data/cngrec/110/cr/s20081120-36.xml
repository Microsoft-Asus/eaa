  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="GORDON SMITH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I thank you for the opportunity today to pay tribute to a very special man, caring husband and father, and great Senator GORDON SMITH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, he will be leaving this august body soon and returning to private life. The United States Senate will be losing a great leader, a man of high integrity, and a true statesman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GORDON joined the United States Senate in January 1997, after winning an election as a rural conservative in a State defined by a more liberal landscape. After his election, Senator Smith quickly made his mark as someone both sides of the aisle could work with for the good of his State and our Nation. He displayed the characteristics of what I believe makes a truly great Senator--someone who is willing to roll up his sleeves and battle for what he believes is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitment to Oregon was exemplary. He focused on issues that were critical to the citizens of his State including education, health care, natural resources, and bridging the rural-urban divide. Along the way he displayed a true independent streak, bucking his party when he believed he needed to go a different direction for the good of those he represented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith's leadership and abilities were greatly appreciated by the committee members he served with, and the positions he was asked to assume. As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging he presided over critical issues facing our Nation's aging population. In addition, he made tremendous contributions to four additional committees: Commerce, Science,  and Transportation; Energy and Natural Resources; Indian Affairs; and the Finance  Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also selected four times by the leadership of our party to become the Deputy Whip, an important position we could all look to for guidance and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the distinct pleasure of traveling with Senator Smith on two occasions to Iraq to assess the situation first-hand, visit with the troops, and become more intimately familiar with the challenges facing our country overseas. We shared a genuine interest and concern in the events taking place in that country, and I will forever be grateful to Senator Smith for taking that journey with me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before joining the Senate, GORDON made his mark in the business world--assuming the helm of his family's frozen vegetable processing company. His strength and commitment steered this company to new success, and established himself as a business leader with qualities to emulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can't talk about GORDON SMITH without talking about the love he has for people, especially his wonderful family. GORDON and his wife Sharon have raised three wonderful children: Brittany, Garrett, and Morgan. Even while meeting the demands of his job, you always knew his thoughts and actions centered on home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his second term in office, GORDON and Sharon had to face a tragedy almost impossible to bear. Their son, Garrett, lost his battle with depression and grief. As I watched this deeply grieving father, I was so powerfully reminded that life isn't always about what happens in the walls of the United States Capitol but it is about our families, our friends, and the love we share with those closest to our souls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith didn't just let his grief consume him--he took action. Perhaps his proudest accomplishment in Senate service would be the passing of a suicide prevention law, named after his son. This law passed unanimously and has made a real difference in programs across the country that are designed to help those in critical emotional need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am truly grateful that I have had the opportunity to serve with this great man for 12 years. In a town where true friendships can be rare, I have been blessed to find a true friend in GORDON SMITH. Although we didn't always agree, our deepest fundamental beliefs were shaped in the same bedrock of less government, opportunities for all, and integrity in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always knew that whether in times of trouble or success, I had found a true comrade in service, someone I could trust to do what is right and hold fast to the notion of public service for the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert Louis Stevenson stated, "We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend." GORDON has been just that friend to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss working alongside this great Senator, and true American. However, I know that throughout his life he will continue to work for the good of others in whatever endeavors he chooses to follow. I want to wish GORDON and his wife Sharon and their children many years of continued success, happiness and peace as they travel life's path together. Thank you for the opportunity to honor this extraordinary man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today in honor of my good friend, the senior Senator from Virginia. As you know, Senator Warner is retiring at the conclusion of this the 110th Congress, and I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for his friendship and his years of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Warner's retirement marks the end of a career in the service of the United States that has spanned more than 6 decades. JOHN, having been born in 1927 and raised right here in Washington, DC, enlisted in the Navy during World War II in January 1945. After the conclusion of the war, he left the military to pursue a legal education at the University of Virginia, only to rejoin the Navy, this time with the Marines, to serve in the Korean War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1953, he finished his legal studies while still serving in the Marine Corps Reserves and spent the next 7 years as a government attorney, first as a clerk for a U.S. appeals court judge, then as an assistant U.S. attorney. Senator Warner left the public sector in 1960 to pursue a career in private legal practice, though it would not be long until he was called into service again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1969, he was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve as the Under Secretary of the Navy. Just over 3 years later, he succeeded John H. Chafee as the Secretary of the Navy. This, of course, was a unique era in the history of U.S. diplomacy and, as Naval Secretary, JOHN was involved in a number of diplomatic efforts involving the Soviet Union, most notably the Sea Executive Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN's political career began in 1978 when he was elected to represent the State of Virginia in the Senate. He is the second longest serving Senator in Virginia's history and, by a margin of many years, the longest serving Republican from the State. Of course, JOHN and I have crossed paths many times during our years in the Senate. We served together on the HELP Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence. But, for me, one of the most memorable times I shared with JOHN  took place outside the Halls of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the August recess of 1985, my son Jess and I were joined by JOHN and his son on a fishing and boating trip in Utah. During one day of the trip, after returning from a hike, I was surprised to see a ghostly-looking creature sitting in our campsite. As it turned out, JOHN and some of the others had formed a mud hole down near the river, and he had been diving in and out of it. By the time I had returned to the campsite, JOHN was covered head to toe in pumice mud. Apparently,  the mud was good for the skin, but at the time I was unaware of this fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the last day of the trip, JOHN and I were fishing on Lake Powell and I was lucky enough to catch an 8 pound 60 striped bass. He was impressed with my catch and he asked if he could keep it, apparently he wanted it as a trophy. That evening, we flew up north to an event in Deer Valley, UT, but because we didn't have time to change after the flight, we showed up in our fishing clothes. JOHN strode into the fancy ski lodge to meet the shirt-and-tied crowd sporting his jeans and  carrying my fish around with him! Though I can't be certain, it sure seemed like he was proud of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, seriously, Mr. President, Senator Warner will always be remembered for his even-tempered nature and for his work on behalf of our men and women in the military. He has never been one to follow the crowd for partisanship's sake, always choosing to follow his own conscience. I must admit that, over the years, JOHN and I have found ourselves in disagreement over issues that I believed to be of vital importance. But he was always one to respect the views of his colleagues in  either party, even if he went a different way in the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish JOHN and his wife Jeanne the best of luck in all their future endeavors. I think I speak for all my Senate colleagues when I say that the Senate will be a lesser place without JOHN in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today regarding Senator ELIZABETH DOLE, who will be departing from the United States Senate. I have known Senator Dole well and I am sure I am joined by many of my colleagues in saying that she will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Dole has shown her enthusiasm and commitment firsthand through her vast contributions over the last 6 years. Her true courage is the powerful force behind her remarkable public service career. Most important, Senator Dole can conceive and articulate goals that lift people and unite them in the pursuit of objectives worthy of their best efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look back on the challenges of our economy, Senator Dole has become a robust leader in helping our country focus on creating jobs, strengthening national security, improving education, and making quality health care more affordable and accessible. Her initial determination was demonstrated as she graduated from Duke University and Harvard Law School, then entering her public career by serving under multiple U.S. Presidents, including Ronald Regan and George H.W. Bush. Throughout  her career, she served as Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Labor, and head of the American Red Cross. She  continued her public service by bringing her zeal to the Senate as the first female U.S. Senator from North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fellow Senator, ELIZABETH displays qualities of a true southern belle. She is a powerful role model. Her efforts to make North Carolina and America safer, stronger, and healthier have not gone unnoticed. Most importantly, she has played a key role in serving on the Senate Armed Services, Banking, Small Business and Aging Committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I extend my deepest gratitude to Senator Dole. I can say, without reservation, that she is a dedicated public servant and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the departure of my esteemed colleague from New Hampshire, Senator JOHN SUNUNU. I have known Senator Sununu and his family for many years now, and I have worked closely with Senator Sununu since he first joined Congress in 1996 in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate since 2002. Today, I am sure that I am joined by many of my colleagues in saying that his service, his thoughtfulness, and his friendship in this  institution will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often referred to as one of the smartest people in Congress, Senator Sununu earned bachelor of science and master of science degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Setting the bar even higher, he also went on to earn a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University. Armed with that kind of education, it would have been easy for Senator Sununu to spend the rest of his days on a career track that would have compensated  him and his family in ways that most of us only dream about. Instead, after only a few short years in the private sector, Senator Sununu chose to put his mind to work in Congress at solving some of the most pressing problems and issues of our day. It is for that dedication of service to his country to which I pay tribute today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being one of the smartest people in Congress, Senator Sununu also holds the well-known title of being the youngest Senator currently serving in our legislative body. While that feat alone is impressive in its own right, I also like to think of Senator Sununu as one of the most thoughtful Senators currently serving in the Senate. Specifically, Mr. President, I mention Senator Sununu's act of friendship and solidarity in 2005 when he shaved his own hair  and stood alongside our mutual friend, Senator ARLEN SPECTER, as he underwent chemotherapy treatment. A simple act, indeed, but it is one that has not gone unnoticed and it is one that illustrates the thoughtfulness of a man and a Senator who stood by his colleague in a time of great need. It is that compassionate thoughtfulness of which we will all miss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his thoughtful work on energy and climate change legislation to his valued friendship while working together on the Finance Committee, Senator Sununu has done a tremendous job for the people of New Hampshire and our nation. As a colleague, I appreciate his instrumental support of the Flag Desecration Amendment in 2006. As a friend, I convey my highest admiration and respect for what he has been able to accomplish while here in the Senate. It is that spirit of friendship of which  all of us could always gain a little something from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Senator Sununu and his lovely family the best and thank them for the years of service Senator Sununu has been able to provide to this body as a result of their sacrifice. Senator Sununu's journey in the U.S. Senate would not be complete without their support, and I am sure that they will all be happy to have their loving husband and father around the house a little more often. Without hesitation, Mr. President, I can say that our loss is their gain. To Senator</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="WAYNE ALLARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when the final gavel brings an end to the current session of Congress, my good friend Wayne Allard has chosen to retire from the U.S. Senate. I know we will all miss him and the strong and powerful voice he has been for Colorado and the West. His eye for detail and focus on the issues that are of such great importance to his constituents and mine will be very difficult to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne is quite a remarkable guy. He knew at a very young age that he wanted to be a veterinarian and so he directed all his efforts to pursuing that calling. He graduated from Colorado State University with a degree in veterinary medicine and opened a veterinary practice in Loveland, CO, with his wife Joan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he worked at the profession he loved he got to know the people of the area and the problems they faced every day. He wanted to do more than just take care of their animals and livestock, so he started to branch out to a career in politics. He knew he could find the time for both his practice and for politics and the challenge of learning something new interested him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne had one great advantage as he began--his family's deep Colorado roots. Wayne's great-great-grandfather was a trapper and an explorer and he was one of the first permanent settlers of northern Colorado. His family was among the first to move into the area and establish a home there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne grew up on the family ranch. He learned at an early age the importance of a hard day's work and of always doing your best. His days were spent baling hay and helping out with whatever needed to be done around the ranch from dawn to dusk. Life on the ranch taught him a lot and instilled in him the values and principles that have served him well throughout his life and his political career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne is a strong believer in the idea of a citizen-politician. He believes that the more experience we have in the workforce, the better we are able to find legislative solutions to address the problems faced by families across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That philosophy guided Wayne's efforts in the House and helped him win his present seat in the Senate in 1997. That was the same year that I came to Washington and Wayne was one of the first people I met. Our shared commitment to the people of the West made us natural allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was soon after we were sworn in as freshman Senators that Wayne told me about his plans to hold an annual conference to get his constituents more involved in the day-to-day operations of the Government. His dream took shape as the Allard Capital Conference. This annual event gives those who attend an opportunity to learn more about how their Government works, and to share their good ideas about how to change things. When it is over, it sends all those who attend back home to Colorado  with a hefty dose of encouragement to continue the dialogue they began here. It has been a great success and Wayne has been able to attract many of Washington's leaders to participate along with an impressive list of Senators from both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History will show that Wayne has been so successful in the Senate because he is committed to getting things done--and not in making sure he gets the credit. It is another philosophy we share. You can get just about anything done if you don't care who gets the credit for it. Wayne has been a workhorse more than a showhorse and that has always pleased his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Wayne's commitment to fiscal sanity has been so strong and so compelling that it drove him to give up his seats on the Armed Services and Environmental and Public Works Committees to join the Appropriations Committee. From there he took the reins of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee and began the difficult and demanding task of overseeing the construction of the Capitol Visitor Center. Up till then, the project had been the center of a lot of attention because there  were so many cost overruns, delays in its construction, and questions about how the project was being managed. Wayne brought some sanity to the process. He started checking in on the work being done on a regular basis and his oversight brought a much needed sense of accountability</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another area of achievement that Wayne is probably more proud of--and that is his work on the Great Sand Dunes National Park, his successful effort to convert Rocky Flats, which was formerly a nuclear weapons facility, to a national wildlife refuge, and his determination to protect and preserve the area around the Rio Grande River. All these projects were important to him because they enabled him to make a difference back home in Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that his Washington years are drawing to a close, Wayne would be the first to give a lion's share of the credit for all he has accomplished to his wife Joan. She was there from the start, working alongside him in his veterinary clinic and she is still by his side, the most important part of his work in the Senate. They have long been a remarkable team and it can truly be said that he and I both overmarried. Joan has been his best friend, his most trusted adviser, and his wisest political  adviser and counselor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now they will return to Colorado and to the life that they love. I don't know what Wayne's plans are for the future, but I hope and expect I will continue to hear from him whenever he thinks that we just aren't getting it right when it comes to the budget, the environment, or any of the other issues that have driven him during his service in the Senate. Whatever he decides to do, I know we will continue to hear from him and that is something that can only continue to serve us all well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Wayne, for your heartfelt commitment to Colorado and the Nation, for your willingness to serve the people in the Senate and most of all, thank you for your friendship. Diana joins in sending all the best for a continued rich and rewarding life to you and Joan. And Wayne, for me, please keep track of and share the good fishing spots. I know most of them will be in Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to wish Larry Craig all the best as he retires and returns home to his beloved Idaho. I have enjoyed having a chance to work with him on issues of concern to the people of our States. He has been an important part of the work we have done on many of the issues that have come to the floor of the Senate and he will be difficult to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ever since he first arrived in the Senate, Larry has been a champion for the West and a strong and powerful voice on the issues that concern the people of Wyoming and Idaho. His dedication to making his home State a better place to live and his determination to make a difference in the Nation through his service in the Senate has made him a force to be reckoned with for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry has long Idaho roots that date back to his family's arrival in Idaho more than a century ago. He was born on the family ranch that his grandfather had homesteaded back in 1899. The ranch has been the proud home of the Craig family ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometime during the days when Larry was a young man growing up in Idaho, he was bitten by the political bug. It got him started on the path toward what would be a career of public service. Then, in 1974, Larry was elected to the Idaho State Senate. It set him on a path that would take him to the United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his background as a rancher and a farmer, Larry knows the importance of the land and the need for us to be good stewards of all the resources under our control. After all, as we have heard so very often, when it comes to the land, they aren't making any more of it. That is why Larry has always been determined to ensure that Idaho's natural treasures were well taken care of. It is not an exaggeration to say that Larry has been the guardian at the gate to ensure  the Federal Government didn't overstep its boundaries and overregulate the land in Idaho during his watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitment to the land and to the people of Idaho who rely on it for their livelihood particularly showed itself during his service on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He took full advantage of the opportunity to work against any effort that would adversely affect the ability of the people of Idaho to make good use of their State's land. Also on his agenda was the Endangered Species Act and the problems that had come with its application. It was a fight Larry was determined  to win and he did more than just express his concern. He rolled up his sleeves and got to work. The new law he helped to write is not only more effective, but it is also designed to minimize its impact on property rights, employment and our State and local economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years to come I will most remember Larry for his ability to present his case with power and emotion whenever he would speak in committee or on the floor. Larry's speaking and his debating skills are second to none. He has been called one of the most influential of all the western Senators and his conservative style has proven to be one of his greatest strengths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry is probably best known for his work on immigration and his support for the ability of seasonal workers to come to the United States to work on our farms. He knows the importance of developing solutions to tough problems like immigration that do not hurt State economies or make life harder for our family farms and ranches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The habits that he learned on the family ranch have been with him his entire life and that is why you will usually find him hard at work in his garden. It is his favorite activity when he is away from his office and it is one he can share with his grandchildren. As the grandfather of three children myself, I can identify with his interest and the time he sets aside to be with his eight grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking of his favorite hobby, he once said, "My wife knows she's not a golf widow or a skiing or a hunting widow. She's a gardening widow." Larry is also a tremendous artist. His "works" are widely prized and collected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry, I will be sorry to see you and Suzanne leave, saddlebags flapping in the wind as you ride off into the sunset. Now there will be time for all the things you have been putting off for some day, for now there will be plenty of some days for you to share with Suzanne. Diana and I wish you all the best in whatever you choose to do in the coming years. As we have found, the end of one great adventure is only the beginning of the next. So it will be for you. Good luck and God bless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is always a bittersweet moment in time for me when we come to the close of a session of Congress. As the clock counts down the final hours of our legislative activities, it also signals the day when several of our colleagues will be retiring and ending their service in the United States Senate. When the current session ends, one of my good friends and great allies in the Senate will be returning home to his beloved New Mexico. He is Senator Pete Domenici and I know  we will all miss him and his powerful presence in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the months to come, Pete may no longer be serving with us, but he will not be forgotten. He has left his mark on the Senate and on us all in too many ways for us not to remember him and how hard he has been working for the people of New Mexico, the West, and the Nation over the years. Every day he came to the Senate he was focused on what he could do today to make our tomorrows better for us all. The leadership he provided on so many issues will be very difficult to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete began his career right out of college when he was deemed to be a good enough pitcher to be signed by a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team. It was a good life, but it wasn't the one for Pete. He decided after the season was over that baseball wasn't what he wanted to do and so he decided instead to do a different kind of pitching--to the people of the city he lived in. That pitch helped launch him on his true life's work--serving the people of his State and helping to make New Mexico  a better place to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Pete decided to get involved in politics his friends told him he was  making a big mistake. They warned him that it was a tough way to make a living and that it would be a rough life. Politics is a harsh affair, they told him, and they warned him that people would attack him and his reputation. They wondered why a guy who had such great gifts wanted to take on what would be a very difficult challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are very fortunate that Pete didn't take their advice. Instead, he decided to run for the Senate and to bring his case to the people. To no one's surprise they liked what they heard and Pete came to Washington after the 1972 elections. They have been sending him back here with enthusiasm ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not an easy thing to sum up a career in the Senate that has spanned four decades. That is the mark of an individual who has dared to try to achieve great things--and succeeded. He came to the Senate with a great awareness of what needed to be done and with a combination of his own brand of style and substance he has been part of a great effort to make those goals a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking over his record in the Senate, it shows that Pete has been a key player in our work to achieve energy independence. Together with his New Mexico colleague, Jeff Bingaman, Pete worked to bring a national energy bill that seemed doomed to be stalled forever to the floor for a vote and on to the President's desk for his signature. Pete was always willing to work with any Member, no matter their place on the political spectrum, if it meant making progress  on a key issue. That is why I would sum up Pete's career in one word--success. Pete has a knack of finding a way to make things happen and we have all benefited from his abilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For my part, I also worked with him on the Mental Health Parity bill. For too long the provisions of our health care system provided unequally for physical health and mental health problems. Pete knew that was unfair, and he was determined to do something about it. Working together with me and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Senator Edward Kennedy, Pete was able to help bring a bill to the floor that required health insurance  plans that offer mental health coverage to provide it on an equal level with that afforded to physical illnesses. It is a major change in health care coverage that will make life better for millions and millions of Americans. It is a major accomplishment and it will serve as a special part of his legacy of achievements in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the months to come we will also miss Pete's leadership and his wise counsel as we continue to work on the economic problems facing the Nation. Pete is an expert on budget issues and he has served as our Budget Committee chairman. As I have served alongside him over the years, I have appreciated having the opportunity to observe him in action and work with him on measures of concern to us both. He has been a tireless worker in the effort to bring the Nation's expense account  to a biennial budget. He has also fought long and hard to try to put a rein on runaway Federal spending. He was willing to do whatever was necessary to reach an agreement that would balance the budget. He got that done by once again working with Members of both sides of the aisle and a Democrat administration. That was just like him. If there was a way to get something done, Pete usually found it, and the new way he helped develop usually got the bill passed and signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me and for most of us, what I will most remember is Pete's personality and his great warmth. He is a genuine good guy who is very down to Earth. He is a gentle man and a gentleman in every sense of the word. He is a man of great faith who believes that public service is the rent we pay for the space we occupy on God's green Earth. Simply put, he is the kind of person you would want to have for a friend. That is why so many of us treasure his friendship. He is loyal and close to other  Members and to all his staff. He treats his staff like Members of his extended family and not like staff. I think that is why they work so hard for him. They love him like a father because he treats them, as he treats everyone he knows, with kindness and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss if I didn't mention his wife, Nancy. She has been a pillar of strength and a source of great support and encouragement to him in his life. I like to say that Pete and I both overmarried. She has been an essential member of his team since they met and I know he would say that whatever success has come to him in his life he owes in great degree to her influence. She is his greatest friend, his wisest counselor and his closest confidante. Together they have done a tremendous  job for the people of New Mexico and the influence they have had on it can be seen from one corner of the State to the other. She has been a partner in the fight for mental health parity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story is told that when Pete was accepted into law school his father made him a deal. I will finance your law school education, he told him, but only if you agree to my terms. If you do well, I will be proud to pay your way. If you bring home an "F" I will expect to be repaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, my friend, as you return home, your father would be very proud of the report card you will take with you from the Senate and from the people of New Mexico. You have done a great job and everything you have done in your life and in your career you have done very well. You take with us our great praise and an "A" from us all for effort, for the work you have done and for the results you have achieved. God bless and be with you, Pete and Nancy. I know we will all miss you and think  of you often. Make sure you leave your number with us for I know we will be reaching out to you for your advice and thoughtful suggestions in the days to come. That is one thing that will never change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to join with my colleagues in wishing John Warner all the best as he retires from the United States Senate after 30 years of service to the people of Virginia. John has had a long and distinguished career and he will be greatly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like so many of us, John's early years had a great influence on his life and helped to shape his character and mold his destiny. John's father was a surgeon and he saw to it that John's education began at an early age and included samples of just about everything there was to learn. John was soon picking up on a course of study that included math, music, science, Latin and much, much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During those early years, John felt the call to serve his country, so he joined the Navy when he was 17 years old so he could be part of our Nation's heroic effort in World War II. He then joined the Marines in 1950 to be part of our forces fighting the Korean war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John's service in our Armed Forces and his tenure as our Secretary of the Navy has made him one of the Senate's strongest and most knowledgeable voices on the use of our Nation's military. He has been one of the Congress' most respected and most sought after experts on our actions in Iraq, the war against terrorism, and our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. His experience has also made him a leader in the Senate's oversight on defense spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the years, John has been an important part of the debate on global warming. His concern about the issue and the future of our Nation led him to ask us for our good ideas and common sense proposals, regardless of our party affiliation, in an effort to reach a consensus on the issue that would ultimately lead us to a workable solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two important reasons why John has been such a tireless worker on this and other similar issues. John shares my love of the great outdoors and all that it has to offer. He enjoys taking time from his busy schedule to hunt and fish with his grandchildren. He remembers the days he spent with his father taking part in those great activities and he wants to give his grandchildren the same gift. So do I. I think that shows John Warner has a streak of Wyoming in  him and has fished there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years that I have served with John I have always been impressed with his unique style and his ability to present his positions on the issues with great power and force. John has always been one to reach out to members on both sides of the aisle, and his ability to bring us together on the issues has helped us to develop answers to problems that seemed to elude us. I don't  think anyone has a better grasp of the importance of  finding a third way to do things than John. He knows that there are always three ways of beginning our work on the issues. The first two lead to gridlock as they are the extreme positions on the issue. The third way is closer to the middle and has elements in it that everyone can agree on. That is usually what gets things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That has always been John's measure of success. He has never been one who was concerned about making points, he has always been interested in making progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John will always be remembered for the leadership he brought to the Senate on a number of issues that concerned him. As he worked on them all he showed his independence and his willingness to consider all viewpoints to find the one that he thought stood the best chance of succeeding, on the floor and in the field. John would be an excellent diplomat because he knows how to disagree without being disagreeable. He has forged good working relationships with us all and that is why  he has so many friends in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John has been a great public servant and his career shows the results he has been able to achieve in every area of his life. I am proud of his service in the Senate on behalf of the people of Virginia, his service in our Armed Forces, and especially, I am proud to call him my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is always difficult at the end of the session to say goodbye to our colleagues who are retiring. We have worked together for so many years that we will miss their thoughtful suggestions, their well chosen words and their commitment to the issues we have worked on together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For John, the good part of goodbye is the knowledge that we will meet again and, I am sure, we will work together again, laugh again, and continue to enjoy all that life has to offer again. This is not a time to say goodbye, just a reminder to be well until we see each other again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you, John and to Jeanne. You deserve nothing but the best life has to offer and you shall have it. I look forward to the days ahead and a time when we can get out our fishing poles and explore some of Virginia's best rivers and streams. Good luck and God bless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, soon the last remaining items of business on the legislative calendar will be taken up and the current session of Congress will draw to a close. When it does, several of our colleagues will be returning home and leaving public service. We will miss them, their good ideas and the touch of creativity they brought to our work in the Senate during their years of service to the people of their home States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I am asked about the members with whom I have had the privilege to serve during my Senate career, CHUCK HAGEL will certainly come to mind. I don't think anyone has a more interesting life story to tell than CHUCK and certainly few have achieved the level of success he has been able to attain in his public life and in the business world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHUCK grew up in a small Nebraska town where he learned the value of a day's work at an earlier than usual age. CHUCK found his first job when he was only nine and he's been hard at work ever since. When he lost his father at the age of 16 it fell to him, as the oldest child, to help raise the younger ones of his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was also about the time that CHUCK made his first run for office. When he was in high school he decided to run for Student Council President. He knew he would have to do something different in his campaign to separate himself from the others who were running, so he tied a chicken to the hood of his car and drove around the school announcing the reasons why he was in the race. No one had ever seen anything quite like that before and he won quite easily I am sure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his high school years, CHUCK heard the call to serve his country and he and his brother joined the Army and served in Vietnam. He was seriously wounded twice and received two Purple Hearts during his military service. During one of his missions, he and his brother were trapped in their armored personnel carrier when an enemy mine exploded beneath them. CHUCK pulled his unconscious brother to safety and probably saved his life. It took 10 years for him to fully heal from the  effects of the injuries he suffered that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he graduated from the University of Nebraska he began his political career in earnest. He joined the staff of a Republican congressman from Nebraska and impressed him and his staff so much that he steadily rose in responsibility to be his top aide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally impressive has been CHUCK's success as a businessman. He sold almost all he had to begin a cellular phone company with two partners. His hard work and determination to succeed paid off and his investment was multiplied many times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That kind of success would have been enough for most people, but not for CHUCK. CHUCK felt the call to bigger things and he set his sights on going to Washington to make life a little better for the people back home in Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was his platform when CHUCK ran for the Senate in 1996. The experts thought he was a long shot and a lot of people said he didn't stand a chance. Once again, CHUCK defied the odds and relied on the judgment of the people of Nebraska instead of the predictions of the experts. The people of Nebraska knew a good thing when they saw it and CHUCK was sent to the Senate to represent them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHUCK and I were part of the same freshman class and when we arrived we both looked forward to being named to the committees on which we would serve so we could make a difference for our States and the Nation. CHUCK was very pleased and proud when Senator Lugar offered him an invitation to join the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHUCK took full advantage of the opportunity and made it the focus of his efforts in the Senate. He made a point of visiting other countries and meeting with foreign leaders to increase his expertise on foreign policy. Working closely with Senator Lugar and Senator Biden, he has been a voice on the committee that is sought after for his perspective on the issues that involve our relations with other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years I have enjoyed serving with CHUCK and working with him on two of his top priorities, cutting Federal spending and making our tax system more workable and more responsive to the needs of our national economy. He can be very proud of all he has achieved, especially his support of fast track authority so the President could negotiate trade deals that cannot be changed by the Congress. His work in the area of international trade has made a great difference throughout the United  States and helped improve our relationship with our trading partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now CHUCK's Washington years are coming to a close and he will be moving on together with Lilibet to something new and different in their lives. Diana and I have always found that when one great adventure ends another one takes its place. That is our wish for you. Whatever the future holds for you and Lilibet we wish you all the best. The only good part about saying goodbye is the knowledge that you will keep in touch with us and continue to offer your good advice and the unique brand  of common sense that you learned from your service in Washington, your success in your business, and your years growing up in Nebraska, Wyoming's neighbor to the East.</paragraph>
