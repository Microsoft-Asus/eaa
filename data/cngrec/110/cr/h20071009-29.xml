    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to thank Chairman Lantos, as well as my friend Mr. Bilirakis as, I think, acting in place of the ranking member (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for helping me to move this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be the author of <bill type="h" number="2553">H.R. 2553</bill>, the Public Diplomacy Resource Centers Act of 2007. This bill is designed to provide our diplomats abroad with additional tools to show the world the best of American society. In the 110th Congress, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is working to help redeem the status and prestige that the United States has lost around the world in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While U.S. foreign policy clearly is a key factor in how we are viewed  abroad, other factors are also critical to how the United States is viewed around the world. An important point of regaining our rightful leadership role is to find more effective ways to let the world know who we are as Americans and what we stand for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most effective elements of American public policy is the array of libraries and information resource centers around the globe. The facilities run by our State Department provide people in foreign countries the ability to freely access information about the United States, about their own societies, and about science and the arts. For years, these resources have been a testament to the principle that the greatest tool we have against tyranny is the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as we face this moment of tighter budgets, I am afraid that our public diplomacy libraries and resource centers are not getting the support they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have introduced this bill. The bill would not seek to disrupt the efforts that the State Department has under way to organize and run its resource centers. Rather, it would seek to put these efforts on a more stable footing by creating a clear funding stream for the State Department libraries and resource centers abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the bill would establish the Johnny Grant film series as part of the State Department's public diplomacy effort. Johnny Grant is a legendary friend of American entertainment and is known as the honorary mayor of Hollywood for his continued efforts on behalf of the American entertainment industries. He is also an ardent proponent of the power of American film to convey the universal values of freedom and opportunity to others around the world. As of this year, he will have made his  60th trip abroad to entertain our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>By the way, he traveled with Bob Hope often. The Johnny Grant Film Series would provide the United States Government with the opportunity to show the world the optimism and promise of America as portrayed in our classic films.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank both my chairman, Tom Lantos, as well as my cosponsor, the ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for their extraordinary efforts to help me move this legislation forward. I would also like to specifically thank David Abramowitz and Lynne Weil of the majority staff, and Doug Anderson and Sam Stratman of the Republican staff for the kind consideration they showed to me and my staff as we sought to move this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2553">H.R. 2553</bill>, the Public Diplomacy Resource Centers Act of 2007. Every year, thousands of people living overseas visit an American Cultural Center or one of dozens of American Corners that are maintained by our State Department. Those libraries and cultural outposts are indispensable tools in our public diplomacy efforts around the world. They help foreign audiences better understand our Nation, our people, our government, and our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today will strengthen this American outreach by establishing a new film series and by requiring a report to Congress analyzing the effectiveness of libraries and resource centers. Also, by providing specific statutory authority for the establishment and maintenance of these centers, this bill will create an annual appropriations line item, which will allow Congress to oversee these activities in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California, my good friend, Ambassador Watson, and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, for introducing this measure, which deserves our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2553">H.R. 2553</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
