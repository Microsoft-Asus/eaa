  <narrative>HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE MEETING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10906]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. HARE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic Congress is taking our Nation in a new direction by putting the needs of the American people first and making long delayed investments in our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the summer, the House passed every single one of its appropriations bills for the upcoming year. Our appropriation priorities will better protect the Nation against terrorism by including 3,500 more firefighting grants and better protect our neighborhoods against violent crime by investing in 12,000 new police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also invest in community health centers so that they can provide essential health care services to more than 1 million additional Americans. We beefed up cancer and other lifesaving medical research so that we can continue to look for cures for these devastating diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we make the largest investment in veterans health care funding in the history of the Veterans Administration, ensuring that our veterans get the health care they are entitled to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we once again invest in priorities that were neglected by the old Republican Congress, and we do it in a fiscally responsible way following pay-as-you-go policies that will lead us to no new deficit spending.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
