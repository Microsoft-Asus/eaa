For a month now, it has been sitting at the desk in the House awaiting action. Would it have been in order for the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence or the chairman of the Judiciary Committee or their designee to call up <bill type="s" number="2248">S. 2248</bill> at this time?</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5440">H.R. 5440</bill>, the House counterpart to this bipartisan Senate legislation, was introduced by Congressman Fossella on February 14. Would it be possible for Mr. Hoekstra, the ranking member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to call up this bill under his committee's jurisdiction or for any of the 21 members of the Democrat majority who signed a letter to Speaker Pelosi on January 28 asking her to move this legislation to "ensure a strong national  security apparatus that can thwart terrorist attacks across the globe and to save American lives here in this country," for them to call up this bill?</paragraph>
