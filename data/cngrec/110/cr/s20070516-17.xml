    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to recognize the dedicated efforts of the students at Orofino High School who came to Washington to represent Idaho in the finals of the annual We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national finals include a hearing which gives the students the opportunity to apply their specialized learning in history, social studies, government, and civics during "testimony" before a panel of judges. As they use their newly gained knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to examine, counter, and defend issues facing America today, students come to appreciate the timeless nature of this great document. This experience gives young people the opportunity to apply civic values  to real-life challenges and serves them in whatever they choose to do after they graduate from high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Orofino High School was excellently represented by Jennifer Cluck, Justin Haag, Gary Hardin, George Korbel, Nathan LeBaron, Ryan Lundgren, Madison Morrow, Eric Petersen, Jessica Robbeloth, Ashley Roshitsh, Capri Savage, Kelsey Stemrich, and Bret Zender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cindy Wilson, the teacher who prepared these exceptional students, deserves recognition for her tremendous efforts. Also worthy of special recognition is Peter Kavouras, the State coordinator, who is among those responsible for implementing the We the People Program in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Idahoans can be proud of the growth of civic virtue in their young people. As they look beyond themselves to the realm of the public good, Idaho and America will benefit as these individuals develop into responsible, intelligent citizens who practice discernment in judgment in matters of concern to our State and Nation. In the future, these student citizens will be more inclined to exhibit leadership faithful to the ideals upon which our country was built and consonant with the notions of liberty,  freedom, justice, and rule of law.</paragraph>
