    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National Disability Employment Awareness Month, NDEAM. Designated by Congress, this month is observed every October to increase the public's understanding of issues involving individuals with disabilities and their role in America's workforce. It is a time for us to reflect on past gains and goals for the future as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen years ago, I commended the passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, to help ensure the rights of people with disabilities throughout various sectors of society. Together with other Federal laws like the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the ADA has been key to the progress made toward the full inclusion of people with disabilities in daily life. We see reasons to cheer today, as more people with disabilities succeed  in school, enter the workforce, and participate in their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More remains to be done, however. When Nevadans with disabilities share their experiences with me, I hear many of the same struggles and challenges in their stories. Employment is an issue especially foremost on their minds, as it is for any person who wants to pursue the American dream. And like all Americans, individuals with disabilities deserve a fair shot to achieve as much success as their abilities and determination will allow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am heartened that this sense is spreading throughout the general public, beyond those of us who see the positive contributions that Americans with disabilities make as employees and coworkers every day. Much of the increase in awareness is due to local organizations, such as Nevada JobConnect, Opportunity Village, the Southern Nevada Center for Independent Living, SNCIL, and the Northern Nevada Center for Independent Living. This year for example, SNCIL is partnering with the City of Las Vegas  to sponsor the 16th Annual Disability Awareness Day on October 20. Similar events are expected to be held across the country in observance of National Disability Employment Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While improving awareness is critical, especially for dispelling false stereotypes about people with disabilities, it isn't enough. Disparities on a wide range of economic and social dimensions point to significant barriers that remain for people with disabilities who want a good job to give them not just an income, but also dignity and independence. From listening to my constituents in Nevada, I also know that the incentives between employment, health care benefits, and eligibility for government-sponsored  programs can interact in very problematic ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported the passage of new laws to address these issues, such as the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act to give people with disabilities greater access to Medicaid or Medicare coverage when they go to work. I was also pleased when Congress passed the Family Opportunity Act to allow more children with disabilities to enroll in Medicaid, thereby alleviating an unfair pressure on their parents to forgo better jobs just to keep their family health coverage. Looking ahead to the  future, I will continue working to make sure that people with disabilities can access the health care they need, especially as they seek to move to economic self-sufficiency. We should not lose sight of other key priorities as well, including opening more doors to education and expanding employment opportunities for those able to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we observe National Disability Employment Awareness Month this year, let us reaffirm the importance of its ideals and goals. From employers to policymakers, family members to people with disabilities themselves, all Americans can join in the effort to ensure that individuals with disabilities make the most of their potential--in the workplace and in all areas of society.</paragraph>
