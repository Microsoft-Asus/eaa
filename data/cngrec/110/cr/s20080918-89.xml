  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in recess until Monday, September 22, at 3 p.m.; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would further say, one reason we are not going to be in session tomorrow is we are waiting to get a response from the administration as to what they think should be done as the next step in the financial problems we have facing this country. We need to hear from them. So there is no objection to my request, Mr. President?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
