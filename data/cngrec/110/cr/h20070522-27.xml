    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many of my friends ask me as we struggle to fund this war, why are the Iraqi Parliamentarians going on a 2-month vacation? The answer is very simple: Self-preservation. The AP reported that "a few shells" fell in the Green Zone last weekend. Well, my sources in Amman and in Baghdad told me that 47 mortar rounds landed in the Green Zone on Sunday, and on Monday they hit the parliament building, destroying the office of Dr. Mashhadani 5 minutes after he left  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AP also reports that the Defense Minister, Mr. Obeidi, has told reporters that Iraq's military was drawing up plans in case U.S. forces left the country quickly. "The army plans on the basis of a worst case scenario so as not to allow any security vacuum. There are meetings with political leaders on how we can deal with the sudden pullout."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It sounds to me like we are looking at off-the-hotel-roof in Vietnam, or maybe it was the pullout from Beirut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish, Mr. Speaker, we could make the President be honest with us about what he is actually planning. The world can't figure it out.</paragraph>
