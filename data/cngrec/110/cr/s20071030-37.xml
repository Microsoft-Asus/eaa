    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a key institution in my State, the South Dakota Community Foundation, SDCF, which will celebrate its 20th anniversary on November 11, 2007. This statewide organization is a perfect example of how private funds are raised in communities to ensure future sustainability. The SDCF is a model for those who believe there is no better way to improve themselves and our great State than through working together to accomplish  great things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SDCF was started two decades ago by a group of leaders with a vision for South Dakota. Their vision included capitalizing on the philanthropic nature of South Dakotans to help rural communities redevelop and serve the needs of their citizens. Strong leadership over 20 years has resulted in thousands of investors and partners that have assisted local communities and nonprofit organizations to achieve new levels of success. The original group of investors was especially critical, as they embraced  a concept that has now exceeded the expectations of many. Over 70 communities and hundreds of nonprofit organizations across South Dakota now have direct partnerships with the SDCF.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty years ago, under the direct leadership of our late Governor George S. Mickelson, the SDCF was created. I wish that Governor Mickelson were alive today to witness the lasting legacy his initiatives have given to our State. The SDCF continues to meet the visionary goals of Governor Mickelson, and remains committed to taking the organization to levels unanticipated 20 years ago. Governor Mickelson's widow, Linda Mickelson Graham, served in a leadership role on the SDCF board of directors  for nine years, and their oldest son, Mark Mickelson, is set to become chairman of the board in 2009. Governor Mickelson's dream is alive and well within the SDCF and across South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original funding for the SDCF came from generous gifts from the McKnight Foundation and the 3M Foundation. On their way to raising the first $10 million, the 3M Foundation and the State of South Dakota contributed $2 million each, and the McKnight Foundation added $3 million as a challenge grant. Using this seed money as an incentive, Governor Mickelson and then-SDCF Executive Director Bernie Christenson raised an additional $3 million within 1 year to fully fund the first phase of the SDCF.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the SDCF has grown to over $70 million in total assets. Over 360 funds have been established by communities, families, nonprofit organizations, and businesses to benefit South Dakota in perpetuity. These funds provide support for nonprofit causes benefiting children, senior citizens, and individuals with special needs. South Dakotans from rural areas, Indian reservations, and our largest cities are reaping the benefits of this visionary plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leadership has been a key component to the success of the SDCF. The original leadership to get the SDCF started, the continued leadership of the board members, and dedicated staff have all played and integral role. Current Chairman of the Board John E. Johnson, President Bob Sutton, and the current board leadership have set goals for the continued growth of the organization. This growth would not be possible without committed staff members, and two of them--Stephanie Judson and Ginger Niemann--have  20 years of combined service to the SDCF. The relationships they have built with donors and partners of the SDCF over the years are invaluable, and they deserve credit for a job very well done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The future for the SDCF is bright. Over the next 5 years, the organization will grow to over $100 million in permanently endowed assets. This will result in $5 million annually being distributed to nonprofit and charitable causes in South Dakota. This commitment to human service, economic development, and cultural and educational organizations in South Dakota will leave a lasting legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the SDCF has come from many areas, including unmatched public/private partnerships, strong nonprofit organizations, local community leaders, generous contributors, and prudent fiscal management. On the local level, a new generation of leaders has been developed, with many communities finding the future resting in the hands of these individuals. Through the establishment of permanent endowment funds, these local leaders are able to envision what their communities  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="13577">S13577</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I extend my hearty congratulations to the SDCF as the organization celebrates 20 years of "Success Through Community Caring" in South Dakota. As the work of the SDCF continues, I look forward to celebrating another 20 years of success in 2027.</paragraph>
