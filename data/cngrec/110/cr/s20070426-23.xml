    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Munster. Shaun Blue, 25 years old, died on April 16 while deployed in Al Anbar Province on Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Shaun risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shaun was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating among the top 10 students of his class from Munster High School in 2000. He joined the military because, as his high school principal said, "He was one of those kids who did things everyone else was afraid to do." His valor over the course of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. His track and field coach at Munster High described Shaun as a mentally tough kid saying, "The fact that he chose the career path that he did didn't surprise  me. It was perfectly suited for him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shaun was killed by an improvised explosive device while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Twenty-nine Palms, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Shaun's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Shaun, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shaun was known for his dedication to his community and his love of country. Today and always, Shaun will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shaun's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Shaun's actions will live on far longer that any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shaun M. Blue in the official Record of the Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Shaun's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from  off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Shaun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo. Neil Simmons, 20 years old, was killed on April 8th while deployed in Baghdad, when his convoy encountered an improvised explosive device and insurgent fire. He had been in Iraq for less than 2 weeks. With his entire life before him, Neil risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Neil attended Kokomo's Northwestern High School and followed the example set by his father and uncle by enlisting in the Army a few months before graduating in 2005. He enjoyed the structure of the military and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and country. His father described Neil as "an avid outdoorsman who was happy and always had plenty of friends."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Neil was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, in Fort Benning, GA. Neil's father reflected on his son's death, asking, "What's the odds of, among 160,000 troops your only child is there 1 week and gets killed?" Private First Class Simmons leaves behind his father, David, and uncle, Jim Simmons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Neil's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Neil, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Neil was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. Today and always, Neil will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Neil's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of David Neil Simmons in the official Record of the United States Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope families like Neil's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe  away tears from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Neil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from La Porte. Jason Beadles, 22 years old, died on April 11th while deployed in Baghdad on Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Jason risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason has been a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from La Porte High School in 2003. He had been interested in technical engineering throughout high school, earning his welding certificate from A.K. Smith Career Center before graduating. Army Specialist Beadles enlisted in the Army as an engineer after the attacks of 9/11. His valor over the course of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. He decided to enlist because as his welding instructor put it, "he was always concerned  about other people." Jason enjoyed the military, and he believed that throughout all the hardships they faced he and his company were helping the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 887th Engineer Company, 326th Engineer Battalion, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), in Fort Campbell, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Jason's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Jason, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Fort Wayne. Richard Langenbrunner, 19 years old, was killed on April 17 while deployed in Rustamiyah, Iraq. With his entire life before him, Richard risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Northrop High School in 2006. He completed basic training this past January and was deployed just a few weeks later. He is remembered for his love of people, life, and adventure. "He was so happy and excited about his future before he graduated," said a former classmate. "He joined the military because he wanted to drive a tanker." Richard enlisted in the Army just before graduating high school. His valor over the course of his service in Iraq  exemplifies Hoosier values and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Richard's family and friends in mourning his death.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Gas City. Bradley King, 28 years old, was killed on April 2 while deployed in Al Amiriyah, Iraq, when a roadside bomb exploded near his Humvee. With his entire life before him, Bradley risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bradley attended Mississinewa High School, enlisting in the National Guard in 1997, a year before his graduation in 1998. Bradley enjoyed the military and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and country. The day before he was deployed, Bradley told his mother that he felt "called to serve in the military for his country." His aunt described Bradley as "a responsible young man determined to do his best for the people he loved."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bradley was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, 76th Infantry Brigade, Marion, IN. Master Sergeant Bill Wallen, King's supervisor, told local media, "he was a heck of a human being, he's what everybody else needs to be in this world." Staff Sergeant King leaves behind his wife Adrian and 15-month-old son, Daethan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Bradley's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Bradley, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Lafayette. Cody Putman, 22 years old, was killed on April 11th while deployed in Baghdad on Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Cody risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cody was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Twin Lakes High School in 2003. He is remembered for his love of  people, life, and adventure. "He was someone who was always looking to have a good time with others," said a former teacher. "He joined the military because of the teamwork." Cody enlisted in the Army after high school, and his valor over the course of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. A month before he died, Cody  had been home on leave for 2 weeks vacationing with his family in Florida. Cody is survived by his father, Harry Putman, and his mother, Pam Mow. He also leaves behind his wife, Molly Putnam, 20, and 3-year-old daughter Madelyn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cody died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, based in Fort Richardson, AK.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="SPECIALIST ERIC R. SIEGER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to SPC Eric R. Sieger of Layton, UT, who died of injuries suffered while conducting operations in Iraq. He was a remarkable young man who overcame much adversity in his life. On March 9 of this year, he would have turned 19 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the 1st Cavalry Division, Specialist Sieger was also a member of a very special family. I understand that his parents, Wolfgang and Krista, have 15 children, 6 of whom were adopted, including the Specialist. Early life was not easy for the Specialist but that all changed when he was adopted at the age of 11 by the loving Sieger family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been informed that Specialist Sieger enjoyed running, being with his friends, building and fixing things. He had a girlfriend whom he met while stationed at Fort Hood, TX. Shortly before his passing, Specialist Sieger was able speak to his mother on the phone. His mother said, "They spent most of the time laughing and joking with each other."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Sieger's father said, "He was dutiful in wanting to do what is right."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Undoubtedly, this led him to become a member of the Civil Air Patrol as a teenager and enlist in the Army at 17. Military service is a calling for other members of the Sieger family, as well. Currently, one of his sisters is also deployed to Iraq, another sister is preparing to deploy, and a brother is a member of the Air National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to conclude my remarks by quoting the words of Specialist Sieger's mother and father. Krista Sieger stated, "He felt since he was in the Army, since he took the oath, he has to do everything he was asked to do. And he did." Wolfgang Sieger said, "I would call him a hero. He is definitely a hero in my sight. I honor him as a hero."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not know of any higher praise that parents could give a son in military service. Specialist Sieger and his family will always be in my prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor one of Utah's fallen sons, SFC First Class Douglas C. Stone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SFC Stone had a lifelong connection to our Nation's military. His father served in the Air Force. Yet, SFC Douglas Stone joined the Army Reserve later in life. As his mother Dolores Feigley said about her son, "I think he was the oldest at boot camp."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, his maturity was only to be an asset to his country, which was affirmed when he became a full-time reservist. Over the past 6 years, SFC Douglas Stone assisted in the preparation of reservists from the 96th Regional Readiness Command for deployments in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. As my good friend, MG Peter S. Cooke, the commanding officer of the 96th Regional Readiness Command said about SFC Stone "There wasn't a unit or individual sent from our headquarters  that SFC Stone did not personally assist in preparing for their mobilization or deployment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was not the first time SFC Douglas Stone had gone in harm's way for his country. He also was a part of the fuel re-supply effort during the First Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, his life's most important work undoubtedly was as a family man. Sergeant First Class Stone was husband to his wife, Mary, and father to two boys Nathan, 13, and Cameron, 10.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SFC Douglas Stone was also a member of Fort Douglas's Honor Guard. I understand that Rick Edginton, one of his fellow Honor Guardsmen who participated at his friend's funeral said, "for me, probably one of the toughest moments was when I was standing at the head of the casket and I looked over to the side and I saw a note from his sister on the flowers that were there. It said, "To Doug, my brother, and my Hero.""</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No truer words have been written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SFC Douglas Stone was a hero. He served his country with pride and answered its call when it needed him most. All of Utah shall remember him and will be praying for this hero and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to SGT Brandon A. Parr. Sergeant Parr was a member of the 630th Military Police Company and gave his life with two other servicemembers when their vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are certain pictures that define a time and a moment in our Nation's history. Such examples can be found in the raising of Old Glory over Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima. I respectfully submit that a picture taken during Sergeant Parr's funeral should be added to that category. In that photo, Sergeant Parr's wife, Shannah, is seen holding the hand of their young son, Nicholas. Nicholas, standing on some steps, is wearing the camouflage uniform of an American soldier--a young son's tribute to  his fallen father. This is an image that I will remember for all my days and a fitting tribute to a true hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Parr enlisted in the Army in 2003, and this was his second tour in Iraq. He was involved in one of the most critical tasks in this war: training Iraqi police and providing security to the Iraqi people. By all accounts, Sergeant Parr preformed these assignments at the highest standards of our Nation's military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shannah Parr said of her husband, "He was very laid back and very funny. He made everyone feel good."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His mother, Teota Dangel said, "I think he would have gone (to Iraq) even if he knew this was going to be the outcome." Words like this can only be spoken of a true hero and patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Parr and his entire family will always be in my prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to CPL Stephen Kowalczyk, a member  of the 1st Calvary Division, who recently lost his life while on patrol in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon learning of about his life, I was struck by all the adventures that Corporal Kowalczyk had undertaken. He had been the captain of the swim team at Macalester College, traveled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East, including working as a handyman in Jerusalem. I understand that he even leapt from an iceberg and swam in the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean. Clearly, this was a young man that seized all that life had to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three years ago, at the age of 29, he began a new adventure and joined the Army. According to his family he loved it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a recent memorial service in Iraq, one of his comrades SSG Richard Coombes stated: "He was a man who taught me that there was still beauty in our everyday life, even in Iraq. I looked at him and wondered if he had already figured life out. He was in such peace and harmony." CPT Kevin Bradley would often notice that Corporal Kowalczyk would look from the roof-tops at the area around him. When asked why, he reportedly would reply, "You should see it up here. It's beautiful." Another  friend remembered him as "a gentle, kind soul, I cannot think of anybody who did not love this man."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet he never forgot why he was deployed to Iraq--to help the Iraqi people. This commitment was reflected in the letters that he would write home asking for history books that he could give to Iraqis that he met, and pencils, notepads, and Hershey bars for Iraqi children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a fine man. What an extraordinary life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always remember him and his family in my prayers.</paragraph>
