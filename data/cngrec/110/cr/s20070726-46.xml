  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this week New Jersey lost one of its great citizens when Judge David A. Waks passed away far too early in life at 66 years of age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known the Waks family over a number of years and his son, Joe Waks, carries on a proud family tradition of public service as chief of staff of my Senate operations in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Waks was respected and admired for his candid, forthright action on decency and integrity in Government service. Known as someone who had a sympathetic ear and a generous heart, so much so that when a person in serious need sought his help he would reach into his own limited resources to assist. He was a model of a compassionate public servant who all in public service should emulate. Anyone who had the good fortune to know him was inspired by his genuine affection and concern. His life  was exemplary and I wanted to ensure that a permanent record of David Waks' life existed as an outstanding example of how public service can be ennobled by the right kind of leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that an article from the Herald News be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article follows</paragraph>

  <narrative>WAYNE.--David A. Waks, who championed integrity in public service for almost 40 years, first as a councilman, then as mayor in Wayne, and later as a state Superior Court judge in Paterson, died at his home here Wednesday.</narrative>
  <narrative>The cause of death was lung cancer, diagnosed in mid-November, his wife, Joan, said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Waks, 66, who once described himself to a reporter as an "ornery cuss" but told voters they could count on him to be fair-minded, even-handed and flexible, was known for his honesty, compassion, intelligence and hard work.</narrative>
  <narrative>"He was one of Passaic County's real jewels," said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-Paterson), a close friend for whom Waks' son, Joseph, previously worked as spokesman.</narrative>
  <narrative>Born and raised in Paterson, Waks moved to Wayne and got his start in politics in 1971 as an advocate for local tenants after his landlord hiked his apartment's rent by 20 percent.</narrative>
  <narrative>He was elected to the council with heavy support from 5th Ward renters, and continued to support enforcement of tenants' rights. Often the only Democrat on a Republican governing body, Waks was elected mayor in 1994 and again in 1997, resigning to become judge in 2000.</narrative>
  <narrative>In December 1971, Wayne's township council voted to give one of its last liquor licenses to the friend of a councilman. Soon after he was sworn in, in January 1972, Waks drafted a resolution to rescind the issuance of the license. To avoid public allegations of cronyism, the councilman's friend returned the license before the resolution could go before the council, and the license was later issued to a Vietnam veteran who opened a now-defunct liquor store on Route 23.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It was a nice way to get started," said Waks. "Everybody knew the first time it was political patronage. It was the first thing I ever did, and still one of the proudest."</narrative>
  <narrative>Waks' tenure coincided with an era in which former Wayne officials, including its  former mayor, business administrator, and township attorney, pleaded guilty to taking part in various bribery schemes involving developers. Later, Waks and his wife, an attorney who served on the Wayne council after her husband's departure, sued the wrongdoers for damages in an innovative racketeering lawsuit that brought the township more than $300,000.</narrative>
  <narrative>Running for mayor, Waks refused to take campaign contributions from those doing business with the township.</narrative>
  <narrative>"He drove me nuts in this office," Beverly Tierney, administrative assistant in the Wayne mayor's office, said of her friend and former boss. "He never let anyone do anything. He would not accept a gift. A restaurant sent over a tray of cookies, and he had me send them back."</narrative>
  <narrative>He was sworn in as a Civil Division judge in state Superior Court in Paterson seven years ago today, according to Assignment Judge Robert Passero.</narrative>
  <narrative>Waks wasn't above getting personally involved in his job, according to Passero. He recalled a case before Waks in which a single mother with children faced eviction for failure to pay rent. "He gave her the money to pay the rent," Passero said. "While liking inwardly what he did, I actually had to admonish him for that as not being appropriate."</narrative>
  <narrative>For as hard as he worked and as compassionate as he was, Passero said Waks never let the grandiosity of being a judge go to his head. "He was the type of guy who never wore socks. I think he still wore the same ties as he had in high school," he said, with a laugh. "He was very unassuming. Very casual."</narrative>
  <narrative>Passero added, "He studied hard, he worked hard. In my opinion, he was an ideal judge."</narrative>
  <narrative>Waks graduated School 20 and Eastside High School in Paterson, and received a bachelor's degree from Rutgers University. In 1966, he earned a law degree from Georgetown University, where he met his wife. He joined his father, Isadore Waks, in his Paterson law practice the following year. On occasion Waks filled in for his father as attorney for Paterson's Board of Adjustment, and gave the money he earned for that work to his mother, Joan Waks said. Later, Waks continued as a solo practitioner.</narrative>
  <narrative>State Sen. John Girgenti, D-Hawthorne, who appointed Waks to state Superior Court, said Waks was "a perfect candidate for the bench, because he got along well with everyone."</narrative>
  <narrative>Waks received a lifetime appointment to the bench before the state Senate Judiciary Committee in May, Joan Waks said. Family members brought a wheelchair because he was weak at that point, but Waks stood for a brief speech about how "important it was to serve the people," said his wife.</narrative>
  <narrative>"He really was so proud to be recognized for the work he did," she said. "He loved being a judge."</narrative>
  <narrative>Waks quit smoking about 15 years ago, his wife said. She said he expressed his fear about dying and said he was "not ready to go." "I don't think he believed it 'til the end," she said. "He died like he lived, stubbornly."</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition to his wife, Waks is survived by a brother, Jay Waks, of Larchmont, N.Y.; his children, Joseph Waks and his wife Nancy Slowe of Bayonne; daughters Jennifer Kennelly and her husband Thomas, of Pompton Plains; and Melanie Graceffo and her husband Gerald, of Cranford, six grandchildren: Cole, McKenzie, and Aidan Kennelly, and Gordon, Gabriel, and Isabel Graceffo, and what his wife termed "his two granddogs."</narrative>
  <narrative>Joan Waks said she would hold a "family-only" service Monday. Waks, who was proud to be Jewish but nonpracticing, will be cremated, she said. A memorial service will likely be held Aug. 4 at DePaul High School in Wayne, where Waks sold coffee at Friday bingo games long past the time their children attended the school. Wayne Mayor Scott Rumana ordered flags to fly at half staff for 30 days to honor Waks.</narrative>
