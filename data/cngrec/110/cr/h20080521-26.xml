    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pioneer Middle School located in Yorkshire, New York. Last month, Pioneer Middle School was recognized as one of two Essential Elementary Schools to Watch in New York State. Pioneer is the first middle school in western New York to achieve this prestigious honor. Presently, only 10 middle schools in all of New York State have achieved this recognition over the past 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This award exemplifies the talent and dedication that these educators and parents demonstrate every day. The school has shown tremendous progress since being named a School in Need of Improvement by the Department of Education in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As these teachers, students, and parents gather to celebrate this wonderful accomplishment, I want to offer my sincere congratulations. Let the Pioneer Middle School serve as a beacon for schools around the Nation to see that excellence and success comes from devoted teachers and parents.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
