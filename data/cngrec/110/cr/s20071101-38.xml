    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am so pleased to congratulate Congregation B'nai Abraham in Beloit, WI, on their 100th anniversary. Congregation B'nai Abraham was established on November 7, 1907, and during the past 100 years it has thrived due to its outstanding leadership, a wonderful congregation, and a supportive community. I have many happy memories of my visits to this synagogue, particularly with the Beloit/Janesville BBYO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generations of Wisconsinites have proudly called Congregation B'nai Abraham their synagogue. Under the leadership of Rabbi Ira Youdovin, new generations will continue to flourish. Today we celebrate this outstanding achievement and the people over the last 100 years who have built this wonderful congregation. Mazel Tov on this remarkable anniversary, and I wish Congregation B'nai Abraham the best for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
