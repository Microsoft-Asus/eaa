  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer, to commend and congratulate the Anaheim Ducks for winning the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ducks are champions of the National Hockey League for the first time in their 14-year history. After defeating the Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Ducks won a hard-fought battle with the Detroit Red Wings to reach the Stanley Cup finals for the second time in franchise history. The Ducks reached the pinnacle of the hockey world by displaying the qualities of selflessness, teamwork, and resilience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This championship team was ably led by head coach Randy Carlyle and star players Teemu Selanne, Jean-Sebastian Giguere, Scott and Rob Niedermayer, and Chris Pronger. This talented crew battled their opponents throughout a 2-month marathon playoff and proudly wear the title of "champions."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ducks' championship represents the first time that the storied Stanley Cup has been able to call my State, California, its home. We Californians are proud to host this trophy, and we look forward to having it return many more times to our state in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ducks have begun a new era of hockey in Southern California and I am sure they will attempt to defend their title with the same heart, sacrifice and passion that brought the Stanley Cup to Anaheim this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ducks have proven that hockey is alive and well in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also look forward to seeing the other hockey franchises in California, the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks, compete with the Anaheim Ducks for hockey's greatest prize in the coming years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Anaheim Ducks players, coaches, management, and owners have made their community and their fans proud. The entire organization is to be commended and congratulated for their magnificent achievement.</paragraph>
