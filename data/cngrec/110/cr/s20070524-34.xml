    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my pleasure to present to the Senate report No. 110-71, titled "Economic Developments in Aging," as compiled by the Senate Special Committee on Aging for the 109th Congress. The Special Committee on Aging is required to report to the Senate at least once a Congress on findings from the work done by the committee. This report contains valuable insight uncovered by the committee over the past 10 years on the subject of the economics of retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Aging Committee has a long and distinguished history of investigating and debating issues of importance to America's aging population. Along with robust deliberations on retirement security, the committee also has initiated discussions on ways to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, and to expose companies that prey upon seniors using fraudulent marketing scams. I was proud to serve as chairman of this committee in the 109th Congress, when we began the process of compiling this report, and am  pleased to continue my service as ranking member of the committee in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Aging Committee is tasked with a significant challenge to ensure that we, as a nation, are prepared for the significant demographic shift with the aging of our population. In a few short years, a vast wave of Americans will begin to retire. In fact, between 2010 and 2030, the number of people age 65 and older is projected to increase by 76 percent. This change will impact a wide range of social and economic issues, such as labor shortages, loss of experienced workers many of whom have skills  that simply are not replaceable--and put a significant strain on the senior entitlement programs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To keep pace with the growing aging population, it is critical that Congress address these issues in a thoughtful manner that preserves benefits for those in need. The report compiles relevant high-level summaries of committee hearings related to retirement security that demonstrate the ongoing debate within Congress regarding the best approach to address these important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing a healthy debate on ways to best prepare for the challenges that await us with our aging nation. I hope this report provides valuable insight as we continue these discussions throughout this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all the members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging from the past 10 years for their participation in these vital discussions. I especially want to thank the committee's current chairman, Senator Herb Kohl, as well as the committee's past chairmen for their dedication to ensuring a positive future for America's seniors.</paragraph>
