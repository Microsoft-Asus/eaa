    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there's an easy civics pop quiz for the summer break. How many branches of government are there in the United States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, any high school civics student can tell you that there are three. But it seems like our Vice President is confused about the facts. House investigators have revealed that since 2003, the Vice President's office has failed to provide data on its classification activities as required under an executive order claiming that the Vice President's office is not, "an entity within the executive branch."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems that the Vice President's office believes that his office is its own branch of government above the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in light of this confusion, perhaps the President will see fit to give the Vice President some time off to improve his understanding of civics in the United States.</paragraph>
