  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to defend the majority leader's decision to go to cloture on the farm bill last night under the consent agreement we had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He consulted with me, and I share his view that we could have been on that bill into January at the rate we were going. It was time to bring it to conclusion. So I applaud the majority leader for his decision. I think it was the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we do have a chance to get additional progress this morning with the FHA matter. There is also the Defense authorization bill. I think we are making good progress this week, and the majority leader will have some excellent cooperation on this side of the aisle in that direction.</paragraph>
