  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="Introducing S. 439. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit certain retired members of the uniformed services who have a service-connected disability to receive both disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired pay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related Special Compensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="439">S. 439</bill>] Mr. President, we are going to have a debate on Iraq, and it will be a historic debate about that war, a war that has demanded unparalleled sacrifices from our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have our disagreements with the President's conduct of the war, all 100 Senators stand side by side in supporting our troops. They have done everything asked of them, carrying out a difficult mission with honor and skill. We as a country owe the brave men and women in our military a debt of gratitude and have responsibility to ensure our veterans receive both the thanks of a grateful nation and the benefits they have earned,  and that is a subject  I would like to discuss briefly this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 8 years ago, one of my staff came to me and said: Senator, do you realize that if a person is disabled in the military and retires from the military, they cannot draw on both their benefits? I said: What? And he repeated that. If you are in the military and you become disabled and you retire, you cannot draw both your benefits. I thought my staffer didn't know what he was talking about, but he did. That was the law in our country and had been for many years, and it was a wrong law. That  law is still mostly in effect, and that is too bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When someone who is disabled retires from the U.S. military, he or she cannot draw on both their benefits. If you retire from any other branch of the Federal Government, such as the Bureau of Land Management, you can draw both your disability pay and your retirement pay but, no, not if you are in the military. These people have been robbed of their benefits, in my opinion, and I refer specifically to thousands of men and women who have been denied their retirement because of an unfair policy  referred to as concurrent receipt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By law, disabled veterans, as I have said, cannot collect disability pay and retirement pay at the same time. What does this mean? It means for every dollar of compensation a disabled veteran receives as a result of their injuries, they must sacrifice a dollar of their retirement pay they earned in the service of our Nation. In many cases, this ban takes away a veteran's full retirement pay, wiping away the benefits he or she earned in 20 or more years of service. That is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Concurrent receipt is a special tax on the men and women who keep us safe. Few veterans can afford to live on their retirement pay alone. Those burdened with disability face an even greater struggle, often denied any postservice work. They receive disability compensation to pay for pain, suffering, and loss of future earnings caused by a service-connected illness or injury. No other Federal retiree is forced to make forfeit of their retirement--only our disabled military retirees. This is not  just an error, it is a disgrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, concurrent receipt is not a new problem. I hope most everyone in the Senate knows about it. This is the seventh year I have introduced legislation to give disabled veterans the support they have earned, and I will continue fighting until we succeed, ending this unacceptable policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first of all want to suggest that the two managers of the Defense bill, every year since I have worked on this, have been Senator Warner and Senator Levin, and they have helped me. I appreciate that very much. They have been thoughtful and understanding in their approach to this issue. What has happened these past 7 years is good but not really good. We have chipped away at this unfair policy of concurrent receipt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, I introduced legislation to eliminate this unfair policy for the first time. I did it at the end of the 106th Congress. This legislation passed the Senate but was removed by the House during conference. So I reintroduced the legislation in the 107th Congress, in both 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, it was once again adopted by the Senate but removed in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, I proposed legislation to allow disabled veterans with at least a 50-percent disability rating to become eligible for full concurrent receipt over a 10-year phase-in period. Despite veto threats from the Bush administration, Congress passed this very important version of concurrent receipt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, I took it a step further. I introduced legislation to eliminate the 10-year phase-in period for veterans with a 100-percent disability. The motivation here was to get concurrent receipt to the most severely disabled veterans. We thought many of these veterans would never see the benefits with a 10-year phase-in. They are old World War II veterans, where the average age is well over 80 now, and to think they would have to wait 10 years for a phase-in isn't very fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, we focused on the most severely disabled veterans and successfully eliminated the 10-year phase-in for veterans listed as unemployable. I was pleased with the passage of that 2005 amendment but disappointed that the conference committee chose not to enact this valuable legislation for veterans rated as unemployable until 2009. So in 2006, I sought to get unemployable veterans immediate relief, but we didn't act. Congress didn't act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are in 2007, back at it again. Today, concurrent receipt remains one of my highest priorities. It is a priority, I believe, in fairness. We need to continue to chip away at this policy, and I am committed to that goal 100 percent, so that 100 percent of disabled veterans get the money they earn in being part of the great fighting force of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are blessed in this country to be defended by an All-Volunteer Army. These patriots put their lives and safety on the line because they love this country. I believe it is time for this country and this Congress to repay their service and sacrifice, and that is why I am reintroducing today the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2007.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 442. A bill to provide for loan repayment for prosecutors and public defenders; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="442">S. 442</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007. I am honored to have the support and cosponsorship of Senator Leahy and Senator Specter, the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, on this important legislation. I look forward to working closely with Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member SPECTER to advance it through the Judiciary Committee and secure its enactment into law.  I also appreciate the cosponsorship of Senator Smith, Senator Kerry and Senator Collins on this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill seeks to enhance our criminal justice system by encouraging talented law school graduates to serve as criminal prosecutors and public defenders. The bill would establish a student loan repayment program for qualified attorneys who agree to remain employed for at least 3 years as State or local criminal prosecutors, or as State, local, or Federal public defenders in criminal cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by the American Bar Association, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our criminal justice system to function effectively, we need to have a sufficient supply of dedicated and competent attorneys working in prosecutor and public defender offices. However, many qualified law school graduates who have a strong motivation to work in the public sector find it economically impossible due to the overwhelming burden of student loan debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legal profession and our communities pay a severe price when law graduates are shut out from pursuing public service careers due to educational debt. When prosecutor and public defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or keep experienced ones, their ability to protect the public interest is compromised. Such offices may find themselves unable to take on new cases due to staffing shortages, and their existing staff may be forced to handle unmanageable workloads. Cases may suffer from lengthy  and unnecessary delays, and some cases may be mishandled by inexperienced or overworked attorneys. As a result, innocent people may be sent to jail, and criminals may go free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill, the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act, is designed to help remedy some of these problems. The availability of student loan repayment can be a powerful incentive for attracting talented new lawyers to public service employment. Our proposal complements loan forgiveness options that currently exist for Federal prosecutors. Passage of this bill will help make prosecutor and public defender jobs at all levels of government more attractive and financially viable for  law school graduates who have incurred significant educational debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill is named after the late John R. Justice, former president of the National District Attorneys Association and a distinguished prosecutor from the State of South Carolina. John Justice was instrumental in promoting student loan repayment efforts for law school graduates seeking to work in public service. This bill is a fitting tribute to his dedicated efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this legislation is evident. In recent years, the costs of a law school education have skyrocketed. Researchers found that tuition increased about 340 percent from 1985 to 2002 for private law school students and for out-of-State students at public law schools. In-State students at public law schools saw their tuition jump about 500 percent during that time. In 2005, the average annual tuition was $28,900 for private law schools, $22,987 for nonresident students at public law schools,  and $13,145 for resident students at public law schools. These tuition costs do not include the costs of food, lodging, books, fees and personal expenses over 3 years of law school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of law students--over 80 percent--must borrow funds to finance their legal education. According to the American Bar Association, the average total cumulative educational debt for law school graduates in the class of 2005 was $78,763 for private schools and $51,056 for public schools. Two-thirds of law students generally carry additional unpaid debt from their undergraduate studies. These education debts are serious financial obligations that must be repaid, as  any default on a loan triggers significant consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many law students graduate with a deep commitment to pursuing a career in public service. However, they need a level of income sufficient to meet the demands of their educational loan liabilities, and public service salaries have not kept up with rising law school debt burdens. From 1985 to 2002, while law school tuition increased 340 percent for private law school students and 500 percent for in-state students at public law schools, salaries for public service lawyers such as prosecutors and  public defenders increased by just 70 percent. According to the National Association for Law Placement, NALP, the median entry-level salary for public defenders is $43,000. With 11 to 15 years of experience, the median salary  increases only to $65,500. The salary progression for State prosecuting attorneys is similar, starting at around $46,000 and progressing to about $68,000 for those with 11 to 15 years of experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many law school graduates can earn much more and repay their student loans much faster by entering the private sector. According to a NALP survey, in 2005 the median salary for first-year attorneys at law firms ranged from $67,500 in firms of 2 to 25 attorneys to $135,000 in firms of 500 attorneys or more. The median first-year salary for all firms participating in the survey was $100,000. When choosing between a private sector job and a job as a prosecutor or defender, talented law graduates  with large debt burdens must take into consideration this salary differential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that large student debt deters many law graduates from pursuing public service careers. According to a national survey of 1,622 students from 117 law schools conducted by Equal Justice Works, the Partnership for Public Service, and NALP in 2002, 66 percent of respondents stated that law school debt prevented them from considering a public interest or government job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some law graduates initially accept public service jobs despite their high debt burdens. However, many attorneys cannot repay their loan obligations as well as pay all their other living expenses on a government salary. Attorneys who begin careers in public service, and who would like to remain, frequently leave after a few years when they find their debts are hindering their ability to provide for themselves, much less support their families or save for retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many public service employers report having a difficult time attracting and retaining talented law graduates. Prosecutor and public defender offices across the country have vacancies they cannot fill because new law graduates cannot afford to work for them. Alternatively, those who do hire law graduates find that, because of educational debt burdens, those whom they do hire leave just at the point when they have acquired the experience to provide the most valuable services. According to a Bureau  of Justice Statistics survey, 24 percent of state prosecutors' offices reported problems in 2005 with recruiting new attorneys, and 35 percent reported problems in retaining attorneys. Another survey administered by Equal Justice Works and the National Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association in 2002 found that over 60 percent of public interest law employers, including state and local prosecutor and public defender offices, reported difficulty in attorney recruitment and retention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently received a letter from Bernard Murray, President of the Prosecutors Bar Association and Chief of the Criminal Prosecutions Bureau for the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in Chicago. He wrote: "[W]e are faced with enormous hurdles in attracting first-rate candidates to pursue a career with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. We simply cannot afford to pay new assistants a salary high enough to offset the enormous debt load that follows them from their law school graduation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His letter also stated: "We are observing an exodus of talent at about the three to five year experience mark in the office when assistants are no longer able to postpone life events such as marriage, home ownership, and starting a family. We are losing much of our best talent before they even have a chance to put their skills to use in felony cases."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also received a copy of a letter from Michael Judge, Chief Defender of the Los Angeles County Public Defender Office, the oldest and largest such office in the Nation. His letter states the following about his office's efforts to recruit new lawyers: "It became necessary to expand the ambit of recruiting from locally to statewide, to the western region of the country and now to the entire nation to ensure the success of our recruiting in the face of the deterrent of crushing student loan debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It harms the public interest when communities face a shortage of attorneys who can effectively prosecute cases and provide criminal defendants with their constitutional right to counsel. Sadly, these situations occur all too frequently. We can--and should--do more to help prosecutor and public defender offices recruit and retain attorneys in the face of increasing student debt burdens and higher private sector salaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation would help by establishing, within the Department of Justice, a program of student loan repayment for borrowers who agree to remain employed for at least three years as State or local criminal prosecutors, or as State, local, or Federal public defenders in criminal cases. It would allow eligible attorneys to receive student loan debt repayments of up to $10,000 per year, with a maximum aggregate over time of $60,000. The bill would cover student loans made, insured, or guaranteed  under the Higher Education Act of 1965, including consolidation loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under our bill, repayment benefits for public sector attorneys would be made available on a first-come, first-served basis, and would be subject to the availability of appropriations. Priority would be given to borrowers who received repayment benefits for the preceding fiscal year and who have completed less than three years of the first required service period. Borrowers could enter into an additional agreement, after the required three-year period, for a successive period of service which  may be less than three years. Attorneys who do not complete their required period of service would be required to repay the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to covering those who agree to serve in State and local prosecutor and defender offices, our bill complements existing loan forgiveness programs that are currently available for Federal prosecutors by making loan relief available to Federal public defenders as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill is modeled on a loan repayment program that has been created for Federal executive branch employees and that has enjoyed growing success. Federal law currently permits Federal executive branch agencies to repay their employees' student loans, up to $10,000 in a year, and up to a lifetime maximum of $60,000. In exchange, the employee must agree to remain with the agency for at least three years. According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), during fiscal year 2005 there were  479 lawyers working in Federal agencies who received loan repayments under this program, including 242 lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission and 85 attorneys for the Department of Justice. According to OPM, Federal agencies across the board say that the program has been of tremendous benefit in recruiting and retaining attorneys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have worked on behalf of our legislation, I have been moved by the personal stories of attorneys who have been trying to embark on a career of public service but have been struggling because of student loans. One compelling letter I received came from Aisha Cornelius, an Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County, Illinois. Her letter said the following: "I am a full-time prosecutor in Cook County. I wanted this job because I desired to use my law degree for public service. Although making  a lot of money was not my primary goal, I had hoped at least for financial stability. This, however, is difficult to accomplish as my student loan payments take up a considerable amount of my income. I have more than $100,000 in student loan debt. I am also a single mother with a five-year-old daughter in kindergarten. In order to work, I have to pay for before- and after-school care for her. ..... I depleted my savings while studying for the bar exam last year and I essentially live check to check. In order to supplement my income, I sell</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Ms. Cornelius's willingness to share her story with me. By enacting and funding this legislation, we can take a meaningful step toward alleviating some of the financial burden for attorneys such as Ms. Cornelius who choose careers as criminal prosecutors and public defenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are many other law graduates who, like Aisha Cornelius, want to apply their legal training and develop their skills in the public sector, but are deterred by the weight of student loan obligations. Passage of the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act will help them make their career dreams a reality. I urge its swift adoption.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="Introducing S. 447. A bill to abolish the dealth penalty under Federal law; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="447">S. 447</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2007. This bill would abolish the death penalty at the Federal level. It would put an immediate halt to executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of Federal law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court, there have been 1,060 executions across the country, including three at the Federal level. During that same time period, 123 people on death row have been exonerated and released from death row. These people never should have been convicted in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider those numbers. One thousand and sixty executions, and one hundred and twenty-three exonerations in the modern death penalty era. Had those exonerations not taken place, had those 123 people been executed, those executions would have represented an error rate of greater than 10 percent. That is more than an embarrassing statistic; it is a horrifying one, one that should have us all questioning the use of capital punishment in this country. In fact, since 1999 when I first introduced this  bill, 46 death row inmates have been exonerated throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of these numbers, the national debate on the death penalty has intensified. For the second year in a row, the number of executions, the number of death sentences imposed, and the size of the death row population have decreased as a growing number of voices have joined to express doubt about the use of capital punishment in America. The voices of those questioning the fairness of the death penalty have been heard from college campuses and courtrooms and podiums across the Nation, to  the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, to the United States Supreme Court. The American public understands that the death penalty raises serious and complex issues. The death penalty can no longer be exploited for political purposes. In fact, for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in 1976 to allow capital punishment, the Federal Government first resumed death penalty prosecutions after enactment of a 1988 Federal law that provided for the death penalty for murder in the course of a drug-kingpin conspiracy. The Federal death penalty was then expanded significantly in 1994, when the omnibus crime bill expanded its use to a total of some 60 Federal offenses. And despite my best efforts to halt the expansion of the Federal death  penalty, more and more provisions seem to be added every year. While the use of and confidence in the death penalty is decreasing overall, the Federal Government has been going in the opposite direction, making more defendants eligible for capital punishment and increasing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this very day eight years ago, Governor George Ryan took the historic step of placing a moratorium on executions in Illinois and creating an independent, blue ribbon commission to review the State's death penalty system. The Commission conducted an extensive study of the death penalty in Illinois and released a report with 85 recommendations for reform of the death penalty system. The Commission concluded that the death penalty system is not fair, and that the risk of executing the innocent  is alarmingly real. Governor Ryan later pardoned four death row inmates and commuted the sentences of all remaining Illinois death row inmates to life in prison before he left office in January 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois is not alone. Seven years ago, then Maryland Governor Parris Glendening learned of suspected racial disparities in the administration of the death penalty in Maryland. Governor Glendening did not look the other way. He commissioned the University of Maryland to conduct the most exhaustive study of Maryland's application of the death penalty in history. Then faced with the rapid approach of a scheduled execution, Governor Glendening acknowledged that it was unacceptable to allow executions  to take place while the study he had ordered was not yet complete. So, in May 2002, he placed a moratorium on executions. Although Governor Bob Ehrlich lifted that moratorium and allowed executions to resume during his tenure, Governor Martin O'Malley has indicated that he would approve a legislative repeal of the death penalty and that he, like the majority in this country, favors life without parole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other States also have taken important steps. New York's death penalty was overturned by a court decision in 2004 and has not been reinstated by the legislature, and New Jersey enacted a moratorium in 2006. Along with New York and New Jersey, four other States that still have the death penalty technically on their books have not executed any individuals since 1976. In addition, there are 12 States, plus the District of Columbia, whose laws do not provide for capital punishment at all. And following  in the footsteps of Illinois and Maryland, North Carolina and California both began legislative studies of their own capital punishment systems this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The more we learn about the death penalty through studies like those, the more reasons we have to oppose it. For example, the Maryland study--released in January 2003--contained findings that should startle us all. The study found that blacks accused of killing whites are more likely to receive a death sentence than blacks who kill blacks, or than white killers. According to the report, black offenders who kill whites are four times as likely to be sentenced to death as blacks who kill blacks,  and twice as likely to get a death sentence as whites who kill whites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Maryland and Illinois studies cannot be brushed aside as atypical or dismissed as revealing state-specific anomalies in an otherwise perfect system. Years of study have shown that the death penalty does little to deter crime, and that defendants' likelihood of being sentenced to death depends heavily on illegitimate factors such as whether they are rich or poor. Since reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 80 percent of murder victims in cases where death sentences were handed down were  white, even though only 50 percent of murder victims are white. Nationwide, more than half of the death row inmates are African Americans or Hispanic Americans. There is evidence of racial disparities, inadequate counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and false scientific evidence in death penalty systems across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least Maryland, Illinois, North Carolina, and California have begun the process of investigating the flaws in their own systems. But there are 36 other States that have death penalty provisions in their laws, 36 other States with systems that are most likely plagued with the same flaws. And these systems come at great additional cost to the taxpayers. For example, a 2005 report found that California's death penalty system costs taxpayers $114 million in additional costs each year. Similar  reports detailing the extraordinary financial costs of the death penalty have been generated for States across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, there are growing concerns about the most common method of execution, lethal injection. These concerns are so grave that eight States and the Federal system all halted individual executions in 2006 to work through these problems. And these numbers are growing. Just this last week, executions in North Carolina were halted because of challenges to lethal injection. More and more research is emerging that suggests that lethal injections are unnecessarily painful and cruel, and that this  method of capital punishment--however sanitary or humane it may appear--is no less barbaric than the more antiquated methods lethal injection was designed to replace, such as the noose or the firing squad, no less horrific than the electric chair or the gas chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing is more barbaric, of course, than the execution of an innocent person, and it is clearer than ever that the  risk is very real. Already, information has surfaced that suggests that two men put to death in the 1990s may have been innocent. This is a chilling prospect, one that illustrates the very grave danger in imposing the death penalty. The loss of just one innocent life through capital punishment should be enough to force all of us to stop  and reconsider this penalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while we examine the flaws in our death penalty system, we cannot help but note that our use of the death penalty stands in stark contrast to the majority of nations, which have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. There are now 123 countries that have done so. In 2005, only China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia executed more people than we did. These countries, and others on the list of nations that actively use capital punishment, are countries that we often criticize for human rights  abuses. The European Union denies membership in the alliance to those nations that use the death penalty. In fact, it passed a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional global abolition of the death penalty, and it specifically called on all States within the United States</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are a Nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a Nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. Historically, we are one of the first Nations to speak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. We should hold our own system of justice to the highest standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of justice, this is an issue that transcends political allegiances. A range of prominent voices in our country are raising serious questions about the death penalty, and they are not just voices of liberals, or of the faith community. They are the voices of former FBI Director William Sessions, former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Reverend Pat Robertson, George Will, former Mississippi warden Donald Cabana, the Republican former Governor of Illinois, George Ryan, and the Democratic  former Governor of Maryland, Parris Glendening. The voices of those questioning our application of the death penalty are growing in number, they are growing louder, and they are reflected in some of the decisions of the highest court of the land. In recent years, the Supreme Court has held that the execution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded is unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we begin a new year and a new Congress, I believe the continued use of the death penalty in the United States is beneath us. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is immoral. The adage "two wrongs do not make a right," applies here in the most fundamental way. Our Nation has long ago done away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of criminals. Just we did away with these punishments as contrary to our humanity and ideals,  it is time to abolish the death penalty as we seek to spread peace and justice both here and overseas. It is not just a matter of morality. The continued viability of our criminal justice system as a truly just system that deserves the respect of our own people and the world requires that we do so. Our Nation's goal to remain the world's leading defender of freedom, liberty and equality demands that we do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take patience, persistence, and courage. As we work to move forward in a rapidly changing world, let us leave this archaic practice behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing the death penalty in our great Nation. I also call on each State that authorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us together reject violence and restore fairness and integrity to our criminal justice system.</paragraph>

Our Nation's law enforcement officers put themselves in harms way on a daily basis to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens and the domestic security of our Nation. Nevertheless, many  times these brave officers do not receive basic rights if they become involved in internal police investigations or administrative hearings. According to the National Association of Police Organizations, "[i]n roughly half of the states in this country, officers enjoy some legal protections against false accusations and abusive conduct, but hundreds of thousands of officers have very limited due  process rights and confront limitations on their exercise of other rights, such as the right to engage in political</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation being introduced today, which is endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and of the National Association of Police Organizations, seeks to provide officers with certain basic protections in those jurisdictions where such workplace protections are not currently provided. First, this bill allows law enforcement officials to engage in political activities when they are off-duty. Second, it provides standards and procedures to guide State and local law enforcement agencies during  internal investigations, interrogations, and administrative disciplinary hearings. Additionally, it calls upon States to develop and enforce these disciplinary procedures. The bill would preempt State laws which confer fewer rights than those provided for in the legislation, but it would not preempt</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will also include important provisions that will enhance the ability of citizens to hold their local police departments accountable. The legislation includes provisions that will ensure citizen complaints against police officers are investigated and that citizens are informed of the outcome of these investigations. The bill balances the rights of police officers with the rights of citizens to raise valid concerns about the conduct of some of these officers. In addition, I have consulted  with constitutional experts who have opined that the bill is consistent with Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause and that it does not run afoul of the Supreme Court's Tenth Amendment jurisprudence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to note that I understand the objections that many management groups, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police's, have to this measure. I have discussed this with them, and I've pledged that their views will be heard and considered as this bill is debated in Congress. It is my view that we must bridge this gap. Without a meeting of the minds between police management and union officials, the enactment of a meaningful law enforcement officers' bill of rights  will be difficult. Law enforcement officials are facing unprecedented challenges, and management and labor simply must work together on this issue and the numerous other issues facing the law enforcement community.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="Introducing S. 451. A bill to establish a National Foreign language Coordination Council; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="451">S. 451</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the National Foreign Language Coordination Act with my colleagues Senators Thad Cochran, Christopher Dodd, and Russell Feingold. We are joined by  Representative Brian Baird, who is offering a companion bill in the House of Representatives today as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we introduce today would implement a key recommendation of the 2004 Department of Defense, DOD, National Language Conference to establish a National Foreign Language Coordination Council, chaired by a National Language Director. An integrated foreign language strategy and sustained leadership within the Federal Government is needed to address the lack of foreign language proficient speakers in government and in business. Without such a coordinated strategy, I fear that the country's  national and economic security will be at greater risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The communications failures of 9/11 clearly demonstrate that we can no longer ignore the consequence of our citizens being unable to converse fluently in languages other than English. The fact that only 9.3 percent of all Americans speak both their native languages and another language fluently, compared with 56 percent of people in the European Union is troubling. The Iraq Study Group reported last month that of the 1,000 American embassy employees in Baghdad, only 33 speak Arabic, and just  6 of them are fluent in this critical language. The shortfall of skilled linguists prompted the Iraq Study Group to recommend that "The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence should accord the highest possible priority to professional language proficiency and cultural training, in general and specifically for U.S. officers and personnel about to be assigned to Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has an essential role to play by collaborating with educators, State and local governments, foreign language associations, and the private sector to increase the number of Americans who speak and understand foreign languages. A National Foreign Language Coordination Council brings these diverse interests together to shape a much needed, comprehensive approach. Just as I have advocated the need for deputy secretaries for management at the Departments of Defense and Homeland  Security to direct and sustain management leadership, I envision a National Language Director to be responsible for maintaining and leading a cooperative effort to strengthen our foreign language capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's security is at risk without a sufficient number of foreign language proficient individuals. Counterterrorism intelligence will go untranslated and opportunities will be missed. Equally important is preserving the economic competitiveness of the United States. Globalization means that Americans must compete for jobs in a marketplace no longer confined to the boundaries of the United States. In short, both the security and economic vitality of the United States are tied to improving  foreign language education. However, according to the Committee on Economic Development, many of our schools do not have foreign language</paragraph>
    <paragraph>programs that address the educational challenges of the 21st century. Many American students lack sufficient knowledge of other countries, languages, and cultures to compete effectively in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, our bill ensures that the key recommendations of the DOD National Language Conference will be implemented by: Developing policies and programs that build the Nation's language and cultural understanding capability; engaging Federal, State, and local agencies and the private sector in solutions; developing language and cultural competency across public and private sectors; developing language skills in a wide range of critical languages; strengthening our education system, programs,  and tools in foreign languages and cultures; and integrating language training into career fields and increase the number of language professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, which I chair, held a hearing on the Federal Government's language strategy. Dr. Diane Birckbich1er, director of the Foreign Language Center and chair of the Departments of French and Italian at Ohio State University, testified that "if there is a national language strategy, it isn't very well known." She further recommended the development of a national language policy to  create a language-ready workforce for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To strengthen the role of the United States in the world, our country must ensure that there is a sufficient number of individuals who are proficient in languages other than their native languages. Increasing foreign language skills enhances national security, just as increasing foreign language skills enhances the ability of Americans to compete on a more global playing field.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="Introducing S. 453. A bill to prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="453">S. 453</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today that seeks to address the all-too-common efforts to deceive voters in order to keep them away from the polls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's hard to imagine that we even need a bill like this. But, unfortunately, there are people who will stop at nothing to try to deceive voters and keep them away from the polls. What's worse, these practices often target and exploit vulnerable populations, such as minorities, the disabled, or the poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw countless examples in this past election. Some of us remember the thousands of Latino voters in Orange County, California, who received letters warning them in Spanish that, "if you are an immigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that can result in incarceration."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or the voters in Maryland who received a "democratic sample ballot" featuring a Republican candidate for Governor and a Republican candidate for U.S. Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or the voters in Virginia who received calls from a so-called "Virginia Elections Commission" informing them--falsely--that they were ineligible to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or the voters who were told that they couldn't vote if they had family members who had been convicted of a crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, these so-called warnings have no basis in fact, and are made with only one goal in mind--to keep Americans away from the polls. We see these problems year after year and election and after election, and my hope is that this bill will finally stop these practices in time for the next election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am reintroducing the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act. It's a bill that makes voter intimidation and deception punishable by law, and it contains strong penalties so that people who commit these crimes suffer more than just a slap on the wrist. The bill also seeks to address the real harm of these crimes--people who are prevented from voting by misinformation--by establishing a process for reaching out to these misinformed voters with accurate information  so they can cast their votes in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Schumer has joined me in introducing this legislation, and we are joined by our colleagues, Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senators Cardin, Feingold, Kerry, Feinstein and Clinton as original co-sponsors to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some issues in this country that are inherently difficult and political. Making sure that every American can cast a ballot shouldn't be one of them. There is no place for politics in this debate--no room for those who feel that they can gain a partisan advantage by keeping people away from the polls. It's time to get this done in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe this bill can make it happen.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="Introducing S. 453. A bill to prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Obama in introducing landmark legislation to protect the most sacred right of our democracy: the right to vote. The Obama-Schumer Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 will end the deceptive practices that have become far too common in recent elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the outset, I want to commend my colleague from Illinois, Senator Obama, for his leadership on this important issue. It has been a great pleasure to work with him to draft this bill. I am also proud that we are joined by Senators Leahy, Cardin, Feingold, Kerry, Feinstein, and Clinton as original cosponsors of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that there is an urgent need for this legislation. The right to vote is the wellspring of our democracy. Yet Americans have been profoundly shocked and disgusted in recent elections to see so many cynical attempts to lie to voters in order to keep them from casting their ballots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give just a few examples. In last year's mid-term election, letters in Spanish were sent to voters in Orange County, CA, stating that it is a crime for an immigrant to vote. In fact, immigrants who are naturalized citizens have the right to vote just as any other American citizen does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, as well, fliers were handed out on election day in Maryland that gave the impression that top Republican candidates for office were Democratic candidates and were endorsed by prominent African Americans. These fliers were a clear and deliberate attempt to mislead voters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Virginia, registered voters received recorded calls that falsely stated that the recipient of the call was registered in another State and would face criminal charges if they came to the polls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These dirty tricks are not new. In 2002, fliers were distributed in public housing complexes in Louisiana, telling people that they could cast their votes 3 days after election day if the weather was bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These schemes insult the intelligence of those they target, and they insult our democracy. Yet they actually seem to be growing more common. The shameful reality is that today, Federal law does not prohibit wrongdoers from spreading these lies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is high time for Congress to do something about this disgraceful state of affairs. The Obama-Schumer bill creates a new offense of voter deception. Under our legislation, anyone who intentionally lies to voters about certain key information will now face both civil penalties and criminal punishment of up to 5 years in prison or a $100,000 fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Obama-Schumer bill covers the facts that are most critical for reaching the polls--facts like where, when,  and how you can vote; whether you are eligible to vote; or whether an organization has actually endorsed a candidate. When voters are being misled about these core facts, the right to vote is nothing more than a hollow promise. It is a real threat to the right to vote when criminal elements are deliberately lying about something as basic--yet  as important--as the date of the election. These types of lies are the poll taxes of today. They are being used to build a barrier around polling places and to disenfranchise voters in the most cynical and destructive way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even when misinformation campaigns are not successful, because voters are too smart and too determined to reach the polls, these deceptive practices make a mockery out of the great tradition of American democracy. These despicable attempts have gone unpunished for far too long. The Obama-Schumer bill provides strong penalties to deter and punish the offense of voter deception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Obama-Schumer bill will also increase the maximum penalty for voter intimidation from 1 year to 5 years in prison. Someone who tries to keep voters away from the polls with threats should not be released with a slap on the wrist, and our bill will create real penalties for this crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our legislation also ensures that lies do not go unanswered and pass for truth. Under the Obama-Schumer bill, the Department of Justice will be responsible for getting the correct information out to voters so that they can get to the polls and cast their vote without undue confusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a check on whether elections are being tainted by these practices, after each election, the Attorney General will have to report to Congress about allegations of voter deception and how they were handled. We want to make sure that the Department of Justice uses the new tools that would be provided under this bill. The Attorney General's reports will give us a foundation for vigorous oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also be clear about what this legislation does not do. Senator Obama and I have taken great care to craft a bill that will not run afoul of the first amendment or prevent Americans from expressing their political opinions. Our bill strikes a balance between the need for political debate and the fundamental right to vote. It is narrowly tailored: it applies only to activities within 60 days prior to an election, and it covers only the key facts that voters need to reach the polls  and cast their votes without interference. This bill will not limit legitimate debate, and it will not punish honest mistakes. It is clear from the dirty tricks that America has witnessed in recent elections that the Congress has a compelling interest in protecting the right to vote by regulating false speech that disenfranchises voters. We have a responsibility to act on that interest for the sake of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Obama-Schumer Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 will finally criminalize efforts to keep voters away from the polls with deliberate lies. I hope and trust that the Congress will take up our bill and pass it without delay.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="Introducing S. 453. A bill to prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I join Senators OBAMA, SCHUMER, CARDIN, FEINSTEIN, FEINGOLD, CLINTON, and KERRY to introduce the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007, a measure that would create new protections and expand existing protections against the use of deceptive practices in elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few things as critical to the fabric of our Nation, and to American citizenship, as voting. The right to vote and to have your vote count is a foundational right, like our first amendment rights, because it secures the effectiveness of other protections. The legitimacy of our government is dependent on the access all Americans have to the political process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw last year in nearly 20 hearings in the House and Senate on the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act that there is a continuing need for the vital voting rights protections that landmark civil rights law provides for all Americans. But our need to protect the effective access of voters to the political process does not stop with those vital protections against discrimination. I am concerned about increasing efforts on behalf of some candidates and political parties to interfere with  recent elections and undermine the participation of many voters. So today we take another step toward protecting the exercise of the effective exercise of voting rights by ensuring that the access to vote is not undermined by those who would take away that access through deceit and false information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 would provide additional tools and criminal penalties to help combat the kinds of practices used during the 2006 midterms in places like Maryland and Virginia. In Maryland, Republican leaders admitted to distributing misleading flyers in African-American communities on election day suggesting that prominent African-American Democrats supported Republican candidates. In Virginia, the FBI has investigated calls received by many  voters in heavily Democratic precincts directing them to the wrong polling sites, giving incorrect information about their eligibility to vote, or encouraging them not to vote on election day. I supported a similar bill, <bill type="s" number="1975">S. 1975</bill>, in the last Congress, and I hope that we can move forward in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the problems leading up to and on election day last year were not limited to a few isolated incidents. In the ninth precinct in Tucson, AZ, an area with a heavy percentage of Latino voters, it has been reported that three vigilantes armed with a clipboard, a video camera, and a visible firearm stopped only Latino voters as they entered and exited the polls on election day, issuing implied and overt threats. In Orange County, CA, Republican congressional candidate Tan Nguyen admitted  that his campaign staffer sent letters to 73,000 households, spreading misinformation about voting requirements apparently designed to suppress Latino voter turnout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In letters to the Attorney General and other officials at the Justice Department and in oversight hearings last November and 2 weeks ago, we have asked the Justice Department for more information about what it has been doing to investigate and combat these practices. In the information we have obtained so far, it is apparent that the Justice Department has not done enough and additional tools are needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007 would expand the conduct currently prohibited by law to include the dissemination of false information within 60 days of an election about the time, place, and manner of the election, the qualifications for voter eligibility, or the sponsor of public communications about an election. In addition, it would provide new means of enforcing these prohibitions and combating such dissemination: it creates a private right of action  for persons aggrieved by the dissemination of such false information; it provides criminal penalties for such false dissemination of up to 5 years and $100,000; and it provides that any person may report such false dissemination to the Attorney General, and if it is determined that such information is false or deliberately</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill and enacting it into law, we can continue our march towards a more inclusive democracy for all Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="Introducing S. 453. A bill to prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Obama and our other colleagues in sponsoring the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act, because it addresses an essential aspect of voting rights. For too long, we've ignored the festering problem of deceptive practices intended to intimidate and deceive voters in our national elections and suppress the vote of certain minority groups for partisan gain. The problem is a continuing threat to our democracy,  and it's up to our new Congress to outlaw such practices, and I commend the Senator from Illinois for his leadership on this basic challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing so, we must be vigilant to ensure that the bill does not erode the important division of responsibility in the Department of Justice between civil rights enforcement by the Civil Rights Division and the efforts by the Criminal Division to combat voter fraud. That division of responsibility is essential to convincing voters, particularly those in poor or minority communities to have the trust necessary to work with the Civil Rights Division and to inform it of possible civil rights violations.  The bill should clearly provide that, as traditionally has been the case, the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division may not investigate matters of voter fraud, although it  may provide technical advice and assistance to other parts of the Department in carrying out the requirements of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to guarantee that additional resources are appropriated to carry out the bill's requirements, so that resources will not be diverted from other important law enforcement activities of the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we must ensure that the bill's civil and criminal provisions are not misused to erode voter participation even further, particularly among poor and minority voters by wrongly targeting voter registration activities or chilling legitimate get-out-the-vote efforts by organizations serving the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward very much to working with my colleagues to deal with these specific issues, and to enact this important new measure as part of our fundamental responsibility to protect the most basic right in our democracy, the right to vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="Introducing S. 454. A bill to provide an increase in funding for Federal Pell Grants, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in order to expand the deduction for interest paid on student loans, raise the contribution limits for Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, and make the exclusion for employer provided educational assistance permanent, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="454">S. 454</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Improving Access to Higher Education Act. This legislation would provide an increase in the maximum Pell grant award to $5,100, as well as additional benefits to help make higher education more accessible and affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our system of higher education is, in many ways, the envy of the world, but its benefits have not been equally available. Unfortunately, family income still largely determines whether students will pursue higher education. Students from families with incomes above $75,000 are more than twice as likely to attend college as students from families with incomes of less than $25,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help remedy these inequities, the Federal Government has committed itself to a need-based system of student financial aid designed to help remove the economic barriers to higher education. Central to this effort over the past 30 years has been the Pell grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pell Grant Program is the largest source of Federal grant aid and the cornerstone of our Federal need-based aid system. In 2006, the Pell program provided approximately $13 billion in grant aid to more than 5.3 million students. Students with the greatest need receive the maximum Pell award, which is currently set at $4,050. And Pell grants are truly targeted to the neediest of students--Pell recipients have a median family income of only $15,200.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the central role of the Pell Grant Program, I am deeply concerned by the significant erosion in the purchasing power of the Pell grant that has occurred in recent years. In 1975, the maximum Pell grant represented approximately 80 percent of the costs of attending a public, 4-year institution. Today, it covers only 33 percent of these costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When lower levels of grant aid are available, students are forced to make up the difference by taking on larger and larger amounts of debt to finance their education. Earlier this month, I met with two students from the University of Southern Maine who told me that students graduating from 4-year institutions in Maine leave with an average debt of $20,239. As startling as this figure may be, it underestimates the true indebtedness of students, since it does not take into account credit card debt  or private loans that students use to help finance their education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decline in the value of grant aid and the growing reliance on loans have particularly negative consequences for low-income students. In fact, the staggering amount of debt required to finance higher education may force some low-income students to abandon their plans to attend college altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As explained in a recent report by the Educational Policy Institute, "Grants for Students: What they do, Why they work," people from lower-income backgrounds often place a higher value on having money to meet pressing current needs, and accordingly, are less likely to make investments where the financial return comes only in the long term. According to the report, "[L]ong term poverty encourages short-term thinking and those who experience it tend to identify very strongly with the expression</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today I am introducing legislation that will raise the maximum Pell grant award to $5,100, an increase of more tha</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$1,000 in a single year. While I recognize that this represents a significant increase in a single year, this increase is long overdue. The maximum grant award has been essentially level-funded since Fiscal Year 2002. If we do not act soon Fiscal Year 2007 will become the fifth year in a row that the Pell maximum award has been level-funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By raising the maximum award to $5,100, my home state of Maine will receive approximately $60 million in Pell grant funding, an increase of over $15 million from current levels. This level of funding would provide Pell grants to more than 20,000 Maine students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently met with Andrew Bossie, a first-generation college student from my hometown of Caribou, about the importance of Pell grants. Andrew is currently a student at the University of Southern Maine and will graduate this spring, in large part, because of the help of Pell grants. As Andrew told me, "Without Pell grants, there is no doubt that I would not have been able to attend college. Although the current Pell grant award is a huge help, I still feel the stress of sometimes having to decide  between a badly-needed new pair of shoes and making my tuition payments." Andrew is thriving academically--he is on the Dean's list--and he is also the student body president and is active as a community volunteer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing the maximum Pell award by $1,050 is going to make a real difference for Andrew and other students in their ability to pursue their college dreams. While I recognize that an increase to $5,100 in a single year is an ambitious goal, it is a worthy one for a nation that understands the opportunities that a college education brings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation also amends the Higher Education Act to raise the minimum Pell award to $500, up from the current minimum of $400. The minimum award level has not been increased in over 10 years. I believe we should ensure that every student who qualifies for a Pell receives at least $500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to our efforts on behalf of Pell grants, there are other important steps we can take to put higher education in the reach of more families. Ten years ago, in my first year as a Senator, I introduced <bill type="s" number="930">S. 930</bill>, the "College Affordability and Access Act," which contained three provisions designed to expand access to higher education, and reduce its cost. These three provisions were enacted into law, in amended form, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal I am submitting today builds upon each of those three provisions. First, in recognition of the increased cost of higher education, my proposal calls for an increase in the tax deduction available for interest paid on higher education loans. Second, my proposal calls for a similar increase in the contribution limit for tax-free Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. Third, the bill would make permanent the current tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The value of the tax relief we provided 10 years ago has not kept pace with the rising cost of higher education. According to data from the College Board, 4-year private colleges now charge $30,000 per year for tuition, fees, room, and board. Even after taking inflation into account, this represents an increase of more than $6,000 since the 1996-1997 school year. Perhaps even more troubling, the College Board reports that the rate of increase has actually been sharper at public 4-year institutions  than their private counterparts. Ten years ago, students attending any of America's excellent public universities would have paid, on average, just over $9,000 to cover tuition, fees, room, and board. Today, these  students can expect to pay nearly $12,800--an increase of 38 percent after taking inflation into account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By contrast, the student loan interest deduction we provided as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 remains at $2,500. It is time that we raise this cap to $3,750, a 50-percent increase. Doing so is a step toward recognizing that investments in higher education are essential to the health of our economy in an increasingly global, competitive marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe it is necessary to increase the contribution limits for Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. Under current law, taxpayers may make contributions of up to $2,000 per year to these tax-free higher education accounts. In light of the inflation in college costs that I have already described, I believe this contribution limit ought to be increased to $3,000 per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, my proposal would also extend current education benefits provided to employees through their employers. Under current law, a taxpayer may receive, tax free, up to $5,250 in education benefits through their employers each year. This provision helps both companies and their employees. Companies that provide this benefit get a workforce that is current with the latest methods and technologies in the field, while their employees get the training they need to advance through the ranks. Unfortunately,  this provision expires on December 31, 2010. I propose that it be made permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time for us to make a commitment to raising the Pell maximum award to $5,100, and to providing additional relief to families struggling to afford higher education. Investing in higher education is crucial to our economic future and competitiveness in the global economy, and my legislation represents a sound investment towards making the dream of a college education a reality for more Americans. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="455">S. 455</bill>] Mr. President, today Senator Smith and I are introducing the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007. This legislation will help those who are valiantly serving their country and the families that they leave behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who wear the uniform of our country. That means giving our troops the resources they need to keep them safe while they are protecting us. And it means supporting our troops at home as well as abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are over 132,000 military personnel serving in Iraq and more are on the way. There are approximately 22,100 U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan. Many of these men and women are reservists and have been called to activity duty, frequently for multiple tours. Often they own, or are employed, by a small business and their activation results in hardship for the business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small businesses with less than 100 employees employ about 18 percent of all reservists who hold civilian jobs. Most large businesses have the resources to provide supplemental income to reservist employees called up and to replace them with temporary employees. I applaud the businesses that have been able to pay supplemental income to their reservists, but it is not easy for small businesses to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee held a hearing on veterans' small business issues. A majority of our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are Reserve and National Guard members--35 percent of whom are either self-employed or own or are employed by a small business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard some disturbing statistics about the impact and unintended consequences the callup of reservists is having on small businesses. According to a January 2007 survey conducted by Workforce Management, 54 percent of the businesses surveyed responded that they would not hire a citizen soldier if they knew that they could be called up for an indeterminate amount of time. I am concerned that long callups have made it hard for small businesses to be supportive of civilian soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 provides a tax credit to small businesses with fewer than 100 employees and the self-employed to help with the cost of paying the salary of their reservist employees when they are called to active duty. This legislation also provides an additional tax credit to help offset the cost of hiring temporary employees to fill vacancies left by the servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many reservists who own their own business return from duty to find that their business is floundering. These tax credits will help reservists who own their own businesses to hire temporary employees for the duration of their tour as well as to assist small businesses deal with the impact of having an essential employee called up for active duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to helping small businesses, the Active Duty Military Tax Relief of 2007 addresses concerns related to differential military pay, income tax withholding, and retirement plan participation. These provisions will make it easier for employers who would like to pay their employees supplemental income, above their military pay, and make pension contributions. Our legislation would make differential military pay subject to Federal income tax withholding. In addition, with respect to the  retirement plan rules, the bill provides that a person receiving differential military pay would be treated as an employee of the employer making the payment and allows the differential military pay to be treated as compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also attempts to mitigate the financial strains placed on our military families while the family member is deployed. To help ease some of this burden, the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 would increase the standard deduction for active duty military personnel by $1,000 for 2007 and 2008. In addition, this legislation would make permanent the existing provision which allows taxpayers to include combat pay as earned income for purposes of the earned income tax credit (EITC).  Without this provision some military families would no longer be eligible to receive the EITC because combat pay is currently not taxable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, Senator Smith and I introduced the Fallen Heroes Family Savings Act, which we have incorporated into the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act. This provision provides tax relief for the death gratuity payment that is given to families that have lost a loved one in combat. This payment is currently $100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our current tax laws do not allow the recipients of this payment to use it to make contributions to tax-preferred saving accounts that help with saving for retirement, health care, or the costs of education. Our legislation would allow military death gratuities to be contributed to certain tax-preferred accounts. These contributions would be treated as qualified rollovers. The contribution limits of these accounts will not be applied to these contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our service men and women need to know that we are honoring their valor by taking care of those they leave behind. Helping ease the tax burden on the death gratuity will enable military families to save more for retirement, education, and health care by allowing them to put the payment in an account in which the earnings will accumulate tax-free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These changes to our tax laws will help our military families with some of their financial burdens. It cannot repay the sacrifices they have made for us, but it is a small way we can support our troops and their families at home as well as abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Military Family Association, the Reserve Officers Association, and The Military Coalition (a consortium of veterans and military organizations representing more than 5.5 million members plus their families and survivors) support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 456. A bill to increase and enhance law enforcement resources committed to investigation and prosecution of violent gangs, to deter and punish violent gang crime, to protect law-abiding citizens and communities from violent criminals, to revise and enhance criminal penalties for violent crimes, to expand and improve gang prevention programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="456">S. 456</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator HATCH and a bipartisan group of at least 15 original cosponsors in introducing comprehensive antiaging legislation--the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will provide a comprehensive approach to gang violence by: helping those on the front lines of enforcement, by adopting new criminal laws and tougher penalties against those who commit gang-related and other violent acts; authorizing hundreds of millions of dollars for gang-related investigations and prosecutions, and new funds for witness protection; and identifying successful community programs, and investing significant resources in schools and civic and religious organizations to  prevent teenagers and other young people from joining gangs in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 10 of this year, officials in Van Nuys, CA, reported that two teenage boys were shot in a reported gang-related shooting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks earlier, on December 29, Visalia, CA, law enforcement officials reported two separate shootings and the wounding of two minors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 24, San Diego officials noted how a 16 year old was shot in the leg in gang violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 22, a 9-year-old girl in Los Angeles was just washing dishes with her mom inside her home--until gang members exchanged fire across the street, and a bullet tore through the front wall of her house and struck her in the head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that came 5 days after Cheryl Green, a 14-year-old black girl who was talking to friends, was shot and killed by two Hispanic gang members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New York Times just reported on the Cheryl Green shooting, but unfortunately, I see gang violence in the news almost every day in California, with gang-related shootings of children almost too numerous to count. Perhaps the worst occurred last September, when Los Angeles experienced a new low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three-year-old Kaitlyn Avila was shot point-blank by a gang member who mistakenly thought her father was a member of a rival gang. The gang member shot and wounded her father, then intentionally fired into little Kaitlyn's chest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the first time ever that law enforcement officials remember a young child being "targeted" in a gang-related shooting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this shooting is only a symptom of the disease that has taken hold of our cities--gang violence. The violence perpetrated by gang members affects not only those associated with gangs, but also police officers and innocent bystanders. It impacts not only individuals, but also our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It stops mothers from allowing their children to play outside. It prevents  the elderly from taking walks in their neighborhoods. And it creates an environment of fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time for the Federal Government to provide a hand of assistance to state and local law enforcement. And it is past time to come to grips with our country's escalating levels of gang violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month the FBI released its Uniform Crime Report for the first half of 2006. The news was disturbing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report showed an alarming increase in homicides, assaults, robberies and other violent crimes across the U.S.--a surge of nearly 3.7 percent for the first 6 months of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, of course follows on the heels of the FBI's 2005 figures, which had showed a 2.5 percent jump in violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time, those 2005 figures had represented the largest increase in violent crime in the U.S. in 15 years. But this newly announced increase for the first half of 2006 is almost 50 percent higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, a big part of this increase is due to gang violence. Just as we heard when the 2005 figures were released, criminologists point to the spread of violent street gangs as a major cause of the 2006 increase in violent crime as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The warnings we have received about the links between the increase in violent crime and gangs have been steady and consistent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the FBI announced its 2005 figures last June, the Washington Post reported how criminal justice experts specifically identified "an influx of gangs into medium-sized cities" as a big reason for this increase. According to the Los Angeles Times, Houston police attributed their 2005 increase to gang members who evacuated New Orleans after Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the 2006 figures were announced, the Washington Post quoted criminologist James Alan Fox, who described how "[w]e have many high-crime areas where gangs have made a comeback." The L.A. Times noted how "[e]xperts said the crime upsurge reflected an increase in gang violence, particularly in midsized cities." Cities like Houston, which experienced a massive 28 percent increase in violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The headline for the Sacramento Bee, reporting on the FBI's 31 percent reported increase in violent crime for that county, said it all: "Gangs blamed for increase, which is part of [a] national hike in mayhem in '06."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even among the cities that experienced a 2006 reduction in violent crime--such as Los Angeles, which moved into the ranks of the safest cities in the U.S.--Mayor Villairaigosa described gang violence as the "glaring exception." Gang crime was up by 14 percent in Los Angeles--and up 40 percent in San Fernando Valley, and 57 percent of Los Angeles' 478 homicides for 2006 were attributed to gangs--up 50 percent from 2005. And 86 percent of those murder victims were African American or Latino.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can no longer be serious debate that gang violence is a big part of this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem of gang violence in America is daunting. According to the FBI, there are now at least 30,000 gangs nationwide, with 800,000 members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In California, the State attorney general now estimates that there are 171,000 juveniles and adults committed to criminal street gangs and their way of life. That's greater than the population of 28 California counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1992 to 2003, there were more than 7,500 gang-related homicides reported in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, more than one-third of the 2,000 homicides in California--698--were gang-related.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is worse among teens and young adults. In that same year, nearly 50 percent of the murders of 18 to 29 year olds were gang related. And nearly 60 percent of the murders of teens under 18 were gang related.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list of people murdered by gangs includes some of our finest law enforcement officers:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oceanside Police Officer, Dan Bessant, gunned down from behind just last month, in an incident described as eerily similar to a similar killing in 2003, when Oceanside Police Officer, Tony Zepetella, was shot and killed by a known gang member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Los Angeles Police Officer Ricardo Lizarraga, killed while responding to a domestic violence call, by a man who drew a gun and shot him twice in the back. The suspect was a known member of the Rollin20s Bloods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Merced Police Officer Stephan Gray, a member of his department's gang violence unit. Gray was shot and killed when a suspect--a gang member he had encountered before--fired two bullets into his chest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Los Angeles Sherriff's Deputy Jeffrey Ortiz: As a member of his department's anti-gang task force, Ortiz had been going door to door in a gang-plagued neighborhood of L.A. He had just knocked on a door and was checking IDs when he was shot in the head at point-blank range. The alleged gunman is a suspected gang member wanted on an outstanding warrant for attempted murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Burbank Police Officer Matthew Pavelka: Two gunmen whom he had stopped for driving without license plates got out and showered him with gunfire. They were allegedly affiliated with the Vineland Boys gang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California Highway Patrol Officer Thomas Steiner, killed after walking out of the Pomona courthouse after testifying in a series of traffic cases, by a 16-year-old intent on "killing a cop" to prove himself to the Pomona 12th street gang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>San Francisco Police Officer Isaac Espinoza: The first San Francisco police officer slain on duty in more than a decade, killed when an apparent "Westmob" gang member fired 14 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gang killings also impact children and families. Unfortunately, 3-year-old Kaitlyn Avila is not alone: There is also 11-year-old Mynisha Crenshaw of San Bernardino, CA, a little girl shot and killed in November 2005;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven-week-old infant Glenn "Baby G" Molex, shot and killed on September 28, 2003, by one of the "Down Below" Gang after 28 bullets penetrated his family's apartment in San Francisco's Bayview District;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joseph Swift, a 13-year-old boy shot outside a home after attending church in Los Angeles in 2003; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eight-year-old Sunny Elijah Peralez, shot in East Los Angeles by the Ghetto Boyz in 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this problem extends far beyond California--as evidenced by 8-year-old Kyron Butler, killed by a stray bullet during a Jersey Park Boys gang shootout in Smithfield, VA, in 2003, and 9-year-old Genesis Gonzalez, a little girl shot by a car of Crips gang members in Nevada in 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As gangs have continued to spread across our country, increasing in violence and power in every State, they are no longer just a big city problem. They have metastasized from Los Angeles and Chicago to the medium and smaller cities where they face less competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI now estimates that gangs are having an impact on at least 2,500 communities across the nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the latest FBI statistics, violent crime and murder grew fastest in the midsized and smaller cities--not in our largest urban areas. The average midsized city, in fact, had a surge in overall violent crime of more than 5 percent in a single year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that gangs engage in drug trafficking, robbery, extortion, prostitution, gun trafficking, and murder. They destroy neighborhoods, cripple families and kill innocent people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton put it bluntly:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing more insidious than these gangs. They are worse than the Mafia. Show me a year in New York where the Mafia indiscriminately killed 300 people. You can't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national gang problem is immense and growing, and it is not going away. Our cities and States need help. The many law enforcement officers that have spoken to me and others in my office say one thing clearly--short-term infusions are great, but what they really need is a long-term Federal commitment to combat gang violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A massive report just prepared for the City of Los Angeles even suggested that what is needed is a "Marshal Plan" initiative to combat gang violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Hatch and I have been introducing comprehensive Federal gang legislation for over a decade. Our gang bills have been modified and refined over the years, most recently in legislation that we negotiated with the House for possible inclusion in the DOD Authorization bill last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we introduce today essentially takes that bill, but removes  all of its new death penalties. It has no mandatory minimums, and we have eliminated juvenile justice changes that previously proved to be an impediment to the larger bill's passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we offer today will provide a comprehensive solution to gang violence, combining enforcement and prevention efforts in a collaborative approach that has proven effective in models like Operation Ceasefire, and in Modesto, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would establish new Federal gang crimes and tougher Federal penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's Federal street gang laws are frankly weak, and are almost never used. Currently, a person committing a gang crime might have extra time tacked on to the end of their Federal sentence. That is because Federal law currently focuses on gang violence only as a sentencing enhancement, rather than a crime unto itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that I offer today would make it a separate Federal crime for any criminal street gang member to commit, conspire or attempt to commit violent crimes--including murder, kidnapping, arson, extortion--in furtherance of the gang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the penalties for gang members committing such crimes would increase considerably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For gang-related murder, kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse or maiming, the penalties would range up to life imprisonment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For any other serious violent felony, the penalty would range up to 30 years--which in the Federal system means without parole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for other crimes of violence--defined as the actual or intended use of physical force against the person of another--the penalty could bring up to 20 years in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would also create a new crime for recruiting juveniles and adults into a criminal street gang, with a penalty of up to 10 years, or if the recruiting involved a juvenile or recruiting from prison, up to 20 years;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Create new Federal crimes for committing violent crimes in connection with drug trafficking, and increase existing penalties for violent crimes in aid of racketeering;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enact a host of other violent crime reforms, including closing a loophole that had allowed carjackers to avoid convictions, increasing the penalties for those who use guns in violent crimes or transfer guns knowing they will be used in crimes, limiting bail for violent felons who possess firearms, and in a number of other respects cracking down harder on those who commit violent crimes; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make a long-term Federal commitment to fight gangs, by authorizing over $1 billion in new funds over the next 5 years for enforcement, prevention, and witness protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would include $500 million for the development of High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas, or HIIGAAs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These HIIGAAs would mirror the successful HIDTA--High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area model--under which Federal, State and local agents coordinate investigations and prosecutions. And this $500 million would also be split 50/50, so that for every dollar spent on law enforcement, a dollar would be spent on prevention and intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This balanced approach--of prevention and intervention plus tough penalties--will send a clear message to gang members: a new day has arrived. This bill will provide them with new opportunities, with schools and social services agencies empowered to make alternatives to gangs a realistic option. But if gang members continue to engage in violence, they will face new and serious Federal consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to report that this bill has already been endorsed by the National Sheriff's Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the National Association of Police Officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 10 years now, Senator Hatch and I have been trying to pass Federal anti-gang legislation. There have been times when we have gotten close. Unfortunately, while Congress has failed to act, violent street gangs have only expanded nationwide and become more empowered and entrenched in other States and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this bill can pass the Senate and be enacted into law, especially after these changes that we have made and our previous negotiations conducted with members of the House and Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has arrived for us to finally address this problem, and this bill is well-suited to help solve it. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 460. A bill to make determinations by the United States Trade Representative under title III of the Trade Act of 1974 reviewable by the Court of International Trade and to ensure that the United States Trade Representative considers petitions to enforce United States Trade rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="460">S. 460</bill>] Mr. President, when reflecting on the attributes that have made our great country prosperous--its free market system, its hard-working and enterprising people, its treasured natural resources--we must not overlook the rule of law as an equal, if not paramount element of the blessings we have secured. Since our Nation's founding, Americans have recognized that the success of worthy enterprises in a functioning market require the government--rather than choosing winners and losers--to  consistently and dispassionately enforce the rules that bind all actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our legal system evolved over the course of centuries to provide for the rule of law throughout our country, the fates of American people and businesses have become increasingly bound to counterparts in the world beyond our borders. Whether called "Globalization", "Internationalization" or some other moniker, the rapidly growing number of connections between suppliers, consumers and financiers across national boundaries means that agreements breached and laws broken on the far side  of the world can harm companies and workers here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet our government has failed to adapt to this new reality. While foreign governments engage in market-distorting currency manipulation, refuse to protect intellectual property rights and turn a blind eye to labor exploitation--each a violation of trade obligations to the United States--ours demurs with communiques and consultations, rather than formal enforcement action. What makes this abdication of its duty to defend the U.S. economy from unfair foreign practices especially troubling is that  the tools to do so already exist in the dispute resolution provisions of various trade agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distressing reality is that U.S. industry and labor groups are often rebuffed in attempts to petition the United States Trade Representative to initiate a formal investigation or bring a dispute resolution action under the relevant multilateral or bilateral trade agreement, as there seems to be considerable institutional momentum among senior officials at USTR and elsewhere in the Administration against bringing formal enforcement action against certain trade partners, and China in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USTR's handling of the trade effects of China's currency manipulation practices is representative of the problem. In September 2004, a U.S. industry coalition filed a petition under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974--the statute setting forth general procedures for the enforcement of U.S. trade rights--alleging that Chinese currency manipulation practices constituted a violation of China's obligations to the United States under World Trade Organization rules, and calling for USTR to conduct  an investigation of such practices. USTR rejected the petition on the day it was filed, contending that "an investigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, and practices covered in the petition. The Administration is currently involved in efforts to address with the Government of China the currency valuation issues raised in the petition. The USTR</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted in USTR's rejection of these petitions, current law allows the Executive to decline to initiate an industry- requested investigation where it determines that action under Section 301 would be ineffective in addressing the offending act, policy or practice. The merits of USTR's determination are unreviewable under current law. USTR used this loophole to avoid having to even investigate industry's claim, let alone take formal action against China.  And as we now know, the Administration's "soft" approach to Chinese currency manipulation has itself proven ineffective in addressing the problem in the two years since these filings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is to prevent further disregard for U.S. businesses and workers seeking a fair and consequential hearing of their concerns with foreign trade practices that Senator ROCKEFELLER and I today introduce the Trade Complaint and Litigation Accountability Improvement Measures Act, or the "Trade CLAIM Act".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trade CLAIM Act would amend the Section 301 process to require the United States Trade Representative to act upon an interested party's petition to take formal action in cases where a U.S. trade right has been violated, except in instances where: the matter has already been addressed by the relevant trade dispute settlement body; the foreign country is taking imminent steps to end to ameliorate the effects of the practice; taking action would do more harm than good to the U.S. economy; or  taking action would cause serious harm to the national security of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would also grant the Court of International Trade jurisdiction to review de novo USTR's denials of Section 301 industry petitions to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair foreign trade laws or practices. Such jurisdiction would include the ability to review USTR determinations that U.S. trade rights have not been violated as alleged in industry petitions, and the sufficiency of formal actions taken by USTR in response to foreign trade laws or practices determined to  violate U.S. trade rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trade CLAIM Act would give U.S. businesses and workers a greater say in whether, when and how U.S. trade rights should be enforced. The bill would be particularly beneficial to small businesses, which--like other petitioners in Section 301 cases--currently have no avenue to formally challenge the merits of USTR's decisions, and are often drowned out by large business interests in industry-wide Section 301 actions initiated by USTR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing for judicial review of USTR decisions not to enforce U.S. trade rights, the bill provides for impartial third party oversight by a specialty court not subject to political and diplomatic pressures. In delinking discreet trade disputes from the mercurial machinations of international relations, this Act would end the sacrifice of individual industries on the negotiating table, and leave it to the free market--uniformly operating under the trade rules to which our trading partners  have already agreed--to decide their fate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to resolve a Nevada water rights matter that has lasted more than a decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley Water Rights Settlement Act, would ratify an agreement reached last fall by the State of Nevada, the Tribes, many individual water users, and the United States. I am pleased that the parties came together, asserted their interests, made compromises, and reached an agreement. Each party had different--and frequently conflicting--water claims, water needs, and ideas on water use and conservation. I appreciate the parties' hard work and their  commitment to end expensive litigation to reach an agreement that will permanently resolve the water rights matters along the East Fork of the Owyhee River. This bill, if enacted, will ratify the agreement reached by the parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary purpose of this bill is to approve, ratify and confirm the agreement that addresses the Tribes' water rights, the rights of upstream water users, and the implementation of a plan for the parties to exercise their water rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Agreement quantifies the Tribes' surface water rights and groundwater claims in Nevada. The Tribes will establish a water code and administer the quantified rights on the Reservation accordingly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Agreement also states that the water rights of the upstream water users who live off the Reservation will be determined and administered by the State Engineer. Under the settlement, the parties have agreed to a limitation on the number of acres that can be irrigated by the upstream water users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The settlement's implementation plan describes how the rights of the respective parties will be administered and disputes will be resolved. It describes that the surface water basin will be closed, and provides that a groundwater basin will be declared a basin in need of additional administration under state law. The agreement further addresses operation of the system particularly during times of shortage. Under this part of the plan, upstream water users gain a small amount of water storage  in the Wild Horse Reservoir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second purpose of this bill is to settle the Tribes' long-standing claims against the United States for damages caused by the Bureau of Reclamation's Duck Valley Irrigation Project, related Bureau of Indian Affairs projects, and the mismanagement of tribal resources, particularly the destruction of the Tribe's salmon and steelhead trout fishing stock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Shoshone-Paiutes have a long history in Nevada and Idaho. The Tribes roamed the region well before the Duck Valley Reservation was established by Executive Order in 1877. The Reservation today encompasses approximately 290,000 acres of land held in trust by the federal government for the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reservation draws water from three primary sources: 1. the East Fork of the Owyhee River that flows through the Reservation from south to north from the Nevada side; 2. Blue Creek, a tributary to the Owyhee that flows north to south through the Reservation until it meets the Owyhee on the Idaho side of the Reservation; and 3. Mary's Creek, located in the northeastern part of the Reservation, flowing northeasterly through the Reservation and into Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Duck Valley Indian Irrigation Project was initiated in the 1930s, the project placed over 12,000 acres of land under irrigation. Like many Indian water projects, the Project was only partially completed and never fully funded, which accounted for the Projects' disrepair, resulted in reduced storage capacity, and an inability to reach the goal of maximizing the acres in production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the construction of the Bureau of Reclamation's Owyhee Irrigation Project Dam in the 1930s, the Tribes' salmon runs were destroyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The affects of these federal projects on the Tribes' resources and culture and the Federal Government's failure to protect tribal water rights require places the United States in the position of compensating the Tribes for their loss. The Tribes value the loss to their resources and culture at level much higher than what Senator Ensign and I propose. While the United States can never fully compensate the Tribes for their loss, I appreciate the Tribes' willingness to accept the settlement figure  and put an end to this painful part of our sovereign-to-sovereign relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, if enacted, would authorize two settlement funds--a development fund and a maintenance fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The development fund, to be authorized at $45 million over 5 fiscal years, would fund tribal water development projects. After careful research and consultation with its members and advisors, the Tribes have identified many projects to increase their economic opportunities. The Tribes are preparing to rehabilitate the dilapidated Duck Valley Irrigation Project, increase the amount of irrigable lands in agricultural production, develop a Wildlife Habitat Project, and undertake other economic development  projects to enhance the Reservation economy and contribute to the permanent homeland purpose of the Duck Valley Reservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The maintenance fund, authorized at $15 million over 5 fiscal years, would fund the refurbishment and maintenance of the Reservation's water infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley Water Rights Settlement Act is important legislation. It reflects the compromises of our constituents who worked hard to reach agreement on matters that affect their livelihoods and cultures. I believe this bill benefit the Tribes, the ranchers and upstream water users, and those residents in the northern Nevada and southern Idaho region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to ensure timely review and passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to clarify when organizations described in section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 must register as political committees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="463">S. 463</bill>] Mr. President, once again I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and colleague Senator Feingold from Wisconsin in introducing a bill to end the illegal practice of 527 groups spending soft money on ads and other activities to influence Federal elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is very simple. It would require that all 527s register as political committees and comply with Federal campaign finance laws, including Federal limits on the contributions they receive, unless the money they raise and spend is only in connection with non-Federal candidate elections, State or local ballot initiatives, or the nomination or confirmation of individuals to non-elected offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this legislation would set new rules for Federal political committees that spend funds on voter mobilization efforts effecting both Federal and local races and, therefore, use both a Federal and a non-Federal account under Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulation. The new rules would prevent unlimited soft money from being channeled into Federal election activities by these Federal political committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the new rules that would be established under this bill, at least half of the funds spent on these voter mobilization activities by Federal political committees would have to be hard money from their Federal account. More importantly, the funds raised for their non-Federal account would have to come from individuals and would be limited to no more than $25,000 per year per donor. Corporations and labor unions could not contribute to these non-Federal accounts. To put it in simple terms,  a George Soros could give $25,000 per year as opposed to $10 million to finance these activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate that we even need to be here introducing this bill today. This legislation would not be necessary if the FEC would enforce existing law. As my colleagues know, a number of 527 groups raised and spent a substantial amount of soft money in a blatant effort to influence the outcome of the 2004 Presidential election. These activities are illegal under existing laws,  but, unfortunately, the FEC has failed to implement the regulations necessary  to stop these illegal activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to an analysis by campaign finance scholar Tony Corrado, federally oriented 527s spent $423 million to affect the outcome of the 2004 elections. The same analysis shows that ten donors gave at least $4 million each to 527s involved in the 2004 elections and two donors each contributed over $20 million. Let me be perfectly clear on one point here. Our proposal will NOT shut down 527s. It will simply require them to abide by the same Federal regulations every other Federal political committee  must abide by in spending money to influence Federal elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of campaign finance reform like to point out that the activities of these 527s serve as proof that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) has failed in its stated purpose, which is to eliminate the corrupting influence of soft money in our political campaigns. Let me be perfectly clear on this. The 527 issue has nothing to do with BCRA, it has everything to do with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 and the failure of the FEC to properly regulate the activities of these groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill Senator Feingold and I are introducing today is designed to put an end to the abusive, illegal practices of these 527s. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill and put an end to this problem once and for all.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="Introducing S. 463. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to clarify when organizations described in section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 must register as political committees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to be working once again with my partner in reform, the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, to introduce the 527 Reform Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our purpose is simple--to pass legislation that will do what the FEC could and should do under current law, but, once again, has failed to do. Current Federal election law requires these groups to register as political committees and to stop raising and spending soft money. But the FEC has failed to enforce the law, so we must act in the Congress. This bill will make it absolutely clear that the federal election laws apply to 527 organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had to something similar with BCRA, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which passed in 2002, closing the soft money loophole that the FEC created in the late '70s and expanded in the '90s. That struggle took seven years. We have now been seeking to bring 527s within the law for four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will require all 527s to register as political committees unless they fall into a number of narrow categories. The exceptions are basically for groups that Congress exempted from disclosure requirements because they are so small or for groups that are involved exclusively in State election activity. Once a group registers as a political committee, certain activities, such as ads that mention only Federal candidates, will have to be paid for solely with hard money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current rules, the FEC permits Federal political committees to maintain a non-Federal account to pay a portion of the expenses of activities that affect both Federal and non-Federal elections. Our bill sets new allocation rules that will make sure that these allocable activities are paid for with at least 50 percent hard money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill makes an important change with respect to the non-federal portion of the allocable activities. We put a limit of $25,000 per year on the contributions that can be accepted for that non-federal account. This means no more million dollar soft money contributions to pay for get-out-the-vote efforts in the presidential campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing in this bill will affect legitimate 501(c) advocacy groups. The bill only applies to groups that claim a tax exemption under section 527.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having laid out the central components of the bill, let me discuss how this bill has evolved, and the differences between this bill and the bill we introduced in 2005. In the last Congress, we made a great deal of progress working with the Senator from Mississippi, who at the time chaired the Rules Committee. Prior to taking the bill to a markup in the spring of 2005, Senator Lott worked with us to clarify the bill and address some of the concerns that had been raised about it. The bill  we are introducing today is identical to the "Chairman's Mark" that Senator Lott brought before the Rules Committee last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the original bill exempted 527s engaged exclusively in state elections from the registration requirement, it denied the exemption to groups that carry out "voter drive activities"--defined as get-out-the vote, voter ID, or voter registration--during a federal election year. This made the exemption too narrow, so we looked for another way to ensure that state 527s that only work on behalf of non-Federal officeholders will not have to become Federal PACs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chairman's Mark, and this year's bill, completely exempt organizations of State and local candidates or officeholders. Groups such as the Democratic Governors Association, Republican Governors Association, or a state legislative caucus would be exempt, as long as their voter drive activities only mention state candidates or ballot issues. These groups do not qualify for the exemption, however, if they mention Federal candidates in their communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill provides a slightly narrower exemption for State PACs that are active only in State elections. The only additional requirements for these PACs to qualify for an exemption are that they can only be active in a single State, and they cannot have a candidate for Federal office or Federal officeholder controlling or participating in the organization or raising money for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we made a number of changes to ensure that Federal PACs that allocate expenditures can use non-Federal money for expenditures designed only to assist State candidates even if they make an incidental reference to a Federal candidate or political party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The changes to the legislation that we made last year working with Senator Lott prior to the Rules Committee markup have been carried forward in the bill we introduce today. They improved and strengthened the bill. Unfortunately, other amendments were added during the Rules Committee consideration of the bill that we could not support. So the bill that we are introducing today is the same as the bill that went to markup in 2005, not the bill that was reported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me remind my colleagues that the soft money loophole was first opened by FEC rulings in the late '70s. By the time we started work on BCRA, the problem had mushroomed and led to the scandals we saw in the 1996 campaign. When we passed BCRA, I said we would have to be vigilant to make sure that the FEC enforced the law and that similar loopholes did not develop. That is what we are trying to do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no doubt that if we don't act on this 527 problem now, we will see more problems explode into scandals over the next few election cycles. In the 2004 cycle, Federal-oriented 527s spend $423 million. In fact, there were two donors who each contributed over $20 million. We cannot afford to wait until another presidential campaign season is in full bloom before addressing this problem. This FEC-ordained loophole threatens to further undermine the federal election laws. We must close it this  year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="Introducing S. 466. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of an end-of-life planning consultation as part of an initial preventive physical examination under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="466">S. 466</bill>] Mr. President, death is by no means an easy subject to talk about; nonetheless, end-of-life care continues to be a controversial topic that must be addressed. Today, I am introducing three bills that I hope will go a long way to improve end-of-life care in this country. Senator Susan Collins and I are reintroducing our Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act, comprehensive legislation that would ensure that patients' final wishes for end-of-life care are known, respected,  and complied with. This legislation has been introduced in each Congress since the 105th Congress. I am hopeful that we will be able to move it this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also introducing the Medicare End-of-Life Care Planning Act with Senators Lugar and Bill Nelson. This important bill is based on an amendment that I introduced during the Finance Committee's consideration of the Deficit Reduction Act in 2005. It would require physician consultation regarding advance directives during the initial "Welcome to Medicare" physician visit. An end-of-life care consultation during a Medicare recipient's first contact with the program would emphasize  the importance of advance planning and give him or her the tools necessary to understand advance directives, the Medicare hospice benefit, and other end-of-life care concerns. Having such a benefit in Medicare would undoubtedly improve patient care and quality at the end-of-life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final bill that I would like to talk about today is the Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act, legislation that I am cosponsoring with Senators Bill Nelson and Richard Lugar. The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act complements both of the bills I am introducing today. It includes my language on the "Welcome to Medicare" doctor's visit, which I believe is critical, but it also includes two other important provisions. It improves the policies for  use and portability of advance directives across state lines, and it directs the Secretary of HHS to conduct a public education campaign on the importance of end-of-life planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to be an author of each of these bills. As we have seen recently with the well-publicized case of Terri Shiavo, end-of-life decision making can be confusing and cause added anguish to an already sorrowful situation. The delicate nature of life and love make it very difficult to create strict rules governing end-of-life care, nor should we want to. In its present form, however, end-of-life planning and care for most Americans is perplexing, disjointed, and lacking an active dialogue.  We can, and must, take action to make this process as easy as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not surprising that we face this problem. Health care professionals frequently use terms that are too technical or confusing for the average person. Patients who appear too sick to participate in the discussions may be excluded from determining their own destiny. And all too often the entire conversation never happens due to the discomfort of all parties involved. As a result, patients and families, suffer needlessly during these already difficult times. A report issued by the Institute  of Medicine Committee on Care at the End of Life stated that, and I quote, "suffering arises when the aggressive use of ineffectual or intrusive interventions serves to prolong the period of dying unnecessarily or to dishonor the dying person's wishes about care. Too often,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these shortcomings, the evidence tells us that most people want to discuss advanced directives when they are healthy and they want their families involved in the process. According to the American Psychological Association, almost 60 percent of individuals 65 or older state that they want their family to be given choices about treatment should they become incapacitated rather than leaving the decision up to physicians. How can we allow these serious problems to persist when dealing with  the lives of our family and friends?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Death is hard to think about. Death is hard to talk about. And the final period of time leading up to our death is hard to plan. But we must encourage our family, our friends, and our loved ones to discuss this difficult topic in an open and effective manner in order to avoid any additional pain when a loved one passes away. We must also provide them the best tools to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am introducing today accomplishes this objective by developing standards for end-of-life care, facilitating opportunities for patients to discuss end-of-life issues with a trained professional, and authorizing funds for demonstration projects on innovative approaches to end-of-life care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Death is a serious, personal, and complicated issue that is eventually relevant to each and every one of us. Americans deserve end-of-life care that is effective in fulfilling individual wishes, avoiding unnecessary disputes, and, most importantly, providing quality end-of-life care. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join us in improving end-of-life care and reducing the amount of grief that inevitably comes with losing those who we hold dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of each of these bills be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="Introducing S. 466. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of an end-of-life planning consultation as part of an initial preventive physical examination under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues and cosponsors Senators JAY ROCKEFELLER and RICHARD LUGAR as we introduce the Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007 has a simple purpose: to encourage all adults in America, especially those 65 and older, to think about, talk about and write down their wishes for medical care near the end of life should they become unable to make decisions for themselves. Advance directives, which include a living will stating the individual's preferences for care, and a power of attorney for health care, are critical documents that each of us should have. The goal  is clear, but reaching it requires that we educate the public about the importance of advance directives, offer opportunities for discussion of the issues, and reinforce the requirement that health care providers honor patients' wishes. This bill is designed to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007 would encourage new Medicare beneficiaries to prepare advance directives by including a physician consultation on advance directives in each "Welcome to Medicare" physical exam. This initial consultation would cover the importance of preparing advance directives, when these documents are most likely to be used, and where to find additional resources and information. The conversation will also enable physicians to learn about their  patients' wishes, fears, religious beliefs, and life experiences that might influence their medical care wishes. These are important aspects of a physician-patient relationship that are too often unaddressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another part of our bill would provide funds for the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to conduct a public education campaign to raise awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end of life. This campaign would explain what advance directives are, where they are available, what questions need to be asked and answered, and what to do with the executed documents. HHS, directly or through grants, would also establish an information clearinghouse where consumers could receive  State-specific information and consumer-friendly documents and publications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also contains language that would make all advance directives "portable," that is, useful from one State to another. If an out-of-State directive is presented, it will be presumed valid unless the health care provider can reasonably demonstrate that it is not an authentic expression of the individual's wishes concerning his or her health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know about the tragic situation that occurred in Florida with Terri Schiavo and her family. She was  a young woman who was the subject of a debate about her treatment between her husband and her parents, a debate that was a court case and a legislative quagmire. Most experts agree that if she had an advance directive that made her wishes clear and named a health care proxy, there would have been no question as to who could decide the course of  her care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the great legacies of Terri Schiavo's life will be that she began a national dialogue about end-of-life care and got people discussing living wills. Regardless of our views on the ethical, legal and constitutional issues surrounding her case, we all can agree that more people now than ever know the importance of having end-of-life discussions with their family, doctor, clergy or attorney. This bill would build upon this national dialogue and encourage more Americans to learn about and  fill out advance directives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body is a legislative institution, not a medical one. We cannot legislate good medical care or compassion. What we can do, what I hope we will do, is to enact this bill so that the American public can participate in improving end-of-life care. If we can do that, we will have done a great deal.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="Introducing S. 468. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to drug safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="468">S. 468</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Access to Clinical Trials (FACT) Act. I want to begin by thanking Senators Grassley, Wyden, Bingaman, Durbin, and Harkin for joining me in introducing this legislation. I also would like to recognize the leadership of Senator Johnson who was involved in the crafting of this legislation from the beginning and who has been a long-standing supporter of the FACT Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will create an electronic databank for clinical trials of drugs, biological products, and medical devices. Such a databank will ensure that physicians, researchers, the general public, and patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials have access to basic information about those trials. It will require manufacturers and other researchers to reveal the results of clinical trials so that clinically important information will be available to all Americans, and physicians will have all the  information necessary to make appropriate treatment decisions for their patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Events of the past few years have made it clear that such a databank is needed. For example, serious questions were raised about the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants when used in children and youth. It has now become clear that the existing data indicates that these drugs may very well put children at risk. However, because the data from antidepressant clinical trials was not publicly available, it took years for this risk to be realized. In the meantime, millions of children have  been prescribed antidepressants by well-meaning physicians. While these drugs undoubtedly helped many of these children, they also led to greater suffering for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The news is similarly disturbing for a popular class of painkillers known as Cox-2 inhibitors. These medicines, taken by millions of Americans, have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events, such as heart attack and stroke. It has been suggested that one of these medicines, which has since been pulled from the market, may have been responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, a drug manufacturer acknowledged that it did not inform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the public about the results of a 67,000 person study it conducted of an FDA-approved drug used commonly during heart surgery to reduce the need for a transfusion. The study revealed the drug may increase patients' risk of death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure, and stroke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of stories that have become all too common. It has been suggested that negative data might actually have been suppressed; and if this is discovered to be the case, those responsible should be dealt with harshly. However, because of what is known as "publication bias," the information available to the public and physicians can be misleading even without nefarious motives. The simple fact is that studies with a positive result are far more likely to  be published, and thus publicly available, than a study with a negative result. Physicians and patients hear the good news. Rarely do they hear the bad news. In the end, the imbalance of available information hurts patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill would correct this imbalance in information, and prevent manufacturers from suppressing negative data. It would do so by creating a two-part databank, consisting of an expansion of clinicaltrials.gov--an existing registry that is operated by the National Library of Medicine (NLM)--and a new database for clinical trial results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the FACT Act, the registry would continue to operate as a resource for patients seeking to enroll in clinical trials for drugs and biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions--and for the first time, it would also include medical device trials. The new results database would include all trials (except for preliminary safety trials), and would require the submission of clinical trial results data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation would enforce the requirement to submit information to the databank in two ways. First, by requiring registration as a condition of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, no trial could begin without submitting preliminary information to the registry and database. This information would include the purpose of the trial, the estimated date of trial completion, as well as all of the information necessary to help patients to enroll in the trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the trial is completed, the researcher or manufacturer is required to submit the results to the database. If they refuse to do so, they are subject to monetary penalties or, in the case of federally-funded research, a restriction on future federal funding. It is my belief that these enforcement mechanisms will ensure broad compliance. However, in the rare case where a manufacturer does not comply, this legislation also gives the FDA the authority to publicize the required information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also say that any time you are collecting large amounts of data and making it public, protecting patient privacy and confidentiality is  paramount. Our legislation would in no way threaten patient privacy. The simple fact is that under this bill, no individually-identifiable information would be available to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the establishment of a clinical trials databank is absolutely necessary for the health and well-being of the American public. But I would also like to highlight two other benefits that such a databank will have. First, it has the potential to reduce health care costs. Studies have shown that publication bias also leads to a bias toward new and more expensive treatment options. A databank could help make it clear that in some cases less expensive treatments are just as effective  for patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, a databank will ensure that the sacrifice made by patients who enroll in clinical trials is not squandered. We owe it to patients to make sure that their  participation in a trial will benefit other individuals suffering from the same illness or condition by making the results of the trial public, no matter the outcome of the trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problems associated with publication bias have recently drawn more attention from the medical community, and there is broad consensus that a clinical trials registry is one of the best ways to address the issue. Accordingly, the American Medical Association (AMA) has recommended creating such a databank. Additionally, the major medical journals have established a policy that they will only publish the results of trials that were registered in a public database before the trial began. Our  legislation meets all of the minimum criteria for a trial registry set out by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. In fact, our bill closely follows recommendations issued by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its recent report on drug safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To its credit, the pharmaceutical industry has also acknowledged the problem, and has created a database where manufacturers can voluntarily submit clinical trials data. I applaud this step. However, if our objective is to provide the public with a complete and consistent supply of information, a voluntary database is unlikely to achieve that goal. Some companies will provide information, but others may decide not to participate. We need a clinical trials framework that is not just fair to all  companies, but provides patients with the peace of mind that they will receive complete information about the medicines they rely on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American drug industry is an extraordinary success story. As a result of the innovations that this industry has spawned, millions of lives have been improved and saved in our country and around the globe. Due to the importance of these medicines to our health and well-being, I have consistently supported sound public policies to help the industry succeed in protecting the public's health and well-being. This legislation aims to build upon the successes of this industry, and help ensure that  the positive changes to our health care system that prescription drugs have brought are not undermined by controversies such as the ones surrounding antidepressants and Cox-2 inhibitors, which are at least in part based on a lack of public information. This bill will help ensure that well-informed patients will use new and innovative medicines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating a clinical trials databank is a critical step toward ensuring the safety of drugs, biological products, and medical devices in this country--but it should not be the end of our efforts. However, other steps are necessary to fully restore patient confidence in the safety of the medicines they rely on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today I am also introducing the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act (FDASA) with Senator Grassley. We are joined by Senators MIKULSKI and BINGAMAN in introducing this legislation and thank them for their support for reforming our nation's system to ensure that FDA-approved drugs being used by millions are safe and effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation would enhance the FDA's drug-safety monitoring system by setting up an independent center within the FDA called the Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics (CPER). This Center would be responsible for monitoring the safety of drugs and biologics once they are on the market, in consultation with other existing Centers at the FDA, and would have the authority to take corrective action if a drug or biologic presents a risk to patients. Under the bill,  the Center Director is authorized to require manufacturers to conduct post-market clinical or observational studies if there are questions about the safety or efficacy of a drug or biologic once it is already on the market. The Center Director can take corrective actions to include labeling changes, restricted distribution, and other risk management tools if an unreasonable risk is found to exist. The bill also</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under our legislation, the Director of CPER will report directly to the FDA Commissioner. Our bill will ensure that CPER consults with the other Centers at FDA as it conducts risk assessments, benefiting from their knowledge and expertise, but not being beholden to them if corrective action is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These new authorities will allow the FDA to act quickly to get answers when there are questions about the safety of a drug, and to act decisively to mitigate the risks when the evidence shows that a drug presents a safety issue. With these authorities, we will never again have a situation where a critical labeling change takes 2 years to complete, as was the case with Vioxx. When we are talking about drugs that are already on the market and in widespread use, any delay can put millions of patients  in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By creating CPER we hope to restore confidence in the medicines that so many Americans rely on to safeguard their health and well-being. Patients should have the peace of mind that the drugs they take to help them will not hurt them instead. We must restore public confidence in the words "FDA-Approved." Unfortunately, events of the past few years have seriously tarnished the FDA's image and put millions of patients at undue risk. Recent developments have cast into doubt the FDA's ability to  ensure that the drugs that it approves are safe--especially once they are on the market. These concerns are bad for patients, bad for physicians, and bad for the pharmaceutical industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many Americans, I have been deeply disturbed by the revelations of the significant risk associated with widely-used medications to treat pain and depression. These revelations raise legitimate questions about the safety of drugs that have already been approved. It would be one thing if these drugs were in a trial phase, but safety issues are being identified in drugs once they are on the market and in widespread use. Health risks significant enough to remove drugs from the market or significantly  restrict their use are becoming clear only after millions of Americans have been exposed to real or potential harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been estimated that more than 100,000 Americans might have been seriously injured or killed by a popular pain medication, while millions of children have been prescribed antidepressants that could put them at risk. This recent spate of popular medicines being identified as unsafe underscores the need to take additional steps to monitor and protect patient safety after a drug has been approved. Allowing the status quo on drug safety at the FDA is unacceptable. Real reform is needed now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An internal study conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General in 2002 revealed that approximately one-fifth of drug reviewers were pressured to approve a drug despite concerns about safety, efficacy, or quality. In addition, more than one-third said they were "not at all" or only "somewhat" confident that final decisions of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) adequately assessed safety. A more recent survey of 997 FDA scientists  conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility found that 420  FDA scientists reported that they knew of cases in which HHS or FDA political appointees inappropriately injected themselves into FDA determinations or actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with industry, physicians, medical journals, patient groups, and my colleagues--including the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi--to move this legislation forward. These bills have already been endorsed by Consumers Union, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), the National Women's Health Network, and Public Citizen. I thank these organizations for lending their  expertise as we crafted these bills. I also want to recognize the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Psychiatric Association for their support in the crafting of the FACT Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clinical trials are critically important to protecting the safety and health of the American public. For this reason, clinical trial results must not be treated as information that can be hidden from scrutiny. Recent events have made it clear that a clinical trials databank is needed. Patients and physicians agree that such a databank is important to our public health. At the same time, there have been disturbing reports that suggest the FDA does not place enough emphasis on drug safety, and  that concerns raised by those in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (formerly the Office of Drug Safety) at CDER are sometimes ignored and even suppressed. Our legislation will ensure that those who are responsible for monitoring the safety of drugs already on</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="Introducing S. 468. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to drug safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to have bipartisan sponsorship of two very important bills with Senator Dodd of Connecticut that are being introduced today, the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2007 and the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These bills are part of a sustained effort to restore public confidence in the Federal Government's food and drug safety program and to make sure the agency does all it can to protect the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enactment of those two bills would provide doctors and patients with more information about the risks and benefits of their medicines and bring about greater transparency and accountability of the Food and Drug Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure my colleagues realize I have been involved in oversight of the Food and Drug Administration for now at least 3 years, and it has been in response to concerns about the reluctance of the Food and Drug Administration to provide information to the public about the increased suicide risks for young people taking antidepressants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November 2004, I chaired a groundbreaking hearing on drug safety involving the Food and Drug Administration and the drug Vioxx. That hearing and other critical drug safety concerns that have come to light since then highlight the need for comprehensive and systematic reforms as well as more stringent oversight of the Food and Drug Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 3 years, it has become increasingly apparent that the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly failed to protect the public from an industry that focuses all too often on profits, even when those profits come at the expense of "John Q. Public."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, then, and because of this, Senator Dodd and I introduced almost identical companion bills to advance serious reforms at the Food and Drug Administration. In the 2 years following the introduction of those bills, however, the Food and Drug Administration failed to take comprehensive and systematic steps toward restoring public confidence in that agency, as well as the necessity of strengthening public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration released its response to the Institute of Medicine's 2006 report on drug safety. The two safety bills introduced today are not intended to supplant the plans articulated in the Food and Drug Administration's response but, rather, to augment those plans and to provide the FDA with additional enforcement tools, something they now lack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, one of our bills is intended to specifically address a serious problem that was also identified by the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Alta Charo, a member of the Institute of Medicine committee that wrote the report on drug safety, stated in the newspaper USA Today:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to confess I'm disappointed that they--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meaning the FDA--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ignored one of our most critical recommendations. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the USA Today article, she was referring to the Institute of Medicine's recommendation that the Food and Drug Administration give more clout to the office that monitors drugs after they go to market. I want you to know I agree with Dr. Charo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2007 would then establish an independent center within the Food and Drug Administration. The name of the center would be the Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics. The director of this center would report directly to the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner and would be responsible for conducting risk assessments for approved drugs and biological products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new center would also be responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs once they are on the market. Unfortunately, the problem we are trying to solve is that now at the FDA, the office that reviews drug safety postmarketing is a mere consultant and under the thumb of the office that puts the drugs on the market in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more troubling is the fact that those who speak out of line are targeted. Whistleblowers, as we call them, are targeted. They are very helpful to Congress in ferreting out wrongdoing, that laws are not being faithfully executed, that money is not being spent according to congressional intent. So they speak out at the FDA and point out a lot of things that are wrong. And what do they get for it? They are treated like a skunk at a picnic. They are targeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this legislation we put before us would provide the new center with the independence and authority to promptly identify serious safety risks and take necessary actions to protect the public, and I hope eliminate some of the intimidation against whistleblowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, the intra-agency communication is essential in addressing drug safety. So this legislation would encourage communication between the center and other centers and offices, or let's say subagencies at the Food and Drug Administration that handle drugs and biological products, to do what is best for the consumer and not have big PhRMA having undue influence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second bill we are introducing would expand an existing Web site, www.clinicaltrials.gov, to create a publicly accessible national databank of clinical trial information. The databank would be comprised of a clinical trial registry and a clinical trial results database of all publicly and privately funded clinical trials so that everything is out there for the public to consider, not letting somebody choose: Well, if this is a little negative toward our drug, we will not make that public.  All the positive stuff, of course, we will make public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think this legislation is going to foster transparency. But it is going to bring about a great deal of accountability in health research and development and ensure that the scientific community and, most importantly, the general public whom we are trying to protect have access to basic information about clinical trials, about new drugs going out on the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also create an environment that would encourage companies from withholding clinically important information about their products from the Food and Drug Administration and from the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, the information that is coming out now about Vioxx in the newspapers today will even tell you that a long time before Vioxx went on the market there were scientists within the company who were raising questions about whether it was going to cause harm to the heart. All of this information should be out there. The public ought to know it. Your doctor ought to know it. Transparency and accountability should not hurt anybody in an open society such as we have in  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="1455">S1455</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we have learned anything over the last few years, it is that the Food and Drug Administration is a troubled agency that lost sight of its fundamental function. That fundamental function is to protect the safety and the efficacy of new prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two very important things for them to answer: Are the drugs safe for you? Are they effective?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the public has good reason to doubt the Food and Drug Administration's ability to do its job. And experts from all over the country have expressed concern. These two bills, then, that Senator Dodd and I are introducing--and let me parenthetically say for the public, people are always thinking that Democrats are hitting on Republicans and Republicans are hitting on Democrats. There is a lot going on around here you never see on evening television that is bipartisan because  there is not controversy about it, or at least there is no controversy between Republicans and Democrats. But what they want to put in the news media every night is when some Republican is fighting some Democrat. So our constituents get a view about this Congress that is very distorted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to have people read on a regular basis about how Senator Baucus and I meet on a regular basis to determine the agenda for the Finance Committee. I would like to have them read about how he and I have put out bipartisan bills for the last 6 years--whether he was chairman or I was chairman--and that every one of them got to the President to be signed. But you do not hear those things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to emphasize, this is a DODD--and Senator Dodd is a Democrat from Connecticut--and a GRASSLEY bill--and GRASSLEY is a Republican Senator from Iowa. So this bill is being introduced to ensure the safety and efficacy of new prescription drugs, not to do something new for the FDA, just to give them the tools to do what they have had a responsibility to do for several decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the public has doubts about the FDA's ability to do it. These two bills will help put the FDA back on the path to fulfilling its mission and, most importantly, put the American consumer first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that my statement in the Record that I give today be coupled with the statement of Senator Dodd, which will be given later today, regarding the introduction of these important bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By giving me this unanimous consent, it will assure the public, when they read about these bills, knows that DODD is a Democrat, GRASSLEY is a Republican, and they are bipartisan bills.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 469. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the special rule for contributions of qualified conservation contributions; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="469">S. 469</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Heritage Conservation Extension Act of 2007, along with my good friend Senator Grassley from Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the country, and my home State of Montana, are losing precious agricultural and ranch lands at a record pace. While providing Montana and the Nation with the highest quality food and fiber, these farms and ranches also provide habitat for wildlife and the open spaces, land that many of us take for granted and assume will always be there. Montana has begun to recognize the importance of these lands. We currently have 1,573,411 acres covered by conservation easements. To some, that  may seem like a large amount, but this is Montana, a State that covers 93,583,532 acres, making the conservation easements coverage a mere 1.68 percent of all of our lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future generations, we must help our hardworking farmers and ranchers preserve this precious heritage and their way-of-life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conservation easements have been tremendously successful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. Last year, the Congress recognized this by providing targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation easement. The provision allows eligible farmers and ranchers to increase the amounts of deduction that may be taken currently for charitable contributions of qualified conservation easements by raising the Adjusted  Gross Income (AGI) limitations to 100 percent and extending the carryover period from 5 years to 15 years. In the case of all landowners, the AGI limitation would be raised from 30 percent to 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rural Heritage Conservation Extension Act of 2007 would make this allowable deduction permanent, building on the success of conservation easements. Our farmers and ranchers will be able to preserve their important agricultural and ranching lands for future generations, while continuing to operate their businesses. Landowners, conservationists, the Federal Government, and local communities are working together to preserve our precious natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is vitally important to Montana, and to every other State in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
