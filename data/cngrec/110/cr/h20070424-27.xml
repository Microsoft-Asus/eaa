    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as President Bush said yesterday, this is a tough time in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week our Congress will hear from our commander in Baghdad, General David Petraeus, here on Capitol Hill. I suspect we will hear what I heard from General Petraeus on the streets of Baghdad just 3 weeks ago. That is, despite a wave of recent insurgent bombing, this war is not lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, because of the President's surge and the brave conduct of our forces and the Iraqi forces, we are making modest progress in Iraq. In Baghdad, despite recent bombings, sectarian violence is down. Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer because of the presence of more than two dozen U.S. and Iraqi joint operating centers, and now more than 20 Sunni sheiks across the Al Anbar Province have united together to oppose the insurgency and al Qaeda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly believe that we are making progress because of the President's surge. This war is not lost. The American people know in their hearts that victory is our only option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's give General Petraeus a willing ear, the time and the resources and the authority to secure a victory for freedom in Iraq, for ourselves and our posterity.</paragraph>
