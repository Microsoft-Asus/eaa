    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is a very special day. Today, October 2, marks the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. To honor him, the United Nations approved a resolution that, beginning today, designates October 2 as International Day of Nonviolence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a start, one that was inspired by Sonia Gandhi after she successfully led an international conference called "Peace, Nonviolence and Empowerment--Gandhian Philosophy in the 21st Century." There is a yearning for peace, for an end to world hunger and poverty, and a world in which peace and justice for all is not a dream but a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gandhi showed us the way. He said: "Nonviolence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart, and it must be an inseparable part of our being."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gandhi's philosophy is a legacy he left to benefit the whole world. It is up to us to preserve this great gift. And I will do my part. I have introduced House Resolution 653 to express the sense of the Congress that the concept of nonviolence and the teaching of Gandhi remain relevant in this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Gandhi himself said: "Nonviolence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.N. resolution itself shows Gandhi's remarkable ability to change the world. A record 143 nations co-sponsored the U.N. resolution, Gandhi uniting us again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us resolve to honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to Gandhi's philosophy of peace through nonviolence. It is the only path to true peace in the world.</paragraph>
