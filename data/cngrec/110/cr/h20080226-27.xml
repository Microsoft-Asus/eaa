    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush and congressiona l Republicans are playing politics with our national security. They're falsely claiming that the expiration of a temporary provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is endangering America and compromising our national security. If that is indeed the case, why did the President threaten to veto any extension of his own law? And why did every House Republican vote against a 21-day extension of the law earlier this month?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the expiration of this law would, indeed, endanger the American publi c as Republicans suggest, wouldn't House Republicans do everything in their power to actually keep the law in place? And despite all this fearmongering, House Republicans know that all of our electronic surveillance capabilities are still in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the White House and congressional Republicans play games with our national security, congressional Democrats will continue to work to pass a final FISA bill that will give our intelligence community the tool it needs to protect our Nation w hile we also protect our citizens' civil liberties.</paragraph>
