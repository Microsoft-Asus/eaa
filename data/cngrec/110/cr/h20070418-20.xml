    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the battle of ideas is alive and well here in the House of Representatives where we have two different parties with two different philosophies; and nowhere is that more clear than in the budget debate that is occurring today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the budget that passed the House before the Easter recess, the majority passed the largest tax increase in American history. I just held 34 town hall meetings in my First Congressional District of Wisconsin, and my constituents are telling me they don't want to see the per-child tax credit get cut in half. They don't want to see the marriage penalty come back. They don't want to see income tax rates raised across the board. They don't want to see the death tax come back in full force.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H3484]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax cuts that passed in 2001 and 2003 created 7.6 million new jobs. We don't need tax increases; but, unfortunately, the budget that the majority passed here does just that. It gets rid of all of that tax relief that created all of these jobs, and it gives the American people the largest tax increase in American history. I think it is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We on this side of the aisle, the minority, we believe in a different path: Balance the budget by controlling spending and keep taxes low. That's the way to go, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
