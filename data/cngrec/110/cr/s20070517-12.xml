    <paragraph>I congratulate Senator Conrad, the chairman of  the Budget Committee, who has done an absolutely masterful job in charting the boat of the Budget Committee through considerably hazardous waters, to be able to end up with a vote like he did today, 52 to 40, in the passage of the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a budget that clearly is trying to accommodate enormous spending that we have to do for the defense establishment, for the national security needs of this country, and at the same time, to attack the issue of how we are going to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is, there are certain taxes we recognize we are going to have to do something about, because if we don't, it is going to hit the middle class. We have to do something about the 10-percent level for the lower income group. We have to do something about the child tax credit. Since all of them are tax cuts, it is going to cost revenue. We even have to tackle the issue of the estate tax, trying to craft a compromise which in this bill allows for then the Finance Committee to approach  an exemption of $3.5 million per person of the estate tax and then reduce the tax rate from 55 to 45 percent that the balance of the estate would be taxed. That would protect the family farms, the family businesses, the vast majority of them in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I compliment the Senator from North Dakota, who has had to be so dextrous and so insightful. Every little jot and tittle, every nuance he has had to attend to. It is a real confirmation of his ability that he gets a resounding vote as he did today on passage of the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
