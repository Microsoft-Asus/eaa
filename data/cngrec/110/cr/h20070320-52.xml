    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Mr. Larry Carroll on 30 years of outstanding service with the Permian Basin Community Centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Carroll represents the model public citizen. He has served the Permian Basin Community Center as director of finance, deputy executive director, and now as the center's executive director. I served on and chaired the board of directors for the PBCC and know Mr. Carroll to be one of the finest, most capable executive directors in the community center system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is his commitment, dedication and wisdom that has helped develop the center into one of the most outstanding community organizations the Permian Basin has to offer. Mr. Carroll has made a personal commitment to helping others through his additional valued work with the Rotary Club and Leadership Odessa, and I am proud to represent my friend in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 11th District of Texas congratulates and graciously thanks Mr. Carroll for this milestone and his exemplary service to the community.</paragraph>
