  <narrative>ORDER OF PROCEDURE -- (Senate - May 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4742">S4742</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to ask for consent, in a few minutes, to have the override of the farm bill occur at 2 o'clock today. Senator Gregg will have 15 minutes, Senator Chambliss and Senator Harkin will have 15 minutes divided between them, a total of 30 minutes. That debate will take place before 2 o'clock, and at 2 o'clock we will vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also inform all Members we still don't have particulars resolved on the budget. There are a number of alternatives. We can't do anything on it until we get the legislation from the House. They are going to take that up sometime this afternoon. As I said, the alternatives are, when it gets here we run out--I think there was at least a gentleman's agreement, although not on the record, that the 4 hours we used yesterday would run against the 10 hours, so we would have 6 hours to complete that  today. We would vote sometime this evening on that. That is one alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other alternative is to consider all talking over with. I am sure we need to hear more on the budget, but that would be one alternative. We could come back after the recess at a time--when a vote is this close I think I need authority to determine when the vote would take place, but we would have 15 minutes of debate on that, and then we would vote on the budget. So that is what we are working on. We do not have it done yet.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Is the Senator suggesting we do the farm bill around 2?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes. I say to my distinguished colleague, counterpart, we would complete the debate on that and that debate would be 15 minutes with Senator Gregg, 15 minutes divided between Senators Harkin and Chambliss, a total of 30 minutes. We would do that in the next hour and 10 minutes and then vote at 2 o'clock.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>That would be the last vote prior to--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>That, I say to my friend, we don't have resolved yet. We have to work out the time on the budget. I think, even though it is early Thursday and we are used to working late on Thursday and most all day Friday, we could make an exception and try to get out somewhat early on Thursday. But we have to work that out with you folks, as to how we would do the time. We could ask for a show of hands, asking if we want to finish, if we should have the vote tonight. I don't think the show of hands  would be helpful to what I wish to accomplish. So we are going to try to do the second alternative, use all the time; when we come back, we will have a time certain--not a time certain but fairly certain--and we will try to have it on Monday or Tuesday when we get back, to have a vote on passage of the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, when the Senate considers the conference report to accompany <bill type="sc" number="70">S. Con. Res. 70</bill>, the budget resolution--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Can we have order in the Chamber, please. The majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to offer two unanimous consent requests. If they are both approved, then we will have no more votes today, other than the one on the override of the President's veto on the farm bill.</paragraph>
