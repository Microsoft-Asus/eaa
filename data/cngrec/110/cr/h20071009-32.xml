  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="651">H. Res. 651</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas following the oil shock of the early 1970s, Brazil chose to reduce its energy vulnerability by choosing sugar-based ethanol to diversify its energy sector and power its automobiles;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas with large private and public investments and support from the World Bank, Brazil greatly expanded the amount of sugarcane it produced and began large-scale construction of alcohol distilleries to process sugar into ethanol;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas decades of state investment have helped Brazil become the world's largest consumer and producer of ethanol from sugar cane;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas ethanol supplies 40 percent of the motor fuel used in Brazil and is extremely competitive with gasoline;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the transition towards biofuels will have a positive impact on the environment and will help reduce greenhouse gases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas by the end of 2006, 80 percent of new car sales in Brazil were flex-fuel, meaning that they can run on ethanol, gasoline, or any mixture of both;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Brazil stands out as the leading example of a country that has diversified its energy supply and become a net exporter of energy, in large part by increasing its use and production of alternative energy sources, including ethanol;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas putting the United States on a path toward ending its addiction to oil, as Brazil has done, by investing in clean alternative energy sources is essential in protecting United States national security, the environment, and the stability of the United States economy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on March 9, 2007, the United States and Brazil--the world's two largest ethanol producing countries--signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to promote greater cooperation on ethanol and biofuels in the Western Hemisphere;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States-Brazil MOU involves technology-sharing between the United States and Brazil, feasibility studies and technical assistance to build domestic biofuels industries in third countries, and multilateral efforts to advance the global development of biofuels;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the first countries targeted for United States-Brazilian technical assistance are the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas United States President George W. Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva have met twice in 2007 as visible examples of the expanding warm relations and close ties between the United States and Brazil;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States and Brazil are the two largest and most diverse democracies in the Western Hemisphere;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Brazil--through its leadership of the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) in Haiti and other achievements--has emerged as a regional leader in the Western Hemisphere; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that the United States looks to Brazil as a "regional leader and a global partner": Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes that the United States and Brazil have arrived at the point of a strategic confluence of interests and urges President George W. Bush to continue to deepen the bilateral relationship between the two countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes Brazil's role as a leader in the Western Hemisphere and commends its leadership of the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) in Haiti;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) commends Brazil for successfully diversifying its energy resources and reducing its dependence on oil;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) strongly supports the March 9, 2007, United States-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on biofuels as a major step forward in bilateral relations, hemispheric integration, and energy diversification;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) commends joint efforts by the United States and Brazil for their commitment to use expertise to provide technical assistance for biofuels industries in third countries, currently including the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (6) encourages United States and Brazilian officials to quickly identify additional countries in the Western Hemisphere to receive technical assistance related to biofuels.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would first like to thank our colleagues, Congressman ELIOT ENGEL and DAN BURTON, for introducing this important resolution. Their leadership on Brazil-related matters is greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Brazil has the largest economy, population, and land mass in South America. It is the fifth most populous country in the world, and its economy is the 11th largest. It is high time we recognize, as this resolution does, the expanding strategic relationship between the United States and Brazil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in America are finally waking up not only to Brazil's importance, but to how natural this relationship should be. Brazil is also the right country with which to cooperate on alternative energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution commends Brazil on successfully reducing its dependence on oil by finding alternative ways to satisfy its energy needs and recognizes the importance of the March 9, 2007, U.S.-Brazil memorandum of understanding on biofuels cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agreement promotes greater cooperation on ethanol and biofuels between the world's two largest ethanol-producing countries. Brazil has become the world's largest consumer and producer of ethanol from sugar cane. By the end of 2006, 80 percent of new-car sales in Brazil were flex-fuel, meaning they can run on a mixture of ethanol and gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, ethanol supplies 40 percent of the motor fuel used in Brazil and is extremely competitive with gasoline. We as Americans can learn a great deal from Brazil and they from us as we try to reduce their dependence on oil and diversify our energy resources. The U.S. and Brazil are providing technical assistance to build biofuels industries in Third World countries, including the Dominican Republic, Haiti, El Salvador, St. Kitts, and Nevis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that Brazil, through its leadership of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and other achievements, has emerged as a regional leader in the Western Hemisphere, a role this resolution recognizes for Brazil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brazil's leadership in the Americas and throughout the world signals the emergence of a vital partner and friend to the United States. That is why I  strongly urge all Members to support this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, early this year, the U.S. and Brazil signed a memorandum of understanding on biofuels cooperation. This document symbolizes not only a shared interest in reducing energy vulnerability, but also a growing relationship between our two countries based on the common goal of regional stability and prosperity throughout the Western Hemisphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to learn of the progress made under the United States-Brazil memorandum of understanding and applaud the proactive efforts being taken by both of our countries in confronting the constraints of oil dependence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Hugo Chavez continues to exploit Venezuela's oil supply to spread his propaganda across the Western Hemisphere, it is essential that the U.S. and Brazil continue to lead the way in diminishing our historical dependence on oil by finding alternative ways to satisfy our energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, while I appreciate the growing and valuable role of Brazil as a strategic partner, we must remain vigilant of Brazil's own activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the U.S. continues to work to promote freedom and democracy in the hemisphere, we continue to face challenges by the likes of Venezuela's Chavez and Bolivia's Morales, under the tyrannical influences of Castro.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must be cognizant of the fact that President da Silva was in fact a founding member of the Foro de Sao Paolo, which plays host to these men and promoter to their increasingly anti-American rhetoric throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brazil has a history of noncompliance with the IAEA obligations and an expressed interest in pursuing future enrichment programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This mixed with the increasing of rogue regimes, like Iran and Syria, to make inroads into the unstable political, economic and social worlds of Latin America requires the U.S. be vigilant in our assessment of Brazil and the region as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As biofuels cooperation allows our two countries to work increasingly closely together, I am hopeful that continued success in bilateral relations, hemispheric integration, and energy diversification will help to mitigate these challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her leadership and my good friend and colleague Mr. Bilirakis for their support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me commend Congressman Engel and Congressman Burton, both chairman and ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs, and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Lantos, and the ranking member of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important step that cements and further enhances the relationship between Brazil and the United States, the largest economy, population land mass in South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it's even more important to reinforce the strategic relationship that we are establishing between Brazil and the United States, the friendship that we are establishing, and to have both countries wake up to the importance of our relationship to each other and for it to be a natural relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brazil is also the right country in which to cooperate with alternative energy sources. It has an enormously diverse population and a very large Afro-Brazilian population. In fact, it is the largest African population in South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that as we move forward on this legislation that we emphasize the successful relationship between Brazil and the United States as we work towards alternative fuels. This is a good partnership. It is a good legislative initiative, and I congratulate the sponsors and look forward to working with them on expanding our relationship between the United States and Brazil.</paragraph>
