    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in honor of Veterans Day I rise to recognize a special group of veterans whose story and service this Congress must honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, thousands of Filipino soldiers were inducted into the United States Armed Forces by President Roosevelt following the invasion of their country by Imperial Japanese Forces. These Filipino soldiers fought valiantly with us in the name of freedom. They were to be entitled to full veterans benefits, but such promises were reneged by Congress with the passage of the 1946 Rescission Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, the very democracy that these veterans fought to defend was used to take away the recognition of their service. We have a duty to fulfill what President Truman called a "moral obligation" to take care of these veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 18,000 still with us today. Let us make this right. Support the Filipino Veterans Equity Act.</paragraph>
