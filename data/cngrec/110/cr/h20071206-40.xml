    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, have you seen the news? Democrat inaction on the alternative minimum tax is leading to a delay of tax refunds for millions of hardworking Americans. The carelessness of this new majority is poised again to strike the American people, this time in their wallet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This AMT problem's been known for months. Yet we still have no action in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average tax refund last year was more than $2,000, $2,000, Mr. Speaker. That's a mortgage payment. That's college tuition. That's a holiday credit card bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the new majority has made clear that, in good faith, they support policies to raise taxes, this expensive predicament with the AMT is simply the result of congressional negligence. Now, the American people expect more than this from Congress. They want less partisanship and more leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's act now to ensure the American people are not forced to pick up the tab for the carelessness of this majority. Let's put politics aside and put hardworking taxpayers first.</paragraph>
