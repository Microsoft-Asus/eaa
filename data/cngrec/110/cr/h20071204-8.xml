    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of a terrific Member, former Congressman Henry Hyde. He's often recognized for his wisdom and his eloquence of speaking. But, frankly, there were some other sides of him that were very precious. He was a man of quick wit and a keen sense of humor, to which I was always a willing audience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, he was passionately committed to protecting and improving the lives of Americans, all Americans, both born and the unborn. He was an effective pro-life advocate, through prohibiting Federal funding of abortions with the Hyde amendment and his advocacy for the ban on partial-birth abortions. Conservative estimates indicate that there are about 2 million Americans alive today as a direct result of his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Hyde leaves behind a legacy that inspires and challenges those of us who remain behind today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My deepest condolences and sympathy to his family, and may God bless Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
