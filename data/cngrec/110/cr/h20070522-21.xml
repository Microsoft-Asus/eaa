  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the first 4 months of this year, the new Democratic-led House approved key legislation that will move us in a new direction and allow us better defense of our Nation and strengthen our military. Unfortunately, time and time again, the President has either vetoed our efforts or has threatened to veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our first 100 hours, we passed a bill implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, including improvements in securing our ports, our border and our infrastructure. The administration currently opposes this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House also approved the Rail and Mass Transit Security Act, which requires the Homeland Security Department to develop plans to protect our rail and mass transit. Despite strong bipartisan support here in the House, President Bush has threatened to veto it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, protecting our homeland is not a partisan issue. This House approved both of these critical homeland security bills with the votes of both Republicans and Democrats. I would hope the President would stop being an obstructionist and instead support our important bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
