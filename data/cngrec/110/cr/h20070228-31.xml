    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, lest the American people be deceived, the House is finished for today; 2:15 this afternoon, 4 hours and 15 minutes. Yesterday we were in session for less than an hour. Monday we weren't in session at all. This week, 5 hours and 15 minutes. That is less than 2 hours a day, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Orwellian democracy is alive and well here in Washington, but just because the Democrats say that we are working 5 days a week doesn't make it so. This kind of disinformation does a disservice to our entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrat broken promises are piling up, Madam Speaker, and the American people are paying attention.</paragraph>
