    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for <bill type="s" number="976">S. 976</bill>, the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2007, which my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Obama, and I introduced on March 23, 2007. Senator Obama introduced this legislation last year. We have worked together on some revisions, and I am proud to join him in cosponsoring the legislation this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this legislation will help improve the quality and safety of health care by providing a better understanding of what causes certain diseases. Through a coordinated research initiative and safer genetic tests, patients and doctors will be empowered to make more informed decisions about medical treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will advance the study of human genes and their functions to better predict patients' susceptibility to certain diseases or conditions and better customize drugs and medical treatments to meet patients' unique needs. By facilitating genomics research, fostering a capable genomics workforce, and encouraging the development of high quality genetic tests, patients will be better informed about the medical care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that North Carolina is a leader in genomics and personalized medicine research. Duke University's Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Institute for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy are both conducting significant research efforts in this area and support a stronger Federal focus on genomics. This legislation will increase Federal support for initiatives at Duke and Chapel Hill--a win-win for North Carolina and patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill establishes an Interagency Working Group at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pull together and accelerate genomics research by developing standardized terminology and establishing quality standards and guidelines for the collection, processing, and storage of genomic samples and data. It advances genomics research by establishing a national biobanking distributed database that collects and integrates genomic data to simplify pooled data analysis. The  bill also develops biobanking initiatives at academic medical centers across the country, including biobanks containing biological specimens. It will improve genetics and genomics training by developing model training programs, residency curricula and teaching materials, and by integrating genetics and genomics into clinical and public health practice by developing health professional guidelines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also encourage drug sponsors and device companies to develop companion diagnostic tests, and it will improve Federal oversight and regulation of genetic tests by identifying which tests require review and which agency--the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the Food and Drug Administration--should have oversight over specific categories of tests. It requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic tests to which  consumers have direct access and to educate the public about genomics and its applications. It also asks the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to assess the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of companion diagnostic tests that guide prescribing decisions.</paragraph>
