    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey), in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill> which names the postal facility in Bremen, Georgia, after a fallen hero, Sergeant Paul Saylor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Introduced on May 20, 2008, <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill> is sponsored by Congressman Phil Gingrey, representative of Georgia's 11th Congressional District and cosponsored by the entire Georgia delegation and a total of 43 Members of Congress. <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a native of Norcross, Georgia, Sergeant Paul Saylor lost his life while serving in Iraq. According to military records, Sergeant Saylor was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 108th Armor Regiment from the Georgia Army National Guard out of Calhoun, Georgia, when he was killed on August 15 as a result of his Humvee accidentally rolling over into a canal in Mahmudiyah, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Described as a good-hearted, very dedicated and hardworking gentleman, Sergeant Saylor served his country proudly and with distinction. In honor of sacrifice, Mr. Speaker, let us also pay tribute to the life of Sergeant Saylor and pass <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill> and designate the Tallapoosa Street post office building in Bremen, Georgia, after this fine American soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey), the author of <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Turner), the ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding. I also, Mr. Speaker, want to thank my good friend from Illinois, Representative Davis, for the kind words that he just expressed toward Sergeant Paul Saylor and for allowing this bill to come forward today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill>, a bill that I introduced to honor the life of Paul Anthony Saylor by designating the post office in Bremen, Georgia, in Haralson County, as the Sergeant Paul Saylor Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thankfully we are at a point today where the Iraqi Government is proving to be more and more capable of securing its country and where al Qaeda terrorists are on the verge of being completely routed. But we can all agree that the road on which we have traveled has been anything but smooth. Indeed, we have lost 4,166 of our Nation's greatest treasures in Iraq, the lives of the patriotic, heroic men and women who have served there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are not just statistics, Mr. Speaker. There is a story behind each and every one of the brave men and women who have died serving our country in this global war on terror. I have come to know Paul's story very well over the last 3 years. You have heard the stories of other fallen heroes today who are being honored in the same way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Saylor's story is indeed one of courage, kindness, generosity, and devotion to his family and to his great country. Paul was a beloved son to his parents, Jamie and Patti; a beloved brother to Little Jamie, his big brother; and a beloved nephew to Linda Kirkland. He enjoyed playing high school football with his older brother, and was known for his smile and his caring heart. My colleagues, I want you to look at Paul Saylor in this poster. He is, indeed, a kind young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Paul's death, many have spoken of his penchant for standing up for others who were being bullied, for picking people up when they were down. It is a testament to the affection that others had for Paul that of the 5,000 citizens of Bremen, Georgia, his hometown, over 1,500 attended his funeral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was Paul's sense of duty that led him to join the Georgia National Guard following his attendance at North Georgia College and State University. Upon joining, Paul probably had no idea he would be called upon to defend his country and our freedom in Iraq, but when he was, he bravely answered that call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served our Nation in Iraq as a member of the Georgia National Guard's 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Paul lost his life on August 15, 2005, almost 3 years ago, while on patrol in Al Mahmudiyah, Iraq, when the vehicle in which he was traveling rolled down an embankment into a canal. He and two of his fellow scout team members died that day. Paul was 21 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mr. Speaker, upon being returned to his family, Paul's remains were in a state of advanced decomposition and they were not able to see him that one last time for the final good-bye.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>His family has worked tirelessly since then to assure that the improved treatment of the remains of all fallen soldiers would ensure that no family, no family would ever have to experience a similar fate of not being able to view their son or daughter one last time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I worked with Paul's family to address any potential shortfalls in our mortuary process, I have visited the mortuary facility at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, as well as Mortuary Affairs Collection Point in Iraq, exactly where Paul fell, to try to evaluate the current processes and the procedures and identify any areas where improvements could be made. And those efforts led eventually to the inclusion of a provision last year in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007  requiring that all medical personnel be thoroughly trained not only in saving lives but also in remains preservation before they are deployed into the theater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This training is currently being carried out in the medical training facilities at Fort Sam Houston and the Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. On a recent visit last month, I was able to determine that the Army is solemnly carrying out this duty, and I am proud to report that to my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we could never do enough to support and honor Paul's sacrifice, it is the least we can do to ensure that we honor the remains of our fallen heroes with the dignity and respect that they deserve. Our Nation will be forever indebted to Sergeant Paul Saylor. I know he is here with us today, and I would like to say to him, Thank you, Paul. Thank you for your service. And I want to thank his family. Paul, your spirit lives on, and you will never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me today in honoring Sergeant Paul Saylor. Vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="6092">H.R. 6092</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 101 Tallapoosa Street in Bremen, Georgia, as the "Sergeant Paul Saylor Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Friendly. Dedicated. Hardworking. These are but a few of the magnificent words of praise that arise when friends and family speak of the memory of Sergeant Paul Saylor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Bremen, Georgia, Paul was a shining star in his community. A starter on the football team and committed thespian, Paul was voted "best personality" by his graduating class of 2002. After graduation, Paul attended North Georgia College and State University, a military college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, on August 15, 2005, Sergeant Saylor lost his life while serving as part of the National Guard's 48th Infantry in Al Mahmudiyah, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Described by his brother, Jamie, as the "......type who would help you, but he wouldn't let you know it," Sergeant Saylor served his family, community, and country with selfless devotion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in honor of not only a tremendous patriot, but an outstanding citizen. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution in honor of a valiant life that should not, and will not, soon be forgotten by a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
