    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Thrivent Aid for Lutherans for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects their hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role they have played in giving back to their local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thrivent Aid for Lutherans is partnered with the Brookings Area Habitat for Humanity. With the support of innumerable meals and volunteer support, Thrivent, as well as all Lutheran churches in Brookings, has been responsible for great gains in Habitat goals. They have even enlisted the support of Lutheran churches outside of the county. Over the past year, two homes were funded and constructed using Thrivent resources. This continued support has greatly expanded the success of the Brookings Area  Habitat for Humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Thrivent Aid for Lutherans and to congratulate them on receiving this well-earned award and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
