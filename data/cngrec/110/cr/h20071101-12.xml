    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend an outstanding student athlete, Daniel Jacob Woodhead, senior tailback for the Chadron State College Eagles, who shattered the NCAA all-division record for career rushing yards on October 6, 2007. On that day, Danny carried the ball 34 times for 208 yards, bringing his career rushing total to 7,441 yards, and has added 114 yards since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also holds the NCAA all-division record for most rushing yards in a season at 2,756 in 2006 and has 19 games in which he gained 200 yards rushing or more, a record in itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Danny is a First Team Academic All-American, a consensus All-American, and recipient of the Harlon Hill Trophy, awarded to the outstanding player of the year in NCAA Division II football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Daniel Jacob Woodhead who, through his outstanding achievements of distinction, has brought great honor to himself, his family, his coaches and teammates, Eagles fans, Chadron State College, and the State of Nebraska.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
