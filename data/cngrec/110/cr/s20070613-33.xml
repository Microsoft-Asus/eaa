    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize Lake Norden, SD. The town of Lake Norden will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Hamlin County, Lake Norden is home to the South Dakota Amateur Baseball Hall of Fame, the Lake Norden Historical Society Museum, and the Donald Christman Toy Museum. Lake Norden has been a successful and thriving community for the past 100 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Lake Norden on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
