    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in morning business to speak about the passing of an extraordinary man. Today, in Baton Rouge, in the capital, the son of a sharecropper will lie in state. It is a fitting tribute to Coach Eddie Robinson, the winningest  coach in the history of football, but a man who excelled beyond the playing field, a man whose life touched hundreds and thousands of athletes, on the field and off, and millions of lives in a  positive way around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to pay him tribute today. He is a true American hero. He began coaching in 1941 at Grambling State University. During his 57-year coaching tenure, he won more than 400 football games--more than any other coach before him--and 17 championships in the Southwestern Athletic Conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Robinson shattered the glass ceiling that had always held back the true potential of African-American players and coaches. He did it with a strong and indomitable spirit and with determination and love of country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a time before the civil rights movement, when overt and state-sponsored racism was the order of the day and permeated both college and professional sports, Coach Robinson proved that all athletes deserve to compete on the same playing field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the years, more than 200 of his players have played in the NFL, including Paul "Tank" Younger, the first NFL player from a predominantly African-American college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Robinson was personally responsible for paving the way for hundreds of African-American players to have the opportunity to play in the NFL and, as well, to play in majority White colleges and universities throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His legacy includes one of the most exciting annual matchups in college sports held every year: the Thanksgiving Bayou Classic football game, held usually in New Orleans, LA, between Grambling State, his beloved university, and Southern University of Baton Rouge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But his achievements are not limited to his athletic victories. He taught the players the meaning of teamwork and patriotism, self-respect and hard work. He provided them with real lessons of life that extended far beyond the playing field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After their experience at Grambling, I know how proud he was to see his young athletes excel and move all over the world, impacting the wider community in business and in athletics, as well as in general community service in multiple ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He leaves behind a vibrant legacy. He leaves behind a legacy of mentorship that is truly unmatched. He leaves behind a loving and wonderful family, a faith that permeated his entire life and had impact throughout the community. He leaves behind a life well lived and a model for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of his former players said it best when he said: "Everyone wanted to be like Eddie."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I close these remarks today by saying that I, like most everyone in Louisiana, knew Coach Robinson. We had been in his presence. We had watched him coach. We had heard him laugh. I had the great privilege of spending some time with him recently at his home in Grambling, with his wife Doris and some of the family members. I could not help to be, even at his late age of 88, impressed with his strong and wonderful spirit. When he was just a few years younger, as he walked into the  room, you could feel that spirit immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is with great sadness that we say good-bye to Coach Eddie Robinson. But it is with great joy we share with the world this man, the son of a sharecropper, a man who refused to let the limits of even the laws of those times and the limits of the culture in which he lived to stop him or to stop his belief in the young men and women he coached and served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we say good-bye today. But he is getting a proper tribute lying in state at our State capital in Baton Rouge, and we are confident his legacy will live on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my last visit with his family, I hoped and suggested we could build a museum in his honor. I am hoping it is something in which Members of this Congress will join with our leaders at home--not just any museum but a museum that will honor his life and legacy; a place where athletes, professional and amateur, could receive ongoing training and support both scholastically as well as in terms of general leadership, so his legacy could live on. Perhaps this place or the center of learning and leadership  should be located either on or somewhere very near the Grambling campus where he served for so many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, it is with great sadness we say good-bye, but with great pride in a true American hero, Eddie Robinson.</paragraph>
