    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to remember former Member of the House of Representatives Augustus Hawkins, who passed away on November 10, 2007, at the age of 100.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Augustus Freeman Hawkins was the first African American from California to be elected to Congress. He was a champion of workers, fair housing, and civil rights, and Hawkins represented south Los Angeles, first in the State legislature and then in Congress, for more than half a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Augustus was born in Shreveport, LA, on Aug. 31, 1907, the youngest of five children of Nyanza and Hattie Helena Hawkins. His family arrived in Los Angeles soon after World War I when Hawkins was 11. He attended Jefferson High School and earned a degree from UCLA in 1931.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He began his public service career in an era that was far less congenial to minority politicians, serving as a State assemblyman from 1935 until 1962, when he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, as the civil rights movement was taking center stage. He served in the House from 1963 to 1991, and I was proud to serve with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While soft-spoken, Hawkins was fiery in defense of his constituents. At the time of the 1965 Watts riots in his district, he declared that police had been "abusive and arrogant and have attempted to control things by force, not by more modern methods of control."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Hawkins retired at 83, he was widely praised for his unflagging legislative efforts to help bring those who had been left out of the system into the mainstream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His legislative legacy includes a key role in shaping Federal statutes, most importantly as sponsor of the section of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act that created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hawkins fought with President after President for minimum-wage increases and, with Senator Hubert Humphrey, wrote the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 that was designed to reduce unemployment and inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is survived by two stepdaughters, Barbara A. Hammond and Brenda L. Stevenson; a stepson, Michael A. Taylor; two grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation lost an amazing public servant and mentor with the passing of Augustus Freeman Hawkins, but his legacy to the people of south Los Angeles, the State of California, and all of America should be remembered.</paragraph>
