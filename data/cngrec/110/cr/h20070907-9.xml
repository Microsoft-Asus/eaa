  <narrative>AMERICA WANTS A NEW DIRECTION ON IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10248]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the previous days have offered a series of reports on conditions in Iraq. These reports have been consistent: Iraq remains dangerous, unstable, and political progress is virtually nonexistent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't supposed to be this way. The President's escalation was supposed to give the Iraqi Government and the ethnic groups the room they needed to make political progress. That progress simply has not happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now, after 4 1/2  years, billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and countless new slogans, the Bush administration is just giving us the status quo. Instead of a new strategy for Iraq, the Bush administration is cherry-picking the data to support the political objectives and preparing a report that will offer yet another defense of the President's strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need a report that wins a Nobel Prize for creative statistics or the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Americans are demanding the facts, an end to this open-ended commitment, a surge on the political and diplomatic front. In short, the American people want a new direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
