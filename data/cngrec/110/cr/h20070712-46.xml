  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to correct the record concerning a great economist and friend, the late Dr. Bernard Siegan, a distinguished professor of law at the University of San Diego. In 1988 Dr. Siegan was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals. He promptly came under personal attack, most notably from Professor Lawrence Tribe of Harvard University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tribe wrote a public letter on May 28, 1987, to Senator Joseph Biden belittling Dr. Siegan as being outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence. Tribe further asserted that Dr. Siegan "reveals himself to be not a judicial conservative but an ideologue of the right, one who would deploy the Constitution in service of a conservative economic philosophy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a widely quoted section of his letter, Professor Tribe assailed Dr. Siegan's support of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling as "a component of the right to travel, a right long secured by the Federal courts," which was, of course, Dr. Siegan's reason for supporting Brown v. Board of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time Professor Tribe claimed that this legal view was "tortured" and part of "Mr. Siegan's radical revisionism." At the conclusion of the letter, Professor Tribe wrote, "The notion that it is a black child's freedom to `travel' onto the school grounds that segregation laws infringed is so bizarre and strained ..... as to bring into question both Mr. Siegan's competence as a constitutional lawyer and his sincerity as a scholar." This type of assault was typical of the attacks which  preceded the defeat of Dr. Siegan's nomination. That was back in 1987. And much has changed since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time that Dr. Siegan died in March of 2006, he had many books and speeches and articles that made him one of the most prolific and respected legal and constitutional scholars on the political right. He is today credited with being a father of the recurrent rejuvenation of property rights theory in law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to Dr. Siegan's defense of his views regarding Brown v. Board of Education, Tribe replied in a letter to Dr. Siegan's wife, and this was September 6, 1991: "I have reconsidered my description of your analysis of Brown v. Board of Education in footnote 10 on page 1379 of the second edition of American Constitutional Law. I agree with your general approach that Brown can be justified by arguing from the `liberty' component of the 14th amendment ..... "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that was a letter sent to Siegan years later by Dr. Tribe and when Dr. Tribe and Dr. Siegan were corresponding. These letters were found by his wife, Shelley. Tribe in that same letter writes: "Although I do not reach the same conclusions you do, the issues you raise are important enough to be worthy of scholarly discussion. I am now in the process of drafting a rather substantial supplement to my treatise summarizing recent developments in constitutional law. In my discussion of the equal  protection clause, I will include a citation to your book that I am sure will please you more than the citation did in the last book."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately for the public reputation of Dr. Siegan, Professor Tribe never did complete the supplement to his treatise, and Dr. Siegan, of course, passed away after that exchange of letters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Siegan wrote to Professor Tribe after discovering these letters and asked Dr. Tribe for information on the planned, but not completed, supplement. She also asked the following question: "In the 19 years since you penned your letter to JOE BIDEN, I wonder if you have reconsidered your comment regarding Bernie's competence as a constitutional lawyer and a serious scholar?" Tribe replied to Mrs. Siegan on September 21, 2006. "Please permit me," he wrote, "to apologize to you here  for the unnecessarily ad hominem character of what I wrote to Senator Biden in May of 1987. To help correct the record, if only posthumously, I am sending a copy of this letter to Senator Biden. Despite the differences in our perspectives," he said, "I came to think of Bernie, just as you write that he thought of me, as a colleague in the profession we both truly love and consider to be one of the noblest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would submit the rest of this statement for the Record and note that Lawrence Tribe has set the Record straight, and now the Record is straight on the great person and great scholar that Dr. Bernard Siegan was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sorry to have caused him, or you, any distress, and am grateful for the opportunity your letter afforded me to set the record straight as best I could at this late date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the correspondence between Professors Bernard Siegan and Lawrence Tribe and the subsequent correspondence between Shelly Siegan and Professor Tribe tell us much about the ugly period of personal attack this country experienced during the judicial nomination hearings of the 1980s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A review of the above cited letters makes it clear that Professor Bernard Siegan was a distinguished and respected scholar and champion of personal liberty and private property. Contrary to assertions made during his nomination hearings in 1987, Professor Bernard Siegan would have made an excellent addition to the Ninth District Circuit Court of Appeals. And now the record is set straight.</paragraph>
