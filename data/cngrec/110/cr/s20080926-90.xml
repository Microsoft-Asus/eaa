    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great joy that today I recognize the 125th anniversary of Liberty Baptist Church located in the northwest Arkansas town of Dutch Mills in Washington County along the historic Butterfield Stagecoach Route.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to its members, Liberty Baptist was built in 1883 by the founding families--Kimbrough, Bryant, Douthit, Fields, Greer, Grisham, Holman, Hodges, McCarty, and Seay--of what was then known as Hermansburg, AR. In fact, Rufus Seay, the husband of Jennie Kimbrough and son-in-law to Thomas Kimbrough, donated the land for the church, and the Kimbrough, McCarty, English, Seay, Holland, Patterson, and Hodges families funded the construction. It was a community effort as the men built the church  and the women provided food and encouragement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While much has changed since Liberty Baptist's doors opened in 1883, the community spirit and spiritual nourishment provided by Liberty Baptist Church remain a foundation for the citizens of Dutch Mills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Liberty Baptist will commemorate its anniversary the week of November 2 through 9 with community events and activities. Although I will be unable to attend the festivities, I want to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations and recognize them on this glorious occasion.</paragraph>
