    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute our men and women in uniform. Every year at this time we gather with our friends and family to celebrate Independence Day and the freedoms we hold dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this year, and every year, when families are missing the presence of a spouse, parent or child or worse, morning the loss of a loved one, we must also pause to remember the sacrifice of our veterans. That's why I'm introducing the Benefit Rating Acceleration for Veteran Entitlements Act, or BRAVE Act, which would make it easier for our most disabled veterans to obtain their benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I'm working with others to initiate a national conversation on how veterans can participate in service corps programs and how those programs can serve our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on the Fourth of July, when we celebrate liberty, we must give special recognition and honor to those who are doing so much and have done so much to protect our freedoms.</paragraph>
