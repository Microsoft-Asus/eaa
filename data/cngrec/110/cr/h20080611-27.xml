  <narrative>STRUGGLING TO FIND JOBS -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5221]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are coming to a moment of truth in a few hours for every Member of the House of Representatives. The truth is that every congressional district across the country, individuals and groups of people are struggling to find jobs in an economy cut down by a senseless, wasteful war, overwhelming energy prices, rising food prices and just bad business fundamentals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People can't find jobs because there aren't enough of them. The truth is 4 million have exhausted their unemployment benefits already and things could get even worse unless we pass the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is the American people elected us to serve them, and the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act will be a test of whether the Members remember who they really work for, the people or Big Oil. We are hours away from a moment of truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote for this bill, <bill type="h" number="5749">H.R. 5749</bill>, because Americans who work every day and lose their job through no fault of their own are entitled to a helping hand from their government.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
