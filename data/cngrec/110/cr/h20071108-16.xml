    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, regardless of how my colleagues choose to characterize it, the new Democratic  Congress has an impressive record of honoring our veterans and our troops. Since taking control of Congress, we have provided real support for our veterans by passing the largest veterans funding increase in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But don't take my word for it, listen to what veterans organizations are saying about our historic veterans funding bills. The American Legion called it "an impressive commitment to this Nation's servicemembers, veterans and their families."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Veterans of Foreign Wars said: "The record funding level acknowledges the deep debt this Nation owes to its defenders and that the care and services provided to them is the ongoing cost of war."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMVETS wrote: "Overall, AMVETS believe these funding levels will ensure VA will be able to serve America's veterans and their families with dignity and compassion."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for most of the year President Bush opposed the investment in America's veterans. This legislation simply would not have been possible without a Democratic Congress and their commitment to our veterans.</paragraph>
