  <narrative>COUNTY TIMBER PAYMENTS: JACKSON COUNTY, OREGON -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2557]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WALDEN of Oregon asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, more than a year ago I warned this Congress in a series of speeches how its failure to reauthorize and fund county timber payments would hurt the counties of Oregon's Second Congressional District, and that even a 1-year extension in last year's emergency supplemental, while helpful, was not enough to stave off dramatic impacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jackson County closed all of its libraries. Some of these libraries now have reopened, but with decreased operating hours at limited locations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During an already difficult economic time, the County has eliminated 117 jobs in roads, parks, human services, public safety and planning. Real services have been cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees have discharged <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, which is a 4-year reauthorization of county timber payments. But the Democratic leadership in this House has yet to schedule it for a vote. Why?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January 15, this bill has been eligible for a vote on the House floor. The leadership has found time to name Post Offices and roads and many other things, but not to schedule this important legislation for a vote and keep the Federal Government's commitment to timbered counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I, once again, call on the leadership to schedule a vote on <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>.</paragraph>
