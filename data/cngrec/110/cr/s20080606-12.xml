  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come before our body today because we are dealing with such an incredibly important issue. It is an issue that is full of technicalities but also a lot of passion, a lot of incredible passion about how we take care of this incredible blessing of a planet we have been given, take care of its climate and its environment and all of the incredible things it does for us, and what we have a responsibility to do in return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a daughter of an Arkansas farmer, I was taught at an early age in life to be a good steward of the land we have been given, to understand there will be future generations who will need it, who will cherish it, and who will learn from it. Today, my husband Steve and I continue to instill those principles in our twin boys through all kinds of different activities, whether it is the Scouts they have participated in, whether it is their athletics, whether it is the fishing and hunting they love  to do, whether it is the canoeing and camping we do on the beautiful rivers of Arkansas in the great outdoors--being together and sharing time, being together and being respectful of this great environment we have been given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the issue of global climate change first came before the Senate, it has become abundantly clear to me and I think to millions of Americans as well as those in this body that we have to take action on this issue if we have any hope of correcting it. We have had our heads in the sand for quite some time. It is important that we get busy. It is important that we get busy in making a difference, in changing our culture in many ways in order to be better equipped to deal with the problems we  have in this environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is also abundantly clear that we also have to make sure that our head is not in the clouds and that we are being realistic about the economy we have created, about the number of people on the face of this Earth who depend on this economy, and how critically important it is to provide the kind of partnership and empowerment to our existing culture to make the transition from what we have to what we want to have in terms of dealing with our climate through the economic engines we have in  this great land, in this great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues have mentioned, the environmental impact of inaction threatens our coastline, the polar icecaps, weather patterns, and animal migration, but it also threatens our ability to be competitive in the world marketplace and to grow the kinds of jobs we truly want to grow if we ignore the opportunities that exist if we do this correctly. If we do this correctly, we can not only provide the kind of move in the right direction that will be positive for our environment, but we  can also seize the opportunity to empower industry and our economy in a way that we can grow jobs at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the environmental danger that climate change poses is so considerable, I am also very concerned about many aspects of this bill. The reality is that the bill we have here before us today cannot pass. We cannot pass this legislation and believe the problem is going to be fixed because there are multiple problems. It is not just the climate and not just the environment,  it is all of the things that contribute to it. As we move forward, it is the  hard-working Americans who participate in this economy whom we have to consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pathway to saving the planet will require that we partner with the business community and empower them to transition from an old energy economy and energy technologies dating back centuries, to the emerging energy economy and the emerging energy technologies needed for a new, cleaner economy and a new, cleaner environment. Failure to do so could lead to the loss of jobs in communities all across our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it could also lead to a failed environmental policy because the fact is, if we do not get this right now, we could spend the next 2 or 3 years dealing with legislation that might not work, is not going to have all of the intricacies and all of the matters dealt with that need to be dealt with. And 3 years down the road, what happens? We repeal it? We have wasted 3 precious years, 3 or 4 precious years, where we could have been working productively to reach the goal of strengthening our economy  and preserving our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another concern is the unintended hardships the bill might place on the elderly and working families, particularly in my State. I am sure other Senators have those same concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a State with a median income level of $37,420, ranking Arkansas 48th among all States, many of my constituents live paycheck to paycheck absolutely every week. I am rightfully concerned about a bill that could drive up utility rates, with the costs being passed on to consumers. And for my constituents, even a $15-per-month increase in their energy bills would be devastating. Now, for some of us, $15 we will notice, but it might not make a difference between whether we are going to sign our  kids up for Little League or whether we are going to be able to help our grandparents or our parents with their prescription drugs or even put food on the table. But for some hard-working Americans, those kinds of increases could mean an awful lot. That is why it is all the more important that we get this bill right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to support climate change legislation. That is something I feel very passionate about. I want to because I believe it is ultimately our responsibility to preserve and protect our planet for future generations. I truly believe we can no longer afford to put our heads in the sand about this issue. We have to move forward. We have to express the importance and the urgency of this issue. But I also echo that it is critically important we get it right. That is why I say the devil is in the  details.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward in these discussions on what we are doing, we have to pay critical attention to the details of this bill. It is why we cannot afford to have, as I said, our heads in the clouds about the realities of the issues that are associated without fully understanding the impact of this bill as we have looked at it today, as currently written, on industry and working families of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I dedicate myself to making sure not only that we passionately look at this issue for all the right reasons of preserving our environment but that we also equally as passionately look at this bill to make sure the mechanisms that partner us with the economy and the engines of economy we get right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to working closely with the sponsors of the legislation as well as the industries in my State and all across this Nation. We have an obligation, an obligation and a responsibility not only to protect this environment but also to protect the incredible working families whom we represent, the hard-fought jobs they work in day-in and day-out to care for their families, and the good corporate citizens that are trying their best to make sure those jobs stay in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we can craft a proposal that will appropriately balance the needs of business and consumers, especially those most vulnerable to an increase in energy costs or a shift in our culture of energy, to protect our environment for our children and our grandchildren but also to keep that balance in recognition with how important that impact is on our communities across our States and across this great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do so appreciate all of the hard work, the enormous effort so many Senators have put into this bill. Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner and, of course, Chairman Boxer have all invested a tremendous amount of time in this bill. As we continue to move forward in looking at this issue, in looking for solutions, I hope that in their leadership they will embrace all of the Senators who have great ideas in terms of how we can move forward in making this a success, in  preserving our environment but ensuring that the working people of this country and the hard-fought industries that are here providing the jobs we want to see stay in this great country, that they are going to have a seat at the table and come up with a bill that will benefit everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I still have some questions about what we are dealing with and the debate we had and will continue to have, I want to keep my door open. I want to work with my colleagues to address the real and the long-term issues of climate change in the weeks and months ahead. But I also want to make sure our focus does not lose sight of the other consequences that come from this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the debate we have had, and I look forward to the coming months as we will continue to refocus ourselves, rededicate our time to making sure--making sure that any bill we come up with that we come to the floor and ask one another to give a final vote on will be a bill that we have embraced from all different perspectives of finding the solutions we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This underlying bill is clearly not that bill, and many of us have grave concerns about where the priorities are in this bill and how we make those priorities more positive in all directions. I look forward to regaining our time and energy and being able to come back and talk about these issues and really solve all of the problems, all of the consequences that come with our ultimate passion of wanting to ensure that we do take a stand on climate change and that we do embrace our opportunity to  make sure we do not make it irreversible in terms of what climate change is; that we will work hard to ensure that our children and our grandchildren will have an incredible planet to be able to live on, to work on, and again to reach their every potential and their every possibility.</paragraph>
