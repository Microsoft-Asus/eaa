    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in a recent speech in my home State of Pennsylvania, one of the candidates for President referred to the possibility of his daughter conceiving a child as a "punishment." In referring to his own two daughters, he said, "I am going to teach them first about values and morals, but if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby. I  don't want them punished with an STD."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree that teens should be taught about values and morals. But I find it disturbing that any candidate for high office finds the notion of a grandchild to be punishment, a punishment on the same level as a sexually transmitted disease. Have we come this far? Has the opposing party embraced an ideology that is so opposed to life that a grandchild is seen as a punishment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the same speech he said, "This is an example where good people can disagree." Well, I see nothing good about believing a grandchild is a punishment. Not his most eloquent or uniting speech.</paragraph>
