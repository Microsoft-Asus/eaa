    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today as a proud sports fan from the City of Cleveland, Ohio. Yes, I have said it. What about those Indians? It has been years since Clevelanders can stand up and say they are proud of their professional sports teams and can actually point to success. Yet just this year the Cavaliers made the NBA finals for the first time in franchise history and on the back of our young superstar, Lebron James. After a strong draft in the spring, the Cleveland Browns  looked competitive for the first time since the franchise returned in 1999, save one season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the main reason I stand today is to congratulate the Cleveland Indians for their first trip to the ALCS since 1998. Cleveland fans have been through a lot of disappointment in our sports history. Two losses for the Browns in the 1980s in the AFC championship by a drive and a fluke fumble. Losses to Michael Jordan's Bulls by the Cavs in the Eastern Conference finals in the early 1990s, and most recently in a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series in the 9th inning to the Florida  Marlins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a lifelong Clevelander, it has been difficult to live through so many near misses, and it makes you yearn for the days of Jim Brown and Bob Feller. The Indians displayed such a consistent level, failures during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, that the movie "Major League" was made depicting a fictional Indians team that was supposed to be the worst ever in baseball. However, all this disappointment changed in the 1990s when the Indians moved to their current home, Jacobs Field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was not so long ago that the Indians were competing for the World Series every year. Throughout the 1990s, the Indians made the World Series twice, in 1995 and 1997, and made the playoffs 5 straight years from 1994 to 1999. After a few bad years, the Indians were rebuilding through the early part of the 2000s, and I must credit General Manager Mark Shapiro for putting together a young, talented team that looks poised to become the class of the AL Central for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the Indians won the AL Central crown and tied for the best record in baseball with the Boston, what are they called? Boston Red Sox. I must say, this team is exciting to watch. We have a rising star in center fielder Grady Sizemore, the best one-two pitching punch in baseball with CC Sabathia and Fausto Carmona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to give a special shout out to veteran outfielder Kenny Lofton. Kenny is the only player on the roster who played with the Indians during  their playoff runs in the 1990s. Kenny has played for 11 teams in his 17-year baseball career, including nine different teams in the last seven seasons. He played nine of those seasons with Cleveland, and I was so happy to see him return during this season. He provides veteran leadership in the Indians lineup,  and his performance in the ALDS is one of the main reasons the Indians have moved on to the ALCS. Cleveland is proud to have him back, and hopefully he can help lead the Tribe to the World Series victory he has worked for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Indians have been very impressive so far this postseason, defeating the vulnerable--veteran, excuse me, vulnerable now, New York Yankees in four games and closing out the series this past Monday in New York. I can't wait to see them take on the Boston Red Sox this Friday and hopefully win the series to get into the World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a tough few decades for Cleveland sports fans, but this year is providing hope for success in the future. This success is so wonderful and cherished by a community that has experienced so much economic loss. So I am grateful that our sports serve as a beacon of pride for Cleveland. I want to thank the owners, the management, and most of all the hard-working, young players, the Browns, the Cavs and the great Indians. And I want to say they do a good job in representing the City of  Cleveland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I just want to close with one more thing. Go Tribe! Go Indians! Go Cleveland!</paragraph>
