    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's program "Reliable Sources," has strongly criticized the media's coverage of Senator BARACK OBAMA's breaking his promise that he would accept public campaign funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Sunday, Kurtz argued: "All of these liberal commentators who have always supported campaign finance reform, getting big money out of politics, many of them are defending OBAMA. And I have to think the press is cutting him a break here."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kurtz concluded the segment by saying, "If George W. Bush had done this, blown off public financing as he considered doing during the 2004 campaign, there would be howls in the media about one candidate trying to buy an election."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent poll found that, by more than a 3-to-1 margin, voters believe the media favors Senator BARACK OBAMA over Senator JOHN MCCAIN. The media should report the facts, not slant the news.</paragraph>
