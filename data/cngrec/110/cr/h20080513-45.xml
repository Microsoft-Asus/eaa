    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in offering my deepest sympathy and that of the constituents of the 18th Congressional District to the people of Mainland China, the People's Republic of China, for the enormous tragedy that they are now facing. There are 12,000 expected dead and more, some 19,000 still buried. And what has been the singular tragedy is innocent children sitting in their classroom seats and having a building collapse upon them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told that if this earthquake had occurred in the United States, it would range from Maine to Arizona. We can imagine the enormity of this tragic situation. I would hope that the United States is moving quickly to be of assistance and that we will keep the people of China, the People's Republic of China, in our thoughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as we offer them our prayers and thoughts, let us be reminded of those in the United States who suffered through the terrible tornadoes that our country has been experiencing over a period of time. I hope we will keep all in our prayers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
