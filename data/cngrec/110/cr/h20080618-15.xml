  <narrative>LISTENING TO CONSTITUENTS ON ENERGY PRICE INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5486]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412256" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Congress continues its debate on domestic energy policy, we must be aware of what our constituents are saying, both at home and at work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this past week, I had the pleasure of touring two manufacturing plants in my district. These plants provide hundreds of good-paying jobs and produce high-quality products for our Nation's economy. During my tours, the management of these companies said that hands down, rising energy costs are their number one concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As energy costs rise, production costs rise as well at these plants. As production costs rise, companies all over the United States face competition from foreign manufacturers who have lower labor costs and, in some instances, lower fuel costs. Countries like China and India, who are currently exploring  many forms of domestic energy production, are able to offer lower production costs directly tied to their lower energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current congressional leadership, Congress will not even consider domestic exploration and recovery of an abundance of energy resources that we have here in the United States. With these energy resources, we can grow our own economy, retain American jobs and prevent them from being taken overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that energy equals manufacturing which equals jobs, and we in Congress must remember that as our energy debate continues.</paragraph>
