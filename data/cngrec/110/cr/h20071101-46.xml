  <narrative>SINGING THE BLUES -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12443]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, radio stations pay a set contract amount for recording label companies to play their songs. Part of that money goes to the writer of the songs for each time the song is aired. But the performers get a set fee from the record label company, no matter how many times their songs are played on the radio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the performers want the Federal Government to charge radio stations a performance fee each time the song is played. That money would go to the performer. In other words, tax radio stations to subsidize the performers because, God bless them, they just don't make enough money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has no business interfering in the free market and subsidizing performers at taxpayers' expense. The music artists and their agents should work out a better contract with their recording companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal to subsidize recording artists would require the cost to be passed on to the consumers by higher advertising fees. Plus, the whole concept smacks in the face of freedom of the airwaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government needs to stay out of the radio control business, even if performers are just "Singing the Blues."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
