  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the new Democratic House addresses two of our Nation's most important issues, global warming and energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new Democratic Congress recognizes that we must take wide-ranging action to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and to cut our greenhouse gas emissions to protect our planet, to reduce energy prices, and to boost our economy while strengthening our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we will bring an Energy and Water funding bill to the floor that makes a significant investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We invest $51 million more than the President has asked for in our solar energy and more affordable, $70 million more for the development of biofuels, and $59 million more to develop technologies to improve our fuel efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this new Democratic Congress is serious about addressing the issues that have been ignored for far too long. I would hope our energy bill would receive strong bipartisan support this week.</paragraph>
