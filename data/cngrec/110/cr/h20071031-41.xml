  <narrative>REINTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF ANCIENT REMAINS -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12351]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved a bill that included a two-word addition to existing law that effectively blocks the scientific study of ancient skeletal remains discovered on Federal land. This change, tucked into what is being called a technical corrections bill, is very far from a minor "technical correction." It is a fundamental shift in existing law and would overturn a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court, which is second  only to the Supreme Court. Such an extreme action should not be hidden within a mostly noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court expressly allowed the research and scientific study of ancient human remains found in the United States. The Senate bill seeks to quietly erase our Nation's ability to study our past and the planet's human history. The Tri-Cities community in my central Washington district needs no introduction to this issue. They experienced firsthand the court battles that ensued after the 9,300-year-old Kennewick Man remains were discovered on the banks of the Columbia  River in 1996. These remains are among the oldest found in North America, and the quality of the remains has the potential to yield researchers greater insight into the early history of man in North America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A full 8 years after the Kennewick Man's discovery, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in 2004, as I have explained, that the remains were to be studied by scientists. Then, during the last Congress, the Senate first sought its two-word addition in "technical corrections." I introduced a bill to challenge and publicize this action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the Senate committee decided to try again last month in this Congress. I am forced once again to respond by reintroducing my bill. My bill very simply and plainly ensures the ability for scientific study of truly ancient remains. If this matter is pushed to the Senate, then let us have a full, open and honest debate about what the Senate Indian Affairs Committee would do to scientific study in our country. The effort to quietly slide through such a dramatic change needs to stop. Those  who support it should explain why and give a justification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope the introduction of my legislation will help bring balance to what is being done on the other side of the Capitol, and that scientific inquiry is not extinguished through the quiet acts of the United States.</paragraph>
