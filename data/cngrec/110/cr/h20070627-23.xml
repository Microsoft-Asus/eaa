  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I represent West Texas, which is the home of significant energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow the Democrats will roll out their new energy policy. As we evaluate these proposals, it is our job to challenge them. If these new proposals cost more American jobs than they create, let's challenge them. If these new proposals unnecessarily increase costs to American consumers, let's challenge those. If these new proposals make us more dependent on foreign sources of natural gas and crude oil than we currently are, let's challenge those. If these proposals really result in less energy  for America, let's challenge those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's bright energy future lies not in new taxes and mandates, but in commonsense solutions.</paragraph>
