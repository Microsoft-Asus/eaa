    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is Covering the Uninsured Week, so I wanted to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues about the 9 million children in America that live without health insurance. I also wanted to take the opportunity to remind the American people that just last month, the Democratic Congress passed a 2008 budget that includes a $50 billion increase in funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did it without raising a penny of taxes. By contrast,  the President submitted a budget that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would cut 1 million additional children out of the Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully for the American people, Madam Speaker, Democrats rejected the President's budget in favor of one that expands health care for children.</paragraph>
