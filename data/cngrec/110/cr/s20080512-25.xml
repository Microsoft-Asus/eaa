  <narrative>PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT -- (Senate - May 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4022">S4022</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are debating a number of measures in the next couple of days, and one of them that is before the Senate right now is the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. I wish to speak for a couple of moments about that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would allow States that do not currently provide first responders with collective bargaining rights 2 years to revise their State law to do that. After 2 years, the Federal Labor Relations Authority would become responsible for protecting the rights of first responders in those States that still don't provide these rights. The Federal Labor Relations Authority would issue regulations to establish procedures for employees to choose whether to form a union for collective bargaining  but would not have any say in the terms of the agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is critically important for us to respond to emergencies across the country. There are some States that can do it better than others because of limitations. We think at times such as this of the tragedy of 9/11, and it is important at this time to remember that every New York City firefighter, emergency medical person, every police officer who responded to the disaster at the World Trade Center on that horrific day in American history was, in fact, a union member under a collective  bargaining agreement. So their unions strengthened their ability to respond to this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, would give public safety officers the right to bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions, and would ensure that these rights are enforceable in State court. It also provides an efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism for labor-management conflicts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that this bill does not force any specific regulatory scheme on the States. It gives States plenty of leeway to adopt new collective bargaining laws that make sense for their States. States that choose not to craft their own system can get the help of the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess in summary form, we think of the importance of this legislation in the context of the threats we face: the threat of terrorism, the threat of disasters, all kinds of threats our communities are faced with. I and a lot of other Americans, I believe, want to make sure those who are putting their lives on the line every day, whether they are firefighters or police officers or other emergency personnel, have the peace of mind to know they are protected under law and that they also have the  ability to negotiate and watch out for their own wages, benefits, and working conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this legislation seeks to do: To bring States that don't currently have this in place--this labor relations authority in place--to make sure we are doing that in every State of the Union so no matter where you live, those who are protecting us--the police officers, firefighters, and others--have the ability to benefit from the protections they should have under law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, as so many others who have already done so, to support the Public Safety Employer-Employees Cooperation Act. It is very important legislation, and it is important that we pass it here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor, and note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
