  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="HONORING REYNOLDS, NORTH DAKOTA">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its anniversary. On July 27-29, the residents of Reynolds will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reynolds is a vibrant community located in eastern North Dakota. Founded in 1880, years before North Dakota was granted statehood, Reynolds was named for Dr. Henry A. Reynolds, who served as a surgeon in the Civil War and had recently migrated to the area from Maine. Reynolds, like many other North Dakota communities, was originally incorporated with the arrival of the railroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reynolds is now, and always has been, a very unique community. The city itself has two churches, two elevators, and is separated by two counties. The number two is very important to the residents of Reynolds, and celebrating its quasquicentennial 2 years late is, as the community says, kind of a "Reynoldsism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Reynolds has much to celebrate. Its 125th+2 celebration will be an event worth taking in. Festivities will include a steak fry, parade, street fair, alumni baseball game, fireworks, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Reynolds, ND, and its residents on their first 127 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Reynolds and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Reynolds that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reynolds has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
