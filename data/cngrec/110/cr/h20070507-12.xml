  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy, who the state newspaper has recognized as a "blunt and uncompromising pro-American conservative."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a person of French heritage, I welcome this change of course in France. We appreciate that France was our first ally in the American Revolution, as symbolized by the portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette here in the Chamber. France is a major investor in America, and I am grateful the midlands of South Carolina is home to three Michelin plants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America and France have a common enemy in the global war on terrorism, and we have mutually beneficial goals of economic development for our citizens. The French Caucus in Congress looks forward to promoting our vibrant partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The election of Nicolas Sarkozy is a welcomed change to restore the warm relationship America desires with France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
