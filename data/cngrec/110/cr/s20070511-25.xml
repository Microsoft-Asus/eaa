    <paragraph>Mr. President, due to my flight from Rhode Island being delayed, I was unavoidably absent for vote No. 151, the Cochran second-degree amendment No. 1010 to the Dorgan amendment No. 990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had I been present, I would have opposed the Cochran amendment. While I have supported the Cochran amendment in the past, the amendment this time seeks to amend a different and vastly strengthened Dorgan reimportation proposal. Senators Dorgan and Snowe have acknowledged the safety concerns that have been raised in the past and have sought to address them. Specifically, their amendment establishes a framework for the registration and regulation of exporting pharmacies and wholesalers.  It also directs the FDA to initiate a process to approve identical medications as FDA-approved products in the United States. The amendment also requires clear labeling and documentation of the drug from the point of origin to the point of sale. I believe these series of measures greatly improve the Dorgan amendment, reduce the risk of counterfeit products entering the domestic drug supply chain, and assure the safety of reimported</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come for Congress to move forward with a thoughtful and responsible framework for drug reimportation. In a free market economy such as ours, it seems unfair that we have permitted a system that only allows the manufacturers to reimport drug products. It is essential that we find ways to reduce drug prices for Americans and one approach is by allowing drug reimportation. As such, we can and should, with the appropriate safeguards, allow a more open prescription drug reimportation  regime to take hold in this country. The Dorgan-Snowe proposal offers a reasonable and responsible framework for such an endeavor to begin.</paragraph>
