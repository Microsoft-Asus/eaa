    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the State of Oklahoma will celebrate its centennial birthday, and today I come to the House floor to commemorate and honor our State's rich history. And, most of all, I am here to honor the people of Oklahoma, our greatest strength, whose hard work and pioneer spirit have written a truly unique chapter in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oklahoma has been defined by the adventuresome nature of the men and women who settled there. Although we are a young State, our legacy is significant. Oklahoma has gone from Indian territory to land runs to a State on the cutting edge of American agriculture and energy production. Each portion of our history has left a unique imprint on the culture of our State and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 100 years after Oklahoma achieved statehood, we have so much to offer: a tremendous quality of life, a work ethic second to none, and a pioneer spirit just as much alive as it was a century ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the eve of our centennial, we honor all Oklahomans. We have our household names, Will Rogers to Jim Thorpe, but there are millions of others of hardworking, compassionate Oklahomans. I just wish Oklahoma a happy birthday, and may God continue to bless our State.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
