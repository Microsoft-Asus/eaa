    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, recently I introduced a bill to repeal some of the legislative provisions that have led to an artificial demand for ethanol. <bill type="h" number="5911">H.R. 5911</bill>, the Remove Incentives for Producing Ethanol Act of 2008, or RIPE Act, repeals the renewable fuel standard, repeals tax credits for ethanol producers, and repeals tariffs and duties on imported ethanol. These incentives are giving ethanol producers a guaranteed market for their product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic corn, already a heavily subsidized commodity, has been the primary source of biofuel, and the mandate has encouraged farmers to focus agriculture production away from food production toward fuel production. The Department of Agriculture has said that the biofuel mandate has raised fuel prices as much as 20 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, ethanol's role as a supposed savior for our energy woes has been severely overstated. Ethanol as a fuel yields about 30 percent less energy per gallon than a gallon of gasoline. This is what happens when government picks winners and losers in the economy and the marketplace. Just 4 months ago, we were convinced we had a winner. It's turned out to be a big loser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to remove the incentive. I urge support of <bill type="h" number="5911">H.R. 5911</bill>.</paragraph>
