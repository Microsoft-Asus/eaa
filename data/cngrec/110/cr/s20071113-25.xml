  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the farm bill before us. We have been trying for a week to do amendments on the bill. The Republicans have said that because this bill is being handled in such an unusual procedural way, they are not going to let us move forward on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is being handled similar to every farm bill in the last 30 years. In that entire period, there has only been one time that a nongermane amendment was offered, and that was on the last farm bill when Senator Kyl offered an amendment dealing with the estate tax. It was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That is it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for the minority to cry about this is simply that they are crying about something there is no reason to cry about. We want to move this bill. I had a conversation this morning right over here on the floor with the distinguished Republican leader and the ranking member of the committee, Saxby Chambliss. At that time, as I understood the conversation, the Republicans had 10 amendments they wanted to do. Let's look at them. We have some we want to do. Let's pare them off, set very short  time limits on them, and move this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important bill. If this bill does not move forward--a bill that is being treated similar to every other farm bill in recent history--the reason it is not going forward is the Republicans. If they do not want a farm bill, why don't they say so. They can explain to all the farm organizations around the country that they did not want a farm bill, they wanted us to extend what is now in existence. If that is what they want, why don't they say so?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate we have been unable to move forward on these amendments. The first amendment pending is a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Dorgan. It is a good amendment. It is one that should be debated and voted on. Another amendment is a complete substitute--that is my understanding--and Senator Lugar and Senator Lautenberg want to do that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's debate it, find out what the will of the Senate is, and move on. But to be in this position is really unfair to farm State Senators, to farmers and ranchers, to the Senate, and to our country. If you are unwilling to fight, just say so. If you don't want this bill to come forward, just tell us that. Don't play these games that they are not treating us right procedurally. This is the way this bill is always handled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just think it is something we need to do. It is an important piece of legislation. The committee, on a bipartisan basis, reported this bill out with an overwhelming vote. This is not a Democratic bill; it is a bill reported out by the Agriculture Committee on a bipartisan basis. So I hope this afternoon we can get some work done on the farm bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Will the leader yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am happy to yield to my friend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank our majority leader for all the support he has given us in getting this bill through even when we worked in committee and working with the Finance Committee to make sure we had the necessary money to meet our obligations and bringing it to the floor in a timely manner. We had all last week; we couldn't get anything done. We have this week before we go home for the Thanksgiving break. We could finish this bill, I say to our leader, we could finish this bill if we could just  get the other side to agree to start the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an amendment, I say to the leader, before us which we could debate. We could even put a time limit on it. We have another amendment on which we could put a time limit. We could get two or three or four amendments done today. But, I say to the leader, I am very frustrated that we have the farm bill out here, we are ready to go--we have been ready for some time--there are amendments filed, and we would like to get started on it, but we can't until the minority leader agrees to move ahead  and says we can bring up some of these amendments and move ahead on them. I just hope we don't waste another whole day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the leader, is there any way we can get the other side to kind of help move us along? I have talked to my ranking member, Senator Chambliss. He wants to move ahead. He has the desire, as I do. As the leader pointed out, this bill came out of committee on a bipartisan vote. There are going to be amendments, and I may support some and not others, and I am sure my ranking member will support some and not others, but that is the amendment process. I think we have a good bill that is  going to wind up getting a lot of support on the Senate floor, and the sooner we get to it, the better off we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am just kind of perplexed, I guess, as to why the minority leader won't let us move ahead or why we can't get some amendments and time agreements.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would say to my friend that we have, as I understand it, 22 amendments upon which the 2 managers have agreed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>We could take care of those very quickly. There are amendments that, in the minds of the managers, improve the bill. We should get those done. We are unable to move on anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The calendar dictates a lot of what happens here in Washington in Congress. We have a limited amount of time. We have 3 very short weeks when we come back after Thanksgiving before Christmas. I say to my friends, we are not going to have time to work on the farm bill when we come back after Christmas. We don't have time. We have to take care of all of our appropriations matters. The funding for this Government runs out on December 14. We have some must-do things that run out at the end of this  year. So the record should be spread with the fact that Senate Democrats have been willing and terribly interested in moving this farm bill. If it doesn't go forward, the blame is at the doorstep of my Republican colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in the majority. We Democrats are in the majority, but it is a slim majority. The way the Senate operates, the Republicans can stop us from doing a lot--not everything but a lot. But I would bet, if there were a fair vote and not some arm-flexing exercise, that a vast majority of Democrats and Republicans want this farm bill to move forward. Are they asking me--is this what they are asking--to file cloture on this bill so we can have a cloture vote on it Thursday? Is that what they want?  Is that what we are going to be relegated to, filing cloture on this bill without having heard a single amendment? And why? Because they won't let us. Is that what they want? If cloture fails--I know it will fail, not because of Democrats but because of Republicans. We know we</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my leader, if he will yield again, I think we have set a record in committee. In a day and a half, we had a comprehensive, 5-year farm bill passed--in a day and a half. I don't think that has ever been done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend, that was the culmination of weeks and weeks----</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Months.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of meetings between Democrats and Republicans to move this bill along.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have great admiration for the Agriculture Committee for getting a bill out of that committee on a bipartisan basis. There are people who want  very badly to try to improve this bill, but nothing will be done. It is Tuesday. We have this bridge thing coming, dealing with the Iraq war, tomorrow. Time is wasting. I am beginning to have my doubts, I say to everyone here, because of the intransigence of the Republicans, that we can do a farm bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I hope we can overcome that because, as the leader said, we had great agreement in committee. He is right. We worked weeks and weeks and weeks in meetings with people in getting it all together, and in a day and a half we got it through on a unanimous vote--not one dissenting vote. So we have a good bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend, on the floor right now are farm State Senators--Arkansas, Georgia, North Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa--and in the back of the room is a State that does a lot of agricultural products, the State of New York. Now, as I look around this room, Senator Dorgan is an example. Senator Dorgan's amendment is pending--a bipartisan amendment. He supports this bill. It came out of committee, but he thinks it would be an improvement. Why shouldn't  he have an opportunity to offer that amendment and have a debate on it? That is what this is all about. It is unfair to everyone concerned, as I have mentioned before, that we are not able to move on this important piece of legislation. I am from the State of Nevada. We grow</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Oh, I am sorry. And Kentucky grows things too.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would just say to my friend, the majority leader, I am on the Agriculture Committee. I am from a farm State. I want a farm bill. We have been discussing how to go forward. If I may be so bold to suggest--I know Senator Chambliss and Senator Harkin have been working on a list of amendments. I think we ought to see if we can lock in a list. It will be bigger than we would like, but that is the way it always starts. Most of those will go away in one way  or another, but at least it would help define the universe. I think that is achievable, hopefully sometime this afternoon, and it will allow us to get started. That is what I would recommend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it would be untoward on the Senate floor to walk over and hug the Republican leader, but that is what I feel like doing. I agree with him 100 percent. I think we should try to get a number of amendments locked in, whether it is 5 or 50, whatever it is. I think we should get it done and start moving on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been, as my friend from Kentucky knows, in a minority position more than I would like to admit here in the Senate as the minority Democratic leader. I understand he has certain things to do within his caucus. Whatever was needed to be proven has been proven. Let's move forward on this bill as the Republican leader has outlined. We greet his suggestion with open arms.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, would the leader yield just one more time?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to ask the minority leader if during this time we are trying to work out a set number of amendments, we know there are two or three amendments that are absolutely going to be offered. One is the one we are on right now. Then there is another one with I think Senators Lugar and Lautenberg. I am just wondering if we could get time agreements on those.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would say to my friend, let's take one step at a time. He has made an offer, and let's see what we can do. He has indicated--the ranking member of the committee is here, you are here, and we will work on that and see if we can get something done in the next little bit.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader. I think that is a good way to go forward, and we will work on it this afternoon.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Georgia is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just say while the leadership is here, we appreciate their assistance in moving this bill. Senator Harkin, Senator Conrad, and I have taken our list of amendments we have out there and we are working through them to try to get down to a reasonable number. One problem, frankly, we are having--and I think maybe on the other side too--is we keep having people come forward with amendments. I would simply say to colleagues on both sides of the  aisle that we are going to reach a limit with these amendments, and if you have an amendment, we need to know about it now so we can negotiate and deliberate in good faith relative to the number of  amendments that are going to be on this list so that we can pare those amendments down to a reasonable number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the leadership for working with us.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>The important point here is that I think everyone on the floor wants to get this bill passed, and while there will be some amendments, my hope and my expectation--I have one amendment--would be that we would relatively easily get time agreements, have a reasonable number of amendments with time agreements. I think there should be a lot of cooperation on the floor because I think all of us want what you want, and that is to get a piece of legislation passed. This was not easy to get  out of the committee. I support this bill. I am going to support a couple of amendments here and there, but by and large I think we are on the right track, and I appreciate hearing the words of the minority leader today on this subject because we need to get this done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, I am enormously relieved to hear what has been discussed, and I hope in the next few moments that we could agree, first of all, on amendments that have to be voted on for both sides, No. 1; No. 2, that we would agree on time limits, and it is very clear that unless the time for the debate on amendments that must be voted on is limited to 1 hour apiece, on average--some could be a little more, some could be a little less, but if we don't on average have  time agreements of 1 hour or less, we cannot finish the work this week; and finally, that we agree to an order. I have seen colleagues who are very interested in some certainty. For example, if we could do Grassley-Dorgan in an hour and a half and then go to Lugar-Lautenberg for an hour and a half to at least begin the process, that would be enormously helpful, and then establish a list in order with time agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to take a moment to respond, as leadership is working on that kind of proposal, to an article that appeared in the Washington Post this morning that I thought was not telling the whole story about this farm bill. They have asserted that there is all this new spending in the farm bill. They focus just on the spending side of the ledger; they didn't focus at all on how we pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to indicate that it is true that there are increases in this bill. We have increased spending on nutrition by $5.3 billion; on conservation, we have increased resources by $4.5 billion; on energy, by $1.1 billion and then an additional $1.4 billion from the Finance Committee, for a total increase in energy of $2.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where did we find the resources for those additional investments? Well, that is the uses on this side, and the sources are on this side. Over one-third of the money came out of the commodity programs. Commodity programs have been reduced. They have been reduced from the baseline. They have been reduced as a share of total Federal spending. The fact that the press--at least some elements of the press--seem unwilling to tell the American people is that the reduction in commodities--over a third  of the money that has been used to give more money for nutrition, more money for conservation, more money for energy, a third of the money came out of commodities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost a third of the money came out of crop insurance. Now, if you are going to tell the story, Washington Post, tell the whole story. These are not just my estimates. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers, or the committee's numbers; these are the numbers from the CBO. They show, on the 2007 farm bill, commodity programs have been cut by $4.2 billion, crop insurance by $3.7 billion, for a total savings out of the $7.9 billion. That is from these so-called baselines. These are facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also seem to overlook the fact that if you look back on the last farm bill, you will see that the estimate at the time was that the farm bill would take 2.3 percent of total Federal spending. The commodity programs were to take three-quarters of 1 percent. Look at the contrast with this farm bill. With this farm bill, the total share of Federal spending is down from 2 1/3  percent to less than 1.9 percent, and commodity programs--the ones that draw all of the conflict and the controversy--have  been dramatically reduced to one-quarter of 1 percent of total Federal spending. The Washington Post never mentions these facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look at commodity program outlays on this chart, here is the baseline at the time of the farm bill. This is what it would cost into the future. Look at the estimates from the CBO on what the commodity programs will cost now. It is a very dramatic reduction in real terms, in relative terms--in whatever terms you want to use. If you are going to report honestly to the American people, then you need to tell them the whole story, not just the story that is the way you want to write it. You  have an obligation to people to tell them the whole story so they can make a judgment about what is fair and what is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is fiscally responsible. It is paid for. It takes up a much smaller share of total Federal spending than the previous farm bill, and the commodity provisions have been cut by two-thirds as a share of total Federal spending. If you look at where the money goes--I will tell you, I sometimes read these articles and hear broadcasts, and I wonder why don't these reporters tell people where the money is going. You would think this is all for subsidies for rich farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, the vast majority of the spending in this bill is going to go to nutrition programs; 66 percent of the money in this bill is going to go for nutrition programs. Have you seen any article written by the major mainstream press that has told the American people that fact? Nutrition programs go to every corner of this country. They are 66 percent of the money in this bill. Crop insurance is 7.6 percent. Conservation is 9 percent. Again, conservation is important to every corner of America.  When you put conservation and nutrition together, that is 75 percent of the spending in the bill. Commodity programs are only less than 14 percent of what is in this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope at some point somebody will start to tell the American people the full story. I certainly don't read it in the Washington Post. I have not seen a single story in the Washington Post about agriculture that I thought was fair and balanced. I have not seen one. They are writing with a point of view. They are writing as advocates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I grew up, news people felt an obligation to try to tell both sides of the story. But, apparently, those days are gone. Today, if a publication has a point of view, or your television program or television station or network has a point of view, that is how you report it. You report one side of the story. That is not responsible, and it is not telling people what they really need to know to make an informed judgment. It is withholding from people certain information they would need to make  any kind of objective judgment. That is what is going on here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want my colleagues to be fooled or to miss the point that this farm bill is taking much less of total Federal spending than the previous farm bill, and the commodity provisions that, in the last farm bill, were estimated to take three-quarters of 1 percent of Federal spending is down to one-quarter of 1 percent. Why do we need that one-quarter of 1 percent? Very simply, because our major competitors, the Europeans, are providing more than three times as much support to their producers  as we provide to ours. This is a fact. The Europeans are providing more than three times as much support to their producers as we provide to ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what happens if you yank this slim rug out from under American producers? Even though we are already outspent more than 3 to 1 by our major competitors, what would happen if we yank that rug out from our producers? Two words: "mass bankruptcy." That is what would happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is anybody paying attention? Do these publications or these news broadcasts give one whit about what happens to the rural economy in America? Why don't they ever report that the Europeans--on export subsidies--are outgunning us more than 80 to 1? That is a fact. But they don't seem to care.  They don't seem to care because, I guess, it doesn't affect their economic lives directly. But I represent a State that has farm and ranch families from one side  of our State to the other, from one corner of North Dakota to the other. The hard reality is they are out there competing against the French and German farmers, and they can do that. They are ready to do that, to take on a fair fight. But when you ask them to take on not just the French and German farmers but the French Government and the German Government, as well, that is not a fair fight. To say to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But some here say, let's not even put up a fight; let's throw in the towel and let the Europeans take over world agriculture. They are already equal to us in world market share. They are already advancing every day, increasing their market share, while ours slips--they are not alone, by the way. It is also our friends in Brazil, Argentina, and other countries who manage their currencies to secure advantage in terms of agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How long will it be, I ask these cynics, before America succumbs on the agricultural front the way we have on automobiles, electronics, and all the others, where our foreign competitors have taken the advantaged position? How long? We are right on the brink of it happening now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This farm bill is an attempt to meet many needs of the American people. As I said, if you look at where the money goes, the overwhelming majority of this money goes for nutrition; 66 percent of the money in this bill goes to nutrition. I hear some of my colleagues from nonfarm States saying, "I don't have a dog in this fight; I don't really care what happens in the farm bill." Really? Then you don't know what is in the bill. Somebody from a nonfarm State who says they don't have anything in  this fight simply don't know what is in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-six percent of the money goes for nutrition, 9 percent for conservation, and more for research and trade. That is where the money goes in this bill. Commodity programs are a small minority of less than 14 percent. As a share of total Federal spending, the commodity parts of this bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will be less than one-quarter of 1 percent of Federal spending. That is a fact. It is an important fact. It is a fact that the Washington Post, apparently, doesn't  want people to know because they never report it. They also never report that the vast majority of this money goes to nutrition programs, or that the next biggest category is conservation. They have an agenda, and their agenda is to look down their nose at people who are in production agriculture, farm, and ranch families, who apparently don't have their respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting, they don't write the same kind of article about any other industry that gets help from the Federal Government. Virtually every industry in America has some kind of Federal assistance, whether it is highways for the trucking industry or airports for the airline industry or any of the other things that are done for industry after industry. I don't see them come after them with this same sort of look-down-your-nose arrogance because that is what it is. It is incredible arrogance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will have a chance to pay attention to both sides of the story in this farm program today. They deserve to hear both sides of the story.</paragraph>
