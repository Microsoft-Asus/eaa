  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of our troops, and I want to underscore that. But I also want to make clear that I am opposed to the war in Iraq. Our service men and women are proudly serving our country. More than 3,063 of our sons and daughters, including 13 from the 32nd Congressional District that I represent, have given their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war, as you know, has cost taxpayers $387 billion so far, and an additional $100 billion to $130 billion is going to be requested by this President. There is no plan to secure the peace. There is no accountability for companies like Halliburton that have been found to make more than $1.4 billion in unreasonable and unsupported billing charges, and our veterans lack the support needed and deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a plan that ensures that there are no permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq, and not a plan to increase the buildup. We need a plan which investigates and punishes companies engaged in war profiteering and fraud and a plan to redeploy our servicemen and women. We need to find a political solution.</paragraph>
