    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress will take up a continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government after September 30. While the House has passed all 12 of its appropriation bills, Senate Republicans continue to obstruct efforts to finish the process over in the other Chamber, making the continuing resolution necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our appropriations bills, we rejected the President's most harmful cuts and made targeted investments in veterans care, education, health care, homeland security, and law enforcement. And we did this all by remaining fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something new around here. Past Republican Congresses refused to abide by the pay-as-you-go philosophy. As a result, they turned a $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus under the Clinton administration into a $3 trillion deficit today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan summarizes the Republican stewardship of the Federal budget best when he states in his new book: "The Republicans in Congress lost their way."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats will continue to be fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
