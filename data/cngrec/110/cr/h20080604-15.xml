  <narrative>HELP OUR FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4880]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I learned yesterday from reports that the State of South Carolina has the lowest gas in the Nation. It was reported that the average gas price in South Carolina is $3.79, and most other States have an average of about 20 cents higher or right at $4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of people would think that's good news. In fact, some would give me the opportunity to congratulate South Carolina. But I'm not going to use this platform to deliver good news because it's not good news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not good news to the South Carolina citizens or citizens anywhere in this country. What would be good news is to see that the "commonsense" energy plan that was promised by the majority party is brought to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am tired of my families putting their hard-earned paychecks into their tanks every week, Madam Speaker. The American citizens need good news, and we need to bring energy legislation  to the floor now to help our hard-working families.</paragraph>
