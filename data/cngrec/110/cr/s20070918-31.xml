  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="TRIBUTE TO DR. MARTIN D. ABELOFF">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of Dr. Martin Abeloff, a leader in Maryland's health care community who passed away last Thursday, September 14, 2007. Our State and our Nation have lost a phenomenally gifted doctor who was also a pioneer in the fight against cancer. Tragically, his life was taken by the disease he dedicated his career to fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Martin Abeloff was an internationally recognized oncologist who for 15 years led the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, one of America's premier cancer research and treatment centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure as cancer center director, Dr. Abeloff doubled the size of the center's facility, helped increase research funding sixfold, and expanded facilities to nearly 1 million square feet of treatment and research space. Under his leadership, some of the most salient findings in cancer genetics and cancer cell biology were realized and have begun to be translated into patient care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foremost a humanitarian, Dr. Abeloff was an activist who worked diligently to get clinical trials legislation passed in Maryland to ensure that cancer patients have access to state-of-the-art therapies. A staunch advocate for tobacco control, he led the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund initiatives at Johns Hopkins supporting research and cancer prevention outreach to benefit poor and underserved communities burdened by disproportionately high cancer death rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A trusted authority and adviser, Abeloff had served as president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, chairman of the FDA Oncology Drug Advisory Committee, and he had been a member of the National Cancer Institute Executive Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is remembered by his colleagues and friends across the globe for his characteristic humility, wry sense of humor, extraordinary devotion to his patients and students, and the collaborative spirit he nurtured in his long tenure at Johns Hopkins, where he spent most of his career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Edward Miller, the CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine, described Abeloff as an "iconic Hopkins physician, scientist, educator, leader, and good citizen rolled into one."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to express my condolences to Dr. Abeloff's family and to the Johns Hopkins community, which will also miss him greatly. I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering him today.</paragraph>
