    <paragraph>First, Madam President, I would like to welcome everyone back here in the Chamber. We have had a week break, and we are king of the hill because the House is out this week, so we don't have to compete with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning there will be a 60-minute period of morning business, with Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes and the majority controlling the final 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will debate concurrently the two stem cell bills. Under an order entered prior to the Easter recess, debate on the two bills is for a period up to 20 hours. I anticipate we will enter an order to provide for designated segments of time to be utilized for those who support and oppose the measures. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today. Both the distinguished Republican leader and I have scheduled our work caucuses for tomorrow rather  than today, when they normally take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have a speech that I am going to give today. I didn't alert the distinguished Republican leader that I was going to give that, so I yield to him, if he has anything he would like to say.</paragraph>
