    <paragraph>Mr. President, I cannot let the day go by without at least acknowledging a conversation I had yesterday afternoon with the father of another fallen soldier from Nevada. We lost two in 1 week. His boy just turned 19. I talked to his dad who was very sad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listened to the news this morning, and nine American soldiers were killed yesterday in Iraq. So we are going to continue doing what we can to have the President change course in Iraq. The present course is not working. We need a plan to bring our soldiers home.</paragraph>
