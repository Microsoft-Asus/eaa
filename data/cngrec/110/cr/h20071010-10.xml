  <narrative>STOP OVERTAXATION AND OVERSPENDING -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11398]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that Democrats remain ready to tax and spend as much as they can. Whether it's a war tax, an Internet tax, or a cigarette tax that will overly burden low-income families, the first Democrat solution seems to be to tax hard-working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when they are not trying to raise taxes on American workers, they are spending their hard-earned money at reckless levels. The $23 billion in new domestic spending this majority has proposed is just another sign that they feel they know better how to spend your own money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must restore fiscal sanity to government, but we should do that by making the necessary decisions here in Washington to save taxpayer money and spend wisely. Both parties need to pass fiscally responsible appropriations legislation rather than wait until we are forced to vote on a giant omnibus spending bill that will be full of earmarks. Let's stop asking Americans to pay for government's inability to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
