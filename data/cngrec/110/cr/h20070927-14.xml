    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Brain Injury Alliance of South Carolina and to thank them for their service in raising public awareness of brain injuries. Leaders of this cause have been my longtime friends Lyman and JoAnne Whitehead of Irmo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An estimated 1.4 million Americans sustain a brain injury yearly. In particular, many of our brave men and women serving in the central front of Iraq and Afghanistan have experienced some form of traumatic brain injury. It is vital that we do all that we can to address our veterans just as we address the needs of civilians living with this condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Brain Injury Alliance is helping to lead the way in informing the public of the dangers of this complex injury and what can be done to help individuals rehabilitate. Their public awareness campaign uses different forms of media and community outreach to ensure that citizens are well educated on this issue. Thousands of individuals and their families will surely benefit from this thoughtful assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
