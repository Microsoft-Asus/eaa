    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1089, which I introduced on Tuesday, calling for an end to the Vietnamese Government's imprisonment, detention and harassment of those who signed the Manifesto on Freedom and Democracy For Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 8, 2006, 118 Vietnamese citizens signed a manifesto in support of peaceful action to bring democracy and basic human rights to the Vietnamese people. Thousands of Vietnamese people have since signed this document, refusing to be silent while their government continues to violate their human rights. In retaliation, the Government of Vietnam has jailed, detained and harassed those brave people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced this important resolution to mark the 2-year anniversary of the original signing of the manifesto and to highlight the ongoing human rights atrocities in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only does my resolution call on the Government of Vietnam to release peaceful advocates, but it also asks our State Department to establish a list of Countries of Particular Concern based on human rights violations, which would hold nations like Vietnam accountable.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
