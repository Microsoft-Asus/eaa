    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the academic achievements of two schools in Kentucky's Fourth District. Boyd County Middle School in Ashland and North Oldham Middle School in Goshen were recently recognized by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform as "Schools to Watch."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Forum selected 59 schools nationwide to receive this prestigious honor. Schools were chosen based on three criteria: academic excellence, responsiveness to the needs and interests of young adolescents, and commitment to helping all students achieve at a high level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I had the opportunity to meet with educators from these schools during their visit to Washington, DC. I was impressed by the commitment of these educators. And though they face innumerable challenges in their classrooms, they are dedicated to providing each student with the highest quality education possible. I am proud to know that these exceptional teachers are educating future generations of Kentuckians. I applaud their hard work and thank them for their leadership, enthusiasm, and  dedication.</paragraph>
