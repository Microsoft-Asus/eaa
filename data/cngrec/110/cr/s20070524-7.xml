    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader on the question of the troop funding bill. It appears as if it is now in a form that is satisfactory to the President and will, in fact, get the necessary funding to the troops for the mission through the end of September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share the view of the majority leader that we ought to wrap this matter up at the earliest possible time, as soon as we get it from the House of Representatives, which could even be later today. So I think we are in the same place on wrapping this bill up and getting it down to the President for signature at the earliest possible time.</paragraph>
