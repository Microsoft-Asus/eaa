  <narrative>UNNECESSARY DELAY IN PASSING VETERANS APPROPRIATIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10515]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the unnecessary delay in passing this year's veterans appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's veterans appropriations passed with an overwhelming majority in both Houses, 409-2 in this body and 92-1 in the Senate. This kind of bipartisanship makes it clear to all that Congress takes its obligation to our Nation's veterans very seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely believe America's veterans want to see a final version of veterans funding quickly passed so they may receive the desperately needed funding. However, I feel this will not be the case. Last week, one Democratic aide, asked about this year's veterans appropriations, was quoted in Roll Call saying, "These bills constitute the little bit of leverage we have."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the sacrifices that our young men and women are making in Iraq and Afghanistan are not leverage. The tragedies that occurred at Walter Reed are not leverage. Veterans health care is not political leverage. We must recognize that veterans funding is critical and should not be used for partisan politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to rise above the partisan bickering and pass this. Our veterans are demanding: Do not betray us.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
