  <narrative>EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10818]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the speaker very much, and again for his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise not because I would have wanted this vote today on the Emergency Economic Stabilization rescue package to be characterized as it has been characterized as "a vote of the moment" historic vote because I believe historic votes are votes that are absolutely imperative, that no one could foresee, that the challenges cannot be handled in any other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this instance, we have been floating money for the past 8 years, ignoring regulation, ignoring the spiraling unemployment. And even though the motives were good to give opportunities to those who eagerly work every day and seek the American Dream, the vehicles, the facilities by which we allowed them or gave them the opportunity to seek and to attain those dreams was not theirs, it was the financial houses that saw big dollars in the eyes, the minds and the hearts of hardworking families that  simply wanted to provide a homework desk for their children, their children's own room. So it caught Members, if you will, cast about in the suggestion and the characterization made by the administration, but made as well by media rushing to hysteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, of course, in the midst of this debate did not come the Senate's vote, which many people will think was one-upsmanship, but really what came as startling numbers--the numbers of 159,000 people who lost their jobs in this last month, the highest in 5 years; the fact that we needed to extend unemployment, not because people are deadbeat, but because they're out of luck, because they need this opportunity; came the number of 759,000 jobs that we have lost; came the unfortunate facts that credit  crunching was going on, not necessarily for the seventh grader who may want to go to college 5 years from now, but for the person who desperately needs to buy a car or the small business that desperately needs to make their payroll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a person who voted no because I believe the restraints on the Secretary of the Treasury were unfettered, the vote that I took on Monday, these rising issues drew on my conscience. No one had to call me. I wasn't pushed by this candidate or that candidate. It was the deliberation that Members individually reflected upon as they listened to constituents, as we, in essence, refuted some of their points or agreed with some of those, no to the bailout. But I think we have to take stands sometimes  that are painful; and not that anyone should be sympathetic to that, that is our job. But this was not a historic moment. And the only reason I say that is it was the making of something that did not have to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So how do we go forward? Well, I am grateful to a leadership that understood that we had to take this particular position. And they did it with diplomacy and acumen and smartness. So I thank them, all of them, the Democratic leadership. But at the same time, we have to be vigilant. My support came today because I believe that we are, if you will, recessed at the call of the Chair. If we find that this is not helping Mr. and Mrs. America, Mr. and Mrs. Main Street, this Congress can come back lickity  split, and I will be there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also recognize that there may be unfettered powers by this particular Secretary of the Treasury, but we have the Constitution, we have our powers to stop any use of power that may be abusive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we can again question the FDIC and make them function, the SEC, and make it function, the Federal Reserve, and make it function. We should continue to emphasize that those who engage in criminal improprieties should be subject to criminal prosecution. We should press for the American man and woman and homeowner the rights of bankruptcy so individually they can go in in a dignified way and restructure their loan and keep their house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should recognize that section 109 should be a section that is required. It has to do with working out mortgages. It says "encourage it." We want to make sure that we prioritize those who are holding bad mortgages, who have a home they want to save, and make sure that the Secretary is working to require them to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on judicial review, we need to make sure that it really works. We need to put aside money for those who need that to restructure their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I close by saying yes, I voted "aye," because those who were victims needed something to move the  credit crunch along so that they could be helped, and I hope that we have done something that makes a difference.</paragraph>
