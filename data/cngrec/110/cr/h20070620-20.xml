  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when Democrats took control of Congress earlier this year, we vowed to restore accountability here in Washington. Unfortunately, President Bush is stubbornly resistant to any changes in the status quo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Case in point: Earlier this year we passed the Accountability in Contracting Act which cleans up government contracting abuses and no-bid contracts that companies like Halliburton and KBR have made infamous. The bill overwhelmingly passed here in the House, and yet the Bush administration says it currently opposes the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've all heard about the $100 million compensation packages that executives walk away with at the same time their company is laying off their employees. So we in Congress passed a corporate accountability bill that enhances the accountability of corporate management shareholders by allowing a nonbinding vote by shareholders on executive compensation plans. But the administration opposes this legislation in its current form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite opposition from the President and his party, Democrats will continue to serve as a catalyst for change to care about ordinary, hardworking Americans and bring real accountability here in Washington.</paragraph>
