  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="642">H. Res. 642</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on September 4, 2007, Hurricane Felix, a Category 5 storm, hit the Nicaragua-Honduras border, causing over 40,000 people in Nicaragua and Honduras to be evacuated, and killing at least 100 people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas just weeks before, Hurricane Dean, a Category 5 storm, hit Mexico and the Caribbean coast, killed 27 persons, displaced over 260,000 persons, and destroyed over 36,000 homes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Hurricane Henriette, a Category 1 storm, made landfall along the Baja California peninsula of Mexico hours after Hurricane Felix made landfall, the first time since 1949 that two Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes hit land on the same day;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas for the first time in the recorded history of hurricanes, two Category 5 storms, Hurricanes Dean and Felix, made landfall during the same year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Hurricane Henriette, though less powerful than Hurricane Felix, killed 7 people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the homes of at least 5,000 Central Americans were damaged or destroyed by Hurricanes Felix and Henriette;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas thousands more individuals were unable to be evacuated and forced to endure these hurricanes in the shelter of their own homes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Hurricane Felix obtained wind speeds of over 160 miles-an-hour, causing widespread destruction with heavy rains and subsequent mudslides and floods expected to follow;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Hurricane Felix hit the Miskito Coast, home to the Miskito Indians, an indigenous population of Central America;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas relief organizations have reported that thousands of Miskito Indians were stranded on the coast and unable to travel to safer regions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the poorest civilians of Honduras and Guatemala who live in hillside villages will be most susceptible to mudslides due to their inland location;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Honduras and Nicaragua, the poorest countries of Central America, have economies that rely heavily on limited agricultural exports, which make both countries extremely vulnerable to natural disasters;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas major tourist destinations, including Cabo San Lucas, the Mayan Riviera, Cancun, Acapulco, and a host of Caribbean islands, were forced to evacuate due to the hurricanes, thus harming the tourist industry on which these areas depend; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Honduras and Nicaragua were still rebuilding after the devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed nearly 11,000 people and left more than 8,000 people missing, destroyed the infrastructures and economies of both countries, and caused billions of dollars in damage: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) expresses its sympathy to and support for the people and governments of the countries of Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico in this time of devastation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) vows its continued friendship and support for our neighbors in Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) urges all parties to continue their efforts in evacuating and providing aid to those individuals displaced by the hurricanes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) recognizes the United States Government's initial efforts to provide assistance to populations affected by the hurricanes and urges increased and continued assistance as the effects of the hurricanes continue to unfold;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) encourages public institutions, specialized agencies, as well as private citizens, to offer their resources; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (6) recognizes the efforts of relief organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the international community, in aiding the people and governments involved.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 642 pertains to the hurricanes that have struck Latin America in recent weeks and expresses sympathy and support for the people and the governments of the countries of Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico, which have suffered from Hurricanes Felix, Dean, and Henriette and whose complete economic and fatality toll are still unknown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all saw in the news in recent weeks, these hurricanes have devastated much of that region. We here in the House of Representatives want to express our sympathy and support for all the peoples in those regions that were impacted. We want to thank all those who have responded to the emergency with aid and various other efforts to help them and recognize the efforts of the United States in particular to do that and that we pledge to continue that help in any way we can as they try to recover  from these terrible tragedies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in the U.S. know only too well the impacts of hurricanes and want to be as helpful as we can to our neighbors in helping them get through this very difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hurricanes Felix, Dean, and Henriette delivered a devastating toll to the countries of Mexico, the rest of Central America, and the Caribbean. Between the three hurricanes, nearly 200 lives were lost, hundreds of thousands of people were displaced, and thousands of homes were destroyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues today to express our sincere sympathy and support for the people who have suffered as a result of these destructive storms. The resiliency of the people of these nations to overcome the tremendous power of these catastrophes has been truly tested. When Hurricane Felix hit on September 4, Honduras and Nicaragua were still in the midst of rebuilding following the effects of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Especially vulnerable to natural disasters due to their dependence on agricultural  exports and the potential for damaging mudslides, the historic occurrence of two category 5 storms in 1 year had an overwhelming impact for several of the countries in this region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the courage that our neighbors in Mexico, the rest of Central America, and the Caribbean continue to demonstrate in their efforts to overcome the damage wrought, and I admire the courage and the contributions made by relief agencies, private citizens, and the international community to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Felix, Hurricane Dean, and Henriette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our prayers are with the family and friends of those who were harmed by the perils of this terrible storm season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400379" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs again, Mr. Lantos, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, and the entire committee for their quick response to these issues. I think it is very, very important that we in the United States, particularly when we are talking about incidents in Latin America, our neighbors to the south, recognize as quickly as possible our solidarity with their struggles and their difficulties and our pledge to support and help them in any way we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Ms. Solis, who was the prime sponsor of this legislation, for her leadership on this issue. Not just this issue but throughout Latin America on a number of issues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, she has been a tremendous leader for us. She is supposed to be here to speak, but I believe she has been caught up in committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 642, a resolution I authored to express our sympathy and support for those affected by the recent hurricanes in Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean. As the only Member of Congress of Central American descent, I am very concerned about the impact of the hurricanes on this impoverished region of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time, two Category 5 storms, Hurricanes Dean and Felix, made landfall during the same year, both striking Central and Latin America. Earlier this month, Hurricane Felix, a Category 5 storm, made landfall along the remote border of Nicaragua and Honduras. The storm killed over 130 people and damaged or destroyed over 19,000 homes, mostly in Nicaragua. The aftermath has been devastating for thousands of families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hurricane Dean, another Category 5 storm, hit Mexico and the Caribbean coast and killed 27 people and damaged or destroyed over 50,000 homes. Nicaragua, in Central America, is one of the poorest countries in the area and was the hardest hit by Hurricane Felix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The complete economic and human toll of the hurricanes is still unknown, but we must act quickly to ensure that humanitarian aid continues to flow to the communities impacted. Supplies, including food, clean water and rebuilding materials, are essential. Economic aid for the agriculture economies that those countries rely on is also badly needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 642 recognizes the U.S. Government's initial humanitarian efforts and urges increased and continued assistance as the effects of the hurricanes unfold. The resolution also recognizes the efforts of humanitarian relief groups, including the International Red Cross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the United States knows all too well the damage and destruction that can result from hurricanes and other natural disasters. The area I represent in Los Angeles is prone to wildfires and earthquakes, and we are still working to support those affected by Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as Hurricane Katrina showed us how disruptive and damaging natural disasters can be, they are all the worse for less developed countries. We all remember the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 11,000 people and caused catastrophic mudslides in the same region nearly 10 years ago. We can and must help our neighbors in Latin America to recover from these hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 642.</paragraph>
