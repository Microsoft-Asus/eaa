    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 242, <bill type="sr" number="203">S. Res. 203</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will report the resolution by title.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="203">S. Res. 203</bill>) calling on the Government of the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to stop genocide and violence in Darfur, Sudan.</chair>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution,  which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations with an amendment to strike out all after the resolving clause: an amendment to strike the preamble and insert in lieu thereof the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="sr" number="203">S. Res. 203</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas since the conflict in Darfur, Sudan began in 2003, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 2,500,000 displaced as a result of the ongoing and escalating violence;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on July 23, 2004, Congress declared, "the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide" and on September 23, 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that, "genocide has occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur," and "the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on October 13, 2006, the President signed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (Public Law 109-344), which identifies the Government of Sudan as complicit with the forces committing genocide in the Darfur region and urges the President to, "take all necessary and appropriate steps to deny the Government of Sudan access to oil revenues";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President George W. Bush declared in a speech delivered on April 18, 2007, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum that no one "can doubt that genocide is the only word for what is happening in Darfur--and that we have a moral obligation to stop it";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the presence of approximately 7,000 African Union peacekeepers has not deterred the violence and the increasing attacks by the Government-sponsored Janjaweed militia and rebel groups;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Government of Sudan has previously refused to allow implementation of the full-scale peacekeeping mission authorized under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan subsequently negotiated a compromise agreement with the Government of Sudan for a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission to be implemented in 3 phases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the African Union and the United Nations have both affirmed that the Government of Sudan has now stated that it will accept implementation of a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Sudanese government has reneged on and obstructed earlier agreements;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it is critical that the nations of the world, and particularly the members of the United Nations Security Council, take steps to implement the full deployment of this hybrid peacekeeping mission as soon as possible;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China has long-standing economic and military ties with Sudan and continues to strengthen these ties in spite of the on-going genocide in Darfur, as evidenced by the following actions:</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) China reportedly purchases as much as 70 percent of Sudan's oil;</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) China currently has at least $3,000,000,000 invested in the Sudanese energy sector, for a total of $10,000,000,000 since the 1990s;</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) Sudan's Joint Chief of Staff, Haj Ahmed El Gaili, recently visited Beijing for discussions with Chinese Defense Minister Cao Gang Chuan and other military officials as part of an eight-day tour of China; Cao pledged closer military relations with Sudan, saying that China was "willing to further develop cooperation between the two militaries in every sphere";</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) China has reportedly cancelled approximately $100,000,000 in debt owed by the Sudanese Government; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(5) China is building infrastructure in Sudan and provided funds for a presidential palace in Sudan at a reported cost of approximately $20,000,000;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas given its economic interests throughout the region, China has a unique ability to positively influence the Government of Sudan to abandon its genocidal policies and to accept United Nations peacekeepers to join a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the President's Special Envoy to Sudan, Andrew S. Natsios, further said in testimony on April 11, 2007, that "China's substantial economic investment in Sudan gives it considerable potential leverage, and we have made clear to Beijing that the international community will expect China to be part of the solution";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China has previously influenced the Government of Sudan to take steps toward reducing violence and conflict by--</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) abstaining from, and choosing not to obstruct, several important votes in the United Nations Security Council on resolutions related to Sudan, including Resolution 1556, which demanded Sudan disarm militias in Darfur, and Resolution 1706, which called for the deployment of additional United Nations peacekeepers, including up to 17,300 military personnel and up to 3,300 civilian police;</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) helping to facilitate the Addis Ababa framework reached on November 16, 2006, which provides for a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force;</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) sending high-level delegations, including Chinese President Hu Jintao, to Sudan, and encouraging President Bashir to show flexibility and allow the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force to be deployed;</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) making frequent public statements that the Government of Sudan must carry out agreements made within the Addis Ababa framework of November 2006 to admit United Nations peacekeepers to join the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur;</narrative>
  <narrative>(5) pledging to provide military engineers to support African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur;</narrative>
  <narrative>(6) announcing on May 10, 2007, the appointment of a senior diplomat as China's special representative on African affairs who is to focus specific attention on the Darfur issue; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(7) reportedly exercising its influence to help convince the Khartoum government to accept the hybrid peacekeeping mission;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas due to its vast population, its rapidly growing global economy, its large research and development investments and military spending, its seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, China is an emerging power that is increasingly perceived as a leader with significant international reach and responsibility;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in November 2006, China hosted its third Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with more than 40 heads of state in attendance and which focused heavily on trade relations and investment on the African continent as it is expected to double by 2010;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas China is preparing to host the Olympic Summer Games of 2008, the most honorable, venerated, and prestigious international sporting event;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas China should be held accountable to act consistently with the Olympic standard of preserving human dignity in Darfur, Sudan and around the world; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas China has previously been reluctant to use its full influence to improve the human rights situation in Darfur, but recent events have demonstrated the impact that China can have as a positive influence on this situation: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes the close relationship between China and Sudan and strongly urges the Government of the People's Republic of China to use its full influence to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) urge the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, to abide by his agreement to allow a robust peacekeeping force under United Nations command and control as described in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) call for Sudanese compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, and the Darfur Peace Agreement, all of which demand that the Government of Sudan disarm militias operating in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) call on all parties to the conflict to adhere to the 2004 N'Djamena ceasefire agreement and the recently-agreed United Nations communique which commits the Sudanese government to improve conditions for humanitarian organizations and ensure they have unfettered access to the populations they serve;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) emphasize that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur and that the formation and implementation of a legitimate peace agreement between all parties will contribute toward the welfare and stability of the entire nation and broader region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) urge all rebel groups to unify and assist all parties to come to the negotiating table in good faith;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) urge the Government of southern Sudan to play a more active role in pressing for legitimate peace talks and take immediate steps to support and assist in the revitalization of such talks along 1 single coordinated track;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) continue to engage collaboratively in high-level diplomacy and multilateral efforts toward a renewed peace process; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) join the international community in imposing economic and other consequences on the Government of Sudan if that government continues to carry out or support attacks on innocent civilians and frustrate diplomatic efforts; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics, which is to bring together nations and people from all over the world in peace, is incompatible with any actions, directly or indirectly, supporting acts of genocide.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
