    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the House will consider the 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which addresses our most pressing security needs in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation makes many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission a reality. It puts new emphasis on protecting our ports and our rail and transit systems. Aviation security is also strengthened with improvements to baggage screenings and a requirement that doubles the amount of cargo screened for explosives on passenger aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the bill makes critical investments into border and immigration security as well, by increasing the number of Border Patrol agents to a record 17,800 agents in all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides for the protection of our Nation while ensuring that taxpayer dollars are well spent by acquiring accountability of our tax dollars.</paragraph>
