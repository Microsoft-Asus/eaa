    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we see with Representative Davis, in any instant a spark turns cool. The State of Wisconsin and the city of Crandon are in mourning today over the tragic loss of seven of their beloved children whose lives were lost in a violent outrage following a young lovers' quarrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lost forever, but never to be forgotten, will be these beloved children, so  dearly treasured by all who knew and loved them: Jordanne Murray, Katrina McCorkle, Leanna Thomas, Aaron Smith, Bradley Schultz, Lindsey Stahl, and Tyler Peterson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all people in northeast Wisconsin and beyond, please know that we share your grief. And to all family and friends of those who remain on this saddest of days, we mourn with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some things there can never be a reason why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for a moment of silence.</paragraph>
