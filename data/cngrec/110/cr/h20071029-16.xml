  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas, during war, rape and sexual violence are often used systematically as a weapon of intimidation, humiliation, terror and ethnic cleansing;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it is estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 women and girls were raped during the genocide in Rwanda;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on September 2, 1998, the United National International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda found Jean Paul Akayesu guilty of rape and held that rape and sexual assault constitute crimes against humanity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on October 31, 2000, the United Nations Security Council adopted Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), calling on all parties to an armed conflict to take, "special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which entered into force on July 1, 2002, states that rape and "any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" may constitute both "crimes against humanity" and "war crimes";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since 2003, mass rape committed by members of the Sudanese armed forces and affiliated militias with the support of the Government of Sudan has been a central component of the Government of Sudan's violence and ethnic cleansing in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas women and girls leaving Internally Displaced Persons camps in Darfur and refugee camps in eastern Chad, to seek firewood, water or outside sources of income are often attacked and subjected to rape and sexual violence perpetrated by members of the Sudanese armed forces and associated Janjaweed militia and other armed combatants;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on July 19, 2004, Amnesty International reported that it collected the names of 250 women who had been raped in Darfur and information on 250 additional rapes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on January 25, 2005, the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, in a report to the United Nations Secretary General, reported numerous cases of mass rape throughout Darfur including an incident in which a large number of Janjaweed attacked a boarding school, and raped as many as 110 girls;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on October 14, 2005, the Secretary General of the United Nations reported "Many girls have given birth as a result of rape. Although local communities are trying to accept the offspring, the children face a great deal of stigmatization.";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on March 9, 2007, members of the United Nations High-Level Mission on the situation of human rights in Darfur reported that "rape and sexual assualt have been widespread and systematic, terrorizing women and breaking down families and communities" and that "women are also attacked in and around refugee camps in eastern Chad";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on April 27, 2007, the International Criminal Court, acting under the authority provided in Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005), issued arrest warrants for Sudan's Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ahmad Muhammad Harun and Janjaweed Colonel Ali Muhammad Al Abd-Al-Raham seeking their arrest for 51 counts including 6 counts involving rape;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas under Sudanese law victims of rape have virtually no legal recourse and may in fact be charged with the crime of zina, or sexual intercourse outside of marriage, punishable by one hundred lashes if the victim is unmarried and death by stoning if she is married;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on July 31, 2007, the United Nations Security Council adopted Security Council Resolution 1769 authorizing the deployment of a United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force (UNAMID) to Darfur and expressing strong concern about "on-going attacks on the civilian population and humanitarian workers and continued and widespread sexual violence" while "emphasising the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on August 20, 2007, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, reported on attacks, abductions and systematic rapes of women in Darfur and the resulting "grave health risks from the consequent physical injuries and psychological trauma", and declared that these acts may "constitute war crimes": Now, therefore be it:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) calls upon the President of the United States to develop within the United States Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development a Women and Girls of Darfur Initiative to improve assistance to victims and potential victims of rape and sexual violence in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad and the Central African Republic by--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) offering specialized grants to non-governmental organizations, operating within IDP and refugee camps in Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic that can provide all essential quality health care services and medical supplies, psychological and social counseling, and legal advice to Darfuri victims of rape and sexual violence;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

(B) call on the Government of Sudan to provide full legal protections to victims of rape and sexual violence and to bring to justice individuals responsible for such crimes; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (C) adopt under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter a Security Council Resolution calling on the Government of Sudan to respect all related Security Council Resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005), enforce the arrest warrants for Ahmad Muhammad Harun and Ali Muhammad Al Abd-Al-Raham, and further recognize the systematic rape of women and girls in Darfur as crimes against humanity and war crimes. &lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro for this important resolution that focuses again on one of the most heinous crimes of war known to humans: the rape of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the process of the Darfur genocide, women and girls have been targeted specifically. And I will let her speak more about this, but when women living in refugee camps, for example, were asked why they went to fetch water and risk rape rather than the men, they answered, If we let the men go, they will be killed. It is better for us to be raped than for our husbands to be killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on and on, Mr. Speaker, but I will reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the resolution by my good friend, Ms. DeLauro, H. Resolution 726, which calls on the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and to halt acts of rape and sexual violence, all of which are occurring in Darfur, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Lantos; and, of course, the lead sponsor, my friend Ms. DeLauro for their flexibility in accommodating concerns raised prior to the introduction and then during the committee consideration with regard to nonessential health issues and the International Criminal Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With those issues addressed in the amendment before us, we now have a strong resolution that effectively focuses much-needed attention on the  horrific reality that has befallen women and young girls in Darfur without contradicting our U.S. policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of this conflict, Mr. Speaker, Sudanese Armed Forces, janjaweed militias, and other rebel factions have used rape as a weapon of war. Despite the conclusions of the Darfur Peace Agreement and the deployment of peacekeepers, these attacks have continued unabated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pattern of rape and sexual violence is widespread and systematic, and it seems that no one is spared. Elderly women, pregnant mothers, even girls as young as 10 years of age have fallen victim to the rapist thugs who attack with immunity. This is a horrific practice that must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully support efforts to provide essential health and psychosocial services to these women and girls as well as efforts to hold those responsible for such attacks accountable for their actions. I strongly support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the author of the resolution, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400103" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee, and I rise in support of House Resolution 726, calling on the President of the United States and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and to prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to introduce this resolution, and I have been proud to work with my colleague Chairman Lantos, whose attention to the crisis in Darfur has been unrelenting. His dedication made it possible to move this important legislation through the committee and onto the floor of the House so quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend Congressman BRAD MILLER also took a lead on this resolution, and following his trip to Darfur this summer, he has shared his unique insight about the region and our responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And today it is also important to note that we have reached this point together with my colleagues from across the aisle. Congresswoman ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN led our bipartisan collaboration, and we now have the support of more than 100 cosponsors from both parties. That broad support from Members at every point along the political spectrum makes sense because this is not a political issue; it is a moral issue. And it is urgent. We have an obligation to act and to act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of the United States Congress, we believe we must do everything in our power to protect the basic human rights of individuals around the world, and there may be no greater violation of a woman's or a girl's basic human rights than when she is a victim of rape or sexual violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All too often during war, rape and sexual violence are used systematically as a weapon of intimidation, humiliation, terror, and ethnic cleansing. There is no other way to put it. These crimes are crimes against humanity and war crimes. And we cannot ignore them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The use of rape as a weapon of war is as prevalent today as ever. An average of 40 women are raped every day in the ongoing armed conflict in the Congo. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. And it is estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 women were raped during the genocide in Rwanda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as these atrocities occur in the Darfur conflict region, we must ask ourselves, again, when will we learn from history? The answer, it seems, is not soon enough for the untold number of Darfuri women and girls beaten, kidnapped, and raped, often multiple times by multiple attackers, and held as sex slaves by the Sudanese armed forces, the janjaweed, and other armed combatants. Since the current conflict began over 4 years ago, instances of rape and sexual violence have all been documented  by NGOs like Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders. And the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported on widespread and systematic mass rape occurring in the region as well as grave health risks, psychological trauma, and resulting pregnancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July, the United Nations Security Council adopted its most recent Security Council resolution relating to Darfur in which it expressed strong concern about the "continued and widespread sexual violence" while "emphasizing the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we cannot simply talk about the downward spiral in Darfur or the conditions that have only worsened since the so-called Darfur Peace Agreement was signed in May 2006. As we saw just this weekend, peace talks in Libya appear to be breaking down because key rebel groups refuse to participate, demonstrating that we are a long way from peace and security in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot sit idly by as women and children are targeted. The resolution before us today calls for action. It calls on the President and it calls on the international community to do the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, develop within the State Department and USAID a Women and Girls of Darfur Initiative to, among other things, provide victims and potential victims of rape in Darfur, eastern Chad, and the Central African Republic with all essential and quality medical supplies and health care services, psychological counseling, and legal advice;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, to ensure that a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force is deployed that can properly protect women and girls from and respond to acts of rape and sexual violence;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, three, through the U.N. Security Council, find Sudan in noncompliance with its obligations to protect women and girls and call on Khartoum to bring perpetrators of rape and sexual violence to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our State Department and USAID must make this a top priority. As the rape and murder in Darfur goes on, the perpetrators of these atrocities go unpunished. And while the rhetoric of the administration and the international community have hit the mark, their action has fallen far short. Too much is at stake to allow these atrocities to continue. We have the power, the will, and the moral obligation to stop sexual violence and rape in the Darfur conflict region. There is no reason that we stand  by when we should be acting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I plead with my colleagues to understand what women and girls are undergoing in Darfur and to please pass this resolution. Let's act together in the best interests of women and girls around the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Ms. DeLauro for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="726">H. Res. 726</bill>, a bill responding to acts of rape and sexual violence in the Darfur conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rape and sexual violence are often used as weapons of war. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 women and girls were raped during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s; between 250,000 and 500,000 were raped during the genocide in Rwanda; and today, there are reports of wide and systematic rape and sexual assault of women and girls in the Darfur region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States was the first government to refer to the killing in Darfur as genocide, but this has had little impact on ending the suffering. The suffering continues because the Sudanese government resists the efforts of the international community at every step and the Chinese government refuses to use its unique influence to force the Sudanese government to change its actions. In fact, China may even have prolonged the crisis by shielding Sudan against the collective efforts of the United  Nations. The crisis is now in its 4th year with no end in sight and the suffering of men, women and children continues. That is why I am encouraging passage today of <bill type="hr" number="726">H. Res. 726</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="726">H. Res. 726</bill> requires the U.S. State Department and USAID to develop a women and girls Darfur initiative for the purpose of providing victims and potential victims of rape in Darfur, eastern Chad and the Central African Republic with much needed comprehensive and quality medical supplies and health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also calls upon the Secretary General of the United Nations, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, the European Union, the Arab League and other nations to immediately take steps to ensure that a hybrid UN-African Union peacekeeping force is deployed that can properly protect women and girls from and respond to acts of rape and sexual violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot stand still in the face of systematic and widespread rape in the Darfur region. The U.S. Congress has a moral obligation to reach out and do all it can to put an end to this tragedy. I strongly support this important piece of legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution, and I applaud the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO) for her leadership on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day in Darfur men are tortured and massacred as women and little girls seeking solace and refuge are raped, abused, and murdered. This is a systematic effort to destroy an entire race of people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where is the humanity, Mr. Speaker? Where are our souls? How can we stand by when hundreds and thousands are suffering every day at the hands of their own government?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, on the front page of the Washington Post there is an article entitled "U.S. Promises on Darfur Don't Match Actions". It highlights our Government's inaction during one of the most horrific human rights disasters of our generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every single one of us has a duty to pressure our Government, the United Nations, the world--to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan resolution is not about politics. It is not about pushing an agenda forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation to stand up for the women and children in Darfur against systematic and unchecked abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have no voice, no government, nobody to stand with them, nobody to stand for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day that we wait for a solution to magically appear, is another day that a woman, a child, is stripped of her home, her family, her dignity, her health, and her humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="726">H. Res. 726</bill>.</paragraph>
