    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on the first day of the 110th Congress, the Democratic majority in this House enacted the toughest ethics reform in a generation by passing a landmark rules package that broke the link between lobbyists and legislators. This important step toward cleaning up Congress ended gifts, private jets and meals paid for by lobbyists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, we continued our commitment to restore accountability to Washington and passed the final House-Senate agreement on the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. This tough legislation, which ends the tight-knit relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers takes another major step toward making this Congress the most open and honest in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have supported this critical bill, which has been hailed by reform groups as a "sea of change for citizens" and "landmark reform." I am proud of our Democratic majority that works so quickly to enact real change for Americans, which they demanded during last year's election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Democratic House is dedicated to making sure that Congress works for everyday Americans and not just special interests.</paragraph>
