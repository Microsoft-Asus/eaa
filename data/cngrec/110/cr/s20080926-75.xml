  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="TRIBUTE TO BATTELLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Battelle, one of Ohio's oldest and most respected organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 22, 1938, 70 years ago next month, a sea change in printing occurred, though no one but the inventor, Chester Carlson, and Battelle had the foresight to recognize it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The invention of dry printing, forever memorialized by the etched words "10-22-38 Astoria," was the genesis of an American product so successful its name became eponymous: Xerox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Battelle, the world's largest nonprofit independent research and development organization, began its operations in 1929 at the behest and funding of founder Gordon Battelle's will. Within a few years, it would make history with the same vision, risk taking, and wisdom its employees display to this very day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in today's increasingly paperless era, it is easy to see that a simple, rapid, and inexpensive copying process was one of the 20th century's most important innovations. With the advent of the Xerox machine, the world could make copies at the push of a button.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Battelle lies at the crossroads of necessity and creativity, an intersection we know as innovation. Taking on daunting, real-world challenges with technical prowess and ingenuity is Battelle's hallmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1935, New York patent attorney and amateur physicist Chester Carlson began thinking of easier ways to duplicate material. Extra copies of patent specifications and drawings, sometimes dozens or more, were necessary with each new job. The man-hours needed for each project were staggering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Carlson came up with the unconventional idea of copying by creating a visible image on paper using an electrostatic charge. He filed for a patent in 1937, calling the process electrophotography. He made it work in a real world situation the next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though he shopped for financial backing at more than 20 of America's largest corporations, no one saw the value in Carlson's invention. Then, in 1944, he found Battelle. Even though America was in the midst of World War II, Carlson and Battelle signed a contract to further develop the electrophotography process. Four years later on September 28, 1948 the first public demonstration of the new technology--then named xerography, Greek for dry writing--was performed in Detroit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Partnering in 1959 with a company called Haloid Xerox, Battelle and Carlson forged ahead to produce the first fast, low-cost, and convenient office copier--the 914 model. Xerox would go on to become one of the world's largest corporations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Battelle grew and diversified with earnings from xerography's success. As a result, Battelle is currently the world's largest independent R&amp;D organization. It proves that success comes to those who are willing to take risks, develop needed technology, and nurture the final product with long-term commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, 60 years after the production of the first photocopy, I would like to commend Battelle for its role in the development of the Xerox copy machine and its continued commitment to technological advancement and investment in our Nation's future.</paragraph>
