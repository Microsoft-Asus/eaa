  <narrative>GAO REPORT SHOWS THAT IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS NOT LIVING UP TO ITS PROMISES -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10162]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for months now we have heard from our Republican colleagues that September would be a critical month for the war in Iraq. Earlier this year when this Democratic Congress and the American  people voiced their overwhelming opposition to President Bush's troop escalation plan, our Republican colleagues said, "Give the President time."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, both the Republican Congress and the Bush administration have been moving the time frame for success on the troop escalation plan. First it was June. Then it was August. Finally, a couple of months ago, Republican leaders agreed that September would be the defining month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that President Bush has no intention of ending the troop escalation in Iraq, even though the Iraqi Government has failed to meet the benchmarks that he himself outlined earlier this year. President Bush is determined to leave as many troops in Iraq as possible, no matter what the facts suggest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question now is, will Congressional Republicans finally break away from the President and do what is right for this Nation and for the military? Congressional Republicans must realize that the time has come to change course.</paragraph>
