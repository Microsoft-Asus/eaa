"(i) rely mainly, in the case of students and parents who file income tax returns, on information available on the 1040, 1040EZ, and 1040A; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) include formulas for adjusting income or asset information to produce similar results to the existing approach with less data;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers to the Secretary of Education, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue could be used to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA with student and parent taxpayer data;

"(E) the extent to which States and institutions would accept the data provided by the Internal Revenue Service to prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA in determining the distribution of State and institutional student financial aid funds;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

"(G) the data elements currently collected, as of the time of the study, on the FAFSA that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid, or to administer Federal student financial aid programs, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as whether information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number could be reduced without adverse effects;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(H) additional steps that can be taken to simplify the financial aid application process for students who (or, in the case of dependent students, whose parents) are not required to file an income tax return for the prior taxable year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

"(i) what data are currently used by States to determine eligibility for State student financial aid, and whether the data are used for merit or need-based aid;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) the extent to which the full array of income and asset information currently collected on the FAFSA play an important role in the awarding of need-based State financial aid, and whether the State could use income and asset information that was more limited to support determinations of eligibility for such State aid programs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iii) whether data are required by State law, State regulations, or policy directives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iv) what State official has the authority to advise the Department on what the State requires to calculate need-based State student financial aid;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(v) the extent to which any State-specific information requirements could be met by completion of a State application linked to the electronic version of the FAFSA; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(vi) whether the State can use, as of the time of the study, or could use, a student's expected family contribution based on data from 2 years prior to the student's planned enrollment date and a calculation with reduced data elements and, if not, what additional information would be needed or what changes would be required; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(J) information on institutional needs, including the extent to which institutions of higher education are already using supplemental forms to collect additional data from students and their families to determine eligibility for institutional funds.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to speak a little bit about this very important bill, <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>, the Higher Education Amendments Act of 2007. This legislation is a bipartisan product of 3 years of negotiations by the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, or the HELP Committee. It builds on the legislation the HELP Committee passed in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that the legislation before us today is not a Democratic or a Republican bill; it is a bipartisan bill. We worked on it carefully. We made sure that parts which were objectionable to either side were eliminated or a third way found, and as a result of that very congenial process, it has gotten us to this point where we are on the floor with the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the bill we had last week, which also dealt with higher education--more with the funding issues--this bill covers a number of the other issues. But Republican Senators were able to secure changes to the Higher Education Act that were important to them, as were Democratic Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our committee works a little differently than a lot of the committees. We use the committee markup to see what the objections are to a bill, the intensity of those objections, and identify possible solutions. Then, once the bill has been marked up, we will get together a managers' package that will overcome any remaining objections. I am pleased with the effort that has gone into this bill since markup. We worked together to bring to the floor a piece of legislation that can be supported by the  most liberal and the most conservative Members of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased we are taking up this bill today. The companion legislation, the Higher Education Access Reconciliation Act of 2007, passed the Senate last week, as I mentioned. My colleagues heard me say over and over again last week that the reconciliation bill was only a small piece of the Higher Education Act. Without considering both bills, we would only be doing part of the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank my leadership for hearing me and my Republican colleagues on the HELP Committee when we requested that both these bills be considered sequentially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record and sent to the desk the letter several of us sent requesting that both these higher education bills be considered together.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 12, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR REID AND SENATOR MCCONNELL: On June 20th the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions reported two separate pieces of legislation: <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill> the Higher Education Amendments of 2007, which reauthorizes the discretionary programs within the Higher Education Act; and the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, a reconciliation bill that responds to the Budget Resolution adopted earlier this year. This legislative package takes important steps to make college more affordable,  while ensuring American students have the knowledge and skills they need to be successful in the 21st century economy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Both the reauthorization and reconciliation bills must be considered together on the Senate floor as a comprehensive reform of our laws pertaining to higher education and should not be moved separately. If the Senate moves forward with just the Higher Education Access Act, which as a budget bill has a privileged status, we lose an important opportunity to pass essential bipartisan reforms contained in the Higher Education Amendments bill. The reforms in the reauthorization bill include: simplifying  the student aid application process; authorizing a year-round Pell Grant to better serve non-traditional students; and expanding graduate programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions. More importantly, moving the reconciliation bill without the reauthorization bill would</narrative>
  <narrative>We will only be doing half our job if we allow the reconciliation bill to move forward without the companion reauthorization bill. Such a piecemeal approach to reforming higher education is inadequate. The Senate must ensure an ample and meaningful debate on both bills at the same time so that the vital reforms to higher education are given the attention and scrutiny that they warrant. We urge you to take a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges facing higher education and our status  as a world economic leader by moving both of these bills together on the floor.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="TITLE IX--AMENDMENTS TO OTHER LAWS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we are going to consider the rest of the higher education pie--the foundation of the programs we discussed last week. I believe that without considering both pieces of legislation, we will not make the changes necessary to help students enter into and succeed in higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are all of the pieces of the higher education pie. We see the little red triangle there; that is the reconciliation piece which we did last week, and it deals with the Pell grant funding, primarily. This bill deals with the other pie pieces we see on this chart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ACG, the Academic Competitiveness grants, and the SMART grants, are grants to students who will specialize in science, technology, engineering, math, and some selected languages. These grants provide extra support above the Pell grants, and that is so we turn out the kind of people we need in technical fields to keep the innovation in the United States going. We passed the America COMPETES package that ties in with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teacher quality. The key to a classroom is the teacher. We had to have a piece in there that would encourage teachers and get them extra instruction so they can be better teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FAFSA simplification. There are a lot of people who have not applied for grants because the process is so difficult. You probably saw us last week mention that this was the application--actually, these are the instructions; the applications are equally as long. We have been able, through this bill, to reduce that to a very simple form for students to be able to fill out to see if they can qualify for the Federal help that is available. There is significant Federal help available, and we don't  want anybody not attending higher education, whether it be college or technical school, because they don't have the resources for it. We are trying to provide the resources, and now we are trying to make sure the process isn't so difficult that people skip the process and skip higher education. We need the technical skills that are provided by a higher education, a higher level of thought. So we now have a much easier form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You will also find some little improvements, such as if you do work while you are in junior high and high school and you earn and save some money, you won't be penalized when you apply for college. We want people to be saving their money, not spending their money so that it doesn't count against them when they go to make the application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Graduate and international education, and loan disclosures are also included in this bill. There has been quite a bit of emphasis on this lately. I was pleased to be able, as an accountant, to provide a lot of suggestions for the ways these problems could be handled so that people would know exactly what is available and so that companies and colleges dealing with loans would do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pell grants and campus-based aid are a huge part. It complements the Pell grant work we did last week, which was essential to what we did in the reconciliation bill. And, of course, financial literacy. We incorporate that into our work whenever we possibly can. People need to know as much about their financial situation as possible. It is particularly critical for college students. We don't want them winding up in an impossible situation when they graduate. We want them to be able to take advantage  of the resources available before they enter college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have a lot of pieces that will be completed when we finish the day today, and I am convinced we will be able to complete this today. We have a limited number of amendments, and many are very reasonable and should not be too difficult. We will have discussions on some others. We will have a very bipartisan discussion on what can be put in the bill to complete it, and we will get it done today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is that important? This year marks 50 years since Sputnik was launched. That launch sparked huge turmoil in this country and worry about the knowledge and skills necessary to keep our economy growing and competitive. I was in junior high at the time. It was a shock to our Nation. Every one of us could recognize it--teachers, parents and, probably as important, students, recognized it. Russia was beating us. They had put a satellite into orbit. It shocked us. But it also brought out that American  competitive spirit. We said they were not going to beat us. It launched a change in education such as we had not seen in the United States in decades, maybe centuries. We were ultimately the winners of the space race, but it wasn't just the space race; it was an education race. It was the broad range of education the United States delved into and the innovation that was brought about at the time that put us ahead of Russia. Of course, the Government probably helped considerably too. Sputnik</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are again being challenged. For millions of Americans, access to an affordable college education is the key to their success in the 21st century global economy. In the 1950s, skilled jobs comprised 20 percent of the U.S. job market. In 2000, 85 percent of all U.S. jobs are categorized as skilled. Without some college education, these Americans will not have the qualifications for over 90 percent of the new jobs being created over the next 10 years. It is estimated that 60 percent of tomorrow's  jobs will require skills that only 20 percent of today's workers possess. We have a huge challenge, not just in K-12 and higher education but in continuing education. It is estimated the average person leaving college will change careers 14 times. I didn't say "change jobs" 14 times, I said "change careers" 14 times. That is the pace at which things are accelerating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is an even more important statistic. Of those 14 career changes, 10 of them don't even exist now. So we are  educating people for a level of jobs that do not exist at the present time. That is quite a challenge. In this decade, 40 percent of job growth will be in jobs requiring postsecondary education. Those jobs requiring associate degrees are growing the fastest. Learning is never over; school is never out. Technology is demanding that everybody  continue to learn and gain skills to remain competitive in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's ability to compete in a global economy depends increasingly on the number of students entering and completing college. Of the 75 percent of high school seniors who continue their studies, only 50 percent receive a degree in 5 years after enrolling in college. Only 25 percent of them receive a bachelor's degree or higher. These numbers, incidentally, are even worse for children of low-income families. Among eighth graders in 1988, only 16 percent from low-income families attained a bachelor's  degree by 2000. The fact is that over four times as many eighth graders from high-income families attain bachelor's degrees than from low-income families. This is using the eighth graders from 1988 who should have graduated by 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the chart, you can see the level from low to high income who completed a bachelor's degree based on family income. Some of that is a failure on our part to emphasize to those in the low-income category they can do it and they should do it and how they can do it. That is part of what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to ensure that more students enroll in college prepared to learn and that more students have the support they need to complete college with the knowledge and skills to be successful. Slightly less than one-third--31 percent--of all public high school students are prepared for postsecondary education, as demonstrated by the academic courses they pursue. Well-prepared and well-supported students are more likely to persist to a degree completion and obtain the knowledge and skills  they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, institutions of higher education and employers have expressed their dissatisfaction about the fact that our high school graduates need remedial study or training in order to do college-level work or to participate in the workforce. Nearly one-third of entering college freshmen take at least one remedial course. Each year, taxpayers pay an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion to provide remedial education to students at our public universities and community colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our goal should be to keep the cost of college down, expand the availability of information, help  students and parents make more informed decisions, and improve financial literacy across the board so students and families have a better understanding of how they can manage their loans and monthly payments. Schools and colleges must do more to increase accountability and seek efficiencies that bring down the cost of postsecondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>, the Higher Education Amendments of 2007, refines and focuses Federal policy on access, affordability, and accountability. It attempts to tackle the complexity of the Federal student data system. Right now, filling out the free application for federal student aid prevents many students from even considering college. That was never our intent. This bill, as I pointed out, reduces the number of questions on the FAFSA to those that are necessary to determining the need students have for  financial assistance. We are making the FAFSA less complicated than filling out tax forms, which has not been the case in the past. The bill puts us on the path of greater coordination between Federal agencies so students and their families will have the opportunity to allow information that is already provided to the Government through tax forms, be used to complete the FAFSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, it is our responsibility to ensure that students and their families have the information they need to make informed decisions about the investment of time and money they are making to secure a college education. The cost of college has risen dramatically and at the same time the need for a college education has never been greater. Students will receive upfront information about financial decisions they are making. Similar information would be provided to them periodically throughout their  college experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The quality of classroom teacher preparation is critical to the education of our K-12 students. The goal of the teacher preparation programs supported under this bill is to help teachers be prepared to meet the ever-increasing diverse needs of students and to improve student achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also addresses recent concerns that institutions of higher education and lenders have not been operating in the best interest of students and their families. Although what we have seen are isolated incidents, we wish to make sure the confidence in our institutions and financial aid advisors is not questioned. We have included requirements that institutions establish codes of conduct for how they work with lenders and prohibit incentives and other arrangements that would appear inappropriate.  Students and their parents must have knowledge to make informed choices and financial decisions that will impact their lives for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no longer an option whether to pursue college or skills certification that is nationally recognized. Everybody needs tools to understand and shape their future. Higher education is the onramp to success in the global economy, and it is our responsibility to make sure everyone can access that opportunity and reach their goals. Without a lifetime of education, training, and retraining opportunities for everyone, we will not meet our 21st century needs and challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is tremendous opportunity in the United States. We recently went to India to see why they were winning in some markets and getting American jobs, and their method is kind of abhorrent to Americans, and it should be. They begin excluding students at very early ages. They make the prize very desirable in the end, and that results in lots of people pursuing and competing and getting those few opportunities for higher education out of that huge population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe in higher education for anyone who wants it, and the need is there. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this bill and to consider the amendments that will be offered. I thank Senator Kennedy for working with me and my Republican colleagues in order to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor. As he mentioned last week, this is essentially the bill he and I worked on the past 2 years and wanted to bring to the floor, but were not able to. We now have that opportunity,  and I am pleased everyone is willing to cooperate and get it done quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward, I am hopeful we will move forward with both the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, the reconciliation bill we passed last week, and this bill. The comprehensive reauthorization of both of these bills will make a huge difference. There is no reason they cannot accompany each other moving forward, as they have on the Senate floor. Each complements the other, and without both, the changes made in reconciliation will be less meaningful. I encourage the Democratic leadership  to ensure we don't do just a piece of the pie as we move forward; otherwise, as was said last week, "any way you slice it, higher education is left undone." We need both pieces to get it done right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Senator Kennedy and those on the other side of the aisle on the committee for their tremendous cooperation, participation, focus, and willingness to figure out what we are trying to solve and find a way to solve it. We have done a very adequate job with what is in this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="TITLE IX--AMENDMENTS TO OTHER LAWS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their leadership in getting this higher education bill to the floor. I know they have worked on it for many years now. As I understand it, the current Higher Education Act, which we have had to extend, was scheduled to expire in 2004. We are now getting around to actually passing a reauthorization of that legislation, which I think is very important to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we overwhelmingly approved the student aid package that promises millions of students the ability to afford college. That package included more than $17 billion in student aid over 5 years. For my State of New  Mexico, that translated into $177 million of new aid for New Mexico students and their families over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was glad to be part of the committee that prepared that legislation. I am glad to see it passed by an overwhelming vote of 78 to 18. But financial assistance is only one part of the puzzle, as Senator Enzi pointed out. We need to do more, and the legislation before us today gives us the ability to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we need to do more to address the increasing cost of attending college. Second, we need to ensure more students graduate from college and are prepared to succeed in this 21st-century global economy. And, third, we need to reform the student loan system so it works better for students rather than just for lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this legislation accomplishes all three of those objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These higher education amendments of 2007 have a number of provisions designed to address the rising cost of college. We have all talked about the rising cost of college. The cost of going to college is 6.3 percent higher than it was last year, and the average cost of going to a 4-year college is $13,000 this year. The bill sets forth a comprehensive approach to addressing these problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the amendments will establish a higher education price index to accurately reflect annual changes in tuition and fees for undergraduate students. The Secretary of Education will be required to report annually in a national list and in a list for each State a ranking of colleges according to the extent of changes they have made in their tuition and fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary is also required to establish a higher education price increase watch list in order to hold colleges accountable for their rising costs by publicizing those colleges where increases are the highest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill makes significant changes to the financial aid process. It makes Pell grants available to students all year round so they can take courses during the summer, and they can finish college earlier. It will also simplify the forms that these students have to complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also removes barriers for students with disabilities and students with limited English proficiency so they can apply for financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These amendments provide a number of types of loan forgiveness, scholarships, and fellowship opportunities. Let me mention just a few. The bill provides loan forgiveness for early childhood educators, including Head Start teachers and preschool program instructors, full-time faculty members of tribal colleges and universities, school librarians, speech and language pathologists, and members of the Armed Forces. It authorizes graduate fellowships for minority students and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to increase the number of students who can succeed and graduate from college, and this bill places great emphasis on activities that not only help high school students prepare for college but help those same students succeed in college and graduate from college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The higher education amendments improve student academic readiness for college by strengthening the GEAR UP and TRIO programs. For example, the bill requires GEAR UP partnerships to systematically change the way schools prepare students for college. It requires States and school districts to encourage more students to enroll in rigorous high school course work and emphasizes activities that will support the development of college prep curricula, including advanced placement courses. The bill  also strengthens the TRIO programs by establishing outcome criteria for measuring the quality and effectiveness of the programs around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes a provision that I authored that creates a new grant program to assist colleges and universities that serve large numbers of Native American students. Currently, there is no particular Federal program to assist nontribal schools that provide educational services and support to large Native American student populations. We have a number of such schools in my home State of New Mexico such as San Juan College, University of New Mexico in Gallup, New Mexico State University in Grants,  and the Eastern New Mexico campus in Ruidoso.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides grants to such colleges to improve and expand their capacity to serve Native American students through such activities as curriculum development, academic instruction, faculty development, acquisition of education instruction, research equipment, and a variety of other activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The higher education amendments also improve programs for students whose families are engaged in migrant and seasonal farm work to enter and succeed in college. This is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill authorizes funding for the Navajo Technical College to help pay the costs to operate postsecondary career and technical educational programs for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native American students. This authorization will significantly increase the Navajo Technical College's ability to provide high-quality career and technical training to ensure that Native American students graduate with the skills needed to succeed in this economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very glad this legislation contains provisions from the Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institutions Act of 2007. This is legislation that I introduced, along with Senator Hutchison and others, to establish a long overdue Hispanic-serving institution graduate program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law only provides support for 2-year and 4-year colleges. The percentage of Hispanic students attending college has increased significantly in recent years. Unfortunately, Hispanic students are woefully underrepresented in the graduate programs around our country, and this legislation will try to help solve that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The higher education amendments will also require teacher preparation programs to substantially improve over the next several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as we see the price of college rising steadily, an increased number of students are forced to rely on loans in order to finance their education. We have seen from recent investigations that some lenders in the Student Loan Program, and even some financial aid officers, have been exploiting the student loan system to the detriment of the very students they are meant to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization will make a number of very important changes to the Student Loan Program. It will ensure that colleges recommend lenders to their students based on the best interest of the students and not on the self-interests of the financial aid officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, it will prohibit payments or gifts or other inducements from lenders to colleges or to financial aid administrators that constitute a conflict of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, it will require colleges to establish and follow a code of conduct with respect to student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me reiterate that this is extremely important legislation. I commend the majority leader for bringing it to the Senate floor. I commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their bipartisan effort to move this legislation forward. Together with the student aid package that we approved last week, this legislation will allow us to make college accessible to all and affordable for every family in this country. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Purpose: To provide for the development of a student loan clearinghouse)</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of title VIII, add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 802. STUDENT LOAN CLEARINGHOUSE.</narrative>
  <narrative> (a) Development.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education shall establish 1 or more clearinghouses of information on student loans (including loans under parts B  and D of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq. and 1087a et seq.) and private loans, for both undergraduate and graduate students) for use by prospective borrowers or any person desiring information  regarding available interest rates and other terms from lenders. Such a clearinghouse shall--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) have no affiliation with any institution of higher education or any lender;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) accept nothing of value from any lender, guaranty agency, or any entity affiliated with a lender or guaranty agency, except that the clearinghouse may establish a flat fee to be charged to each listed lender, based on the costs necessary to establish and maintain the clearinghouse;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) provide information regarding the interest rates, fees, borrower benefits, and any other matter that the Department of Education determines relevant to enable prospective borrowers to select a lender;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) provide interest rate information that complies with the Federal Trade Commission guidelines for consumer credit term disclosures; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) be a nonprofit entity.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Publication of List.--The Secretary of Education shall publish a list of clearinghouses described in subsection (a) on the website of the Department of Education and such list shall be updated not less often than every 90 days.</narrative>
  <narrative> (c) Disclosure.--Beginning on the date the first clearinghouse described in subsection (a) is established, each institution of higher education that receives Federal assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) and that designates 1 or more lenders as preferred, suggested, or otherwise recommended shall include a standard disclosure developed by the Secretary of Education on all materials that reference such lenders to inform students that the students  might find a more attractive loan, with a lower interest rate, by visiting a clearinghouse described in subsection (a).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress on whether students are using a clearinghouse described in subsection (a) to find and secure a student loan. The report shall assess whether students could have received a more attractive loan, one with a lower interest rate or better benefits, by using a clearinghouse described in subsection (a) instead of a preferred lender list.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my colleague from New Mexico in commending Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate. It is important legislation and one that I hope we will move to pass very quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about education. I don't know there is a subject much more important than education. H.G. Wells once said that human history becomes a race between education and catastrophe. Education is so unbelievably important. As I was sitting here, I was thinking about this amendment and about education and what it means to our country. I was thinking about something I have told my colleagues previously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first week I served in the Congress, I served in the U.S. House of Representatives. I went to visit, then, the oldest man serving in the Congress. I read a lot about him and was interested in him. So I went to say hello, to greet him. His name was Claude Pepper from Florida. Claude Pepper was an old man by then but a vibrant man nonetheless. He had an office that was very much like a museum, full of history over the many decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated before, one of the things I remember about that morning walking into Claude Pepper's office was seeing all of his memorabilia about his service. But I saw two things that struck me. They were behind his chair looking over his desk. There were two photographs. One was a photograph of December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright making the first powered human flight to leave the surface of the Earth. It was autographed to Congressman Claude Pepper. Before Orville Wright died, he  autographed this wonderful photograph of that little airplane in the wind in Kitty Hawk, NC, leaving the ground. It says: "To Congressman Claude Pepper, with admiration. Orville Wright." I thought, this is interesting. I am speaking to a living man who has an autographed photograph of the first person to leave the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beneath that was something just as interesting. It was Neil Armstrong setting foot on the Moon autographed "To Claude Pepper, with admiration. Neil Armstrong." I thought, these pictures are only about 4 inches apart in frames, but what is the distance between these photographs? From 1903 to 1969, leaving the Earth for the first time in human-powered flight and then stepping on the surface of the Moon. What is that distance measured in? It is measured in education. It comes from this country's  education system--knowledge, engineering, science, mathematics, the knowledge to build flying machines, to build rockets, to build Moon capsules. The basic knowledge comes from our school system, from your education system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know we spend a lot of time in this country describing what is wrong with education. But the fact is, we are the ones who have split the atom and spliced genes. We are the ones who invented the telephone and the television and the computer. We are the ones who built airplanes and then learned to fly them, built rockets and walked on the surface of the Moon, all as a result of the foundation of learning and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the bill comes to the floor of the Senate today saying education is a priority, and it is, and we have some issues with education that we want to fix because we want to strengthen our educational system. It is not that our system is perfect, we know it is not. It needs to be strengthened and improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to higher education, we want to encourage every person in this country who has an urge to get a college degree, to go to a technical school, to go to a vocational school, to be able to advance their interests. In doing so, we offer a series of financial incentives. For those who have no money, we offer Pell grants. For those who have very little money, we offer Stafford loans and direct loans. And for those who perhaps do not qualify for the low-income components, they have other  loan opportunities from private lenders to get the money to go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we want in this country. We want every young child to grow up, and as they grow up, to become whatever their God-given talents can allow them to be. We don't want the brakes to exist for anybody. We want this to be an opportunity for everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall one day when my father came home for supper--and my father was a very successful man, very bright man, did very well in his life, but he only went through sixth grade in school because his mother died during childbirth and my father spent most of his time trying to raise some money and work and try to help his brothers and sisters, who had been farmed out to uncles and aunts and so on. So my dad had only a sixth grade education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall him coming home one day, never having told our family, and announcing at the supper table that he had just passed the GED. He had gotten his high school degree. He was somewhere in his fifties. He had gotten his high school degree. I will never forget the look on his face when he told us: I am a high school graduate. Got my GED.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We didn't even know he was doing it, but he did. It meant the world to him because he had never gotten the opportunity to go beyond the sixth grade. And it means the world to a lot of people, in my judgment, to find out: What are my talents? What capabilities do I have? What are my interests to better myself? What kinds of things am I interested in, and where can I go to college? How can I finish school and then go to college and advance my opportunities?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that is what the legislation that is brought before us today offers us the opportunity to do, to advance those interests. We have done it in steps over many decades, and it is the difference, as the Senator from Wyoming said, it is the difference between this country and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many other countries where they separate these kids at an early age, and they say: Well, based on your track record, based on the way things look for you, you are going in this direction. You are not going to college. And based on the way things look, you are going here. They separate them and they channel kids. Not in this country. We want every single kid to have an opportunity to become whatever their God-given talents allow them to become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the issue is funding for many kids because many young people don't have the money to go to college unless they get some help--Pell grants, Stafford loans, direct loans, and other loans. So we have programs that we have put together that provide that kind of assistance through the student loan process,  and this bill, the underlying bill, strengthens programs to prepare students for college, and it takes important steps to help kids get to college and  then make both kids and colleges accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have rising costs, as everyone knows. Every single parent knows that the costs for a college education are increasing dramatically. With respect to lending money for students going to college, we have discovered recently that there are some abusive lending practices, and this bill takes some steps to address those abusive practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some student lenders have undertaken to secure spots on what are called "preferred lender lists." Some colleges, many colleges, have preferred lender lists. They put out a list that says: Here are the lenders from which you can get a guaranteed loan. There is a lot of money in this process for the lenders, and that is why the lenders are so anxious to be on these lists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My preference would be that we eliminate the lists altogether--eliminate the preferred lender lists--but I don't think that is possible to get through this Chamber at this point, so I am going to do it in another way. I am going to address this in another way with the amendment I have just offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HELP Committee has done an admirable job in digging into this, as well as have, for example, some officials, the attorney general of New York, and others. The HELP Committee has put together some information about colleges and some colleges' financial aid officers soliciting favors, gifts, and financial assistance from lenders in exchange for putting that lender on a preferred list. Here is something that came from the HELP Committee that I noticed when I was looking at this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Bank of America employee noted in an e-mail that Larry Burt, former Director of the University of Texas Office of Student Financial Aid, had requirements to get on the UT-preferred lender list. Again, it is very important to get on these lists for these companies that want to have lending opportunities to students. So here is someone who ran the University of Texas Student Financial Aid Office. This is a quote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy hour with UT loan department staff, staff luncheons, lunch and/or dinner with Larry Burt, parties for Larry's family--birthdays, et cetera--invitations to golf tournaments--expenses paid by lender--and free tickets to sports events. Larry loves tequila and wine--since becoming director at UT Austin, he has not had to buy any tequila or wine--lenders provide this to him on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was an e-mail from a Bank of America employee from a HELP report on marketing practices in the lending program. Not all lenders went along with these inappropriate demands. The HELP Committee investigation said Citibank did not go along with them because they deemed those requests to be inappropriate. And the very next year, apparently, with respect to this campus and Mr. Burt, Citibank was dropped from the UT-preferred lender list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Student Loan Xpress, another major lender, paid $21,000-plus for the chief financial officer at Johns Hopkins University to attend an executive doctorate program at the University of Pennsylvania after the financial aid officer sent the following lender an e-mail. This is the e-mail that went around from the financial aid officer at Johns Hopkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been accepted to a doctoral program at Penn that begins in August. I am searching for  1/2  tuition support--know of any good scholarship programs?? I already know where to get loans--or, why don't you put me on retainer to EdLending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an e-mail from Dr. Ellen Frishberg, former Johns Hopkins University financial aid director. Once again, I think this is important information discovered by the HELP Committee. They began to investigate these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An investigation by New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo uncovered a revenue-sharing agreement between Citibank and Syracuse University. Citibank was paying Syracuse  1/2  percent of the interest earned on student loans steered to the bank--a deal worth about $100,000 a year to the school. According to Attorney General Cuomo's investigation, during the last academic year, 98 percent of Syracuse students who took out loans went through Citibank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just an unusual occurrence? Doesn't sound like it to me. Many lenders have invited college financial aid officers to serve on advisory boards, flying them around the country and various parts of the world and on harbor cruises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why do lenders go through all this trouble? Well, the stakes are high. The student loan business is an $85 billion industry. It has grown 27 percent since 2001, and the lenders listed on the college's preferred lender list typically receive up to 90 percent of the loans taken out by students attending that institution. Again, these are guaranteed loans--guaranteed by the Federal Government. Lenders fight to get to the top of a list--of a preferred lender list--at a college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to one survey, the first lender on the preferred list gets as much as 75 percent of the loan value. So this is big money to private interests that want to get government-guaranteed loans, move them out to students, and make a lot of money off those loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know that the managers of the bill share my concerns. Senators Enzi, along with Alexander, Allard, Burr, Hatch, Isakson, Murkowski, and Roberts introduced legislation to ban preferred lender lists altogether. And Senator Kennedy has worked tirelessly to uncover and document abusive practices. I, frankly, would like to ban preferred lender lists altogether. We don't need preferred lender lists by colleges in  which they describe who gets on the list and who gets to the top of the list. I don't think we ought to be doing that. But it is quite clear we can't ban those lists at the present time, so I am offering a different amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us addresses some of these practices by prohibiting payments, gifts, and other inducements that lenders give to colleges and student aid officers. The bill also forces schools to explain the rationale for selecting preferred lenders, and I think these are important steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't diminish these steps at all. I am concerned that lenders will still do whatever they can do to get on those lists and get to the top of those lists. There are substantial incentives for abuse, and there is no evidence--there is no evidence at all--that the lenders on the preferred list actually offer the best deal to the students.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator's time in support of his amendment has expired.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>As I was saying, there is no evidence that being on the list or put on the list by the college offers the students the best financial arrangement, and with the cost of college increasing at twice the rate of inflation, I think we need to make sure that students have access to affordable loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I offer an amendment that does the following: It will create a clearinghouse of student loans, both Federal and private loans. That clearinghouse will put students in the driver's seat, allowing them to search for a loan that offers the best deal, the best financial arrangements for them, whether that be the loan that has the lowest rate or the loan with the best borrower's benefits. This gives the students the opportunity to shop in an informed way for the best situation for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This type of clearinghouse will create more competition in the student loan industry. I can't imagine that many students would go to this clearinghouse and pick the loan with the highest interest rate. This will empower students. It is not a new concept. In fact, some schools, including the University of North Dakota in my home State, are already directing students to Web sites that allow the students to search through dozens of loan options by themselves to pick the best terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But creating a clearinghouse is not enough. We need to make certain that students know that it exists. My amendment would require schools to include a disclosure statement on their preferred lending list that lets students know that they might find a better deal by visiting the clearinghouse themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment won't cost taxpayers a dime. The clearinghouse would be  fully paid for by nominal fees that lenders would be charged in order to be listed in the clearinghouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, my amendment would direct the Government Accountability Office to issue a report to Congress about whether students have been able to use the clearinghouse and are using the clearinghouse, and it will examine whether students who chose to use one of the school's preferred lenders could have gotten a better rate--better financial arrangements--by visiting the clearinghouse had they done so. It is my hope this report will inform our future efforts in this area. If it becomes clear that  students can do much better by visiting the clearinghouse than by going to preferred lenders, I think we ought to take a hard look at whether the preferred lenders ought to exist at all and whether we ought not in the future to prohibit a preferred lender list and develop, instead, a comprehensive clearinghouse that allows students to find the best arrangements for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this amendment will make the student loan industry more transparent and more accountable to students and their families who already struggle often to pay for these college expenses. So I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is a reasonable and measured approach to clean up some of the abusive practices and to empower students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, again, I would have preferred to just end the preferred lending list, but that is not possible. So this is the step I think accomplishes some of the same goals by empowering students, and I hope the Senate will consider this favorably today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Wyoming.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for offering this amendment. I think we will be able to take it on voice--I know we will be able to take it on a voice vote, and I appreciate what he has done to enhance what we have in the bill that deals with more transparency and better information for students and parents on their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We created a number of new programs and disclosure requirements that will better equip students to make informed choices about how to finance their postsecondary education, which is always desired and what we are always working toward, and we have to find some mechanism through which that can be done. So I appreciate the way in which the Senator from North Dakota has approached this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate, too, his information. I always learn a lot from listening to him, and the Claude Pepper pictures about the 1903 Wright flight and the 1969 Moon landing are particularly interesting. It does show how education is accelerating--learning how to do flight in 1903, landing on the Moon in 1969--but it was the Sputnik event I mentioned in 1957 that touched off a lot of that. So it was essentially 12 years of development that got us to the Moon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to mention the Grameen Bank. The founder of the Grameen Bank got a Nobel Peace prize for the work he has been doing loaning money to poor people. And this is a whole different level of poor than we know about in the United States. His first loan was for 27 cents to a lady who was then able to go into a weaving business. But the point I want to make is that the reason a lot of people aren't able to get loans is because they do not have any collateral. Students fall into that category,  unless their parents have money. The student doesn't have money, and the student doesn't have collateral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have provided for in the United States, through the Higher Education Act, both the reconciliation and this act, is a mechanism for people who don't have collateral but just have that collateral of desire; that collateral of a work ethic to be able to get loans and grants to be able to go on to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The poorer they are, the more grants they qualify for in different ways. But they can get loans based on their desire to go to college. This mechanism, this clearinghouse, will help people make better determinations on their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have a new mechanism which deals with the Parent PLUS loans, which are about 10 percent of the loans. That is going to be an auction process. We looked at some ways to be able to auction the rights to provide the loans in order to bring down the costs, particularly the Federal Government. What we decided on was taking this one category and trying it. To do the whole thing could disrupt the entire student loan process, so we are trying it through an auction process on the Parent PLUS loans.  That will answer some of these questions, too, on certification and perhaps bring down some of the costs. But it will increase the ability of students to get loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his effort. At the appropriate time, we will do a voice vote on that if that is agreeable?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, a voice vote will be fine. I don't know if we are able to clear it now. I think it is cleared on our side. If it were cleared on your side, I think perhaps we could proceed to have it considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me make a point. The Senator mentioned the microcredit issue. I have been in various parts of the world where they are using microcredit. In many ways, it is the same thing as microcredit in a different way--people with no collateral to be able to have some funding to advance themselves. The microcredit approach has been unbelievably successful, giving poor people the opportunity to buy needles for crocheting and bicycles for delivery services in various parts of the world. It was interesting  the Senator referred to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This approach allows a student who has no collateral of any type--all they have is promise, they have the promise of their capability to do better in life if they go to college--it allows them to get a loan to advance their interests. I think it is exactly the right thing.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am offering a very simple amendment today which I hope will get overwhelming bipartisan support. My amendment simply instructs the Government Accountability Office to complete a study regarding the employment of postsecondary education graduates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, we live in a global economy that is creating intense competitive pressure on our workforce. It is more important than ever that our Nation's students, employers, and policymakers have access to good information about the effectiveness of our higher education system as it relates to employment and job placement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my favorite books, one I know many of my colleagues have read, is "The World Is Flat" by Thomas Friedman. According to Friedman, the convergence of advanced technology, the removal of economic and political obstructions, and the rapid introduction of millions of young professionals into the global economy have dramatically flattened the economic playing field. Friedman believes these changes are creating opportunities for people to tap their full potential, boost their prosperity, and  live out their dreams. He believes that Americans with the knowledge, skills, and adaptability to compete in this newly flattened world can look forward to a bright future, while those without these skills will be left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If our higher education system is going to equip our students with the skills they need to compete, we need to have good information on graduate job performance so other students can pick the best schools and the most promising degrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would instruct the GAO to study the feasibility of collecting information on the employment of students who complete a postsecondary education program. It would also instruct the GAO to provide Congress with recommendations on several important questions, including whether the current State programs that bring education and employment functions together can be replicated in other States; whether there is a value to collecting additional information about the employment of postsecondary  graduates; the most promising ways of obtaining and disseminating this information; if a Web site is used, whether the Web site should be run by a Government agency or contracted out to an independent organization; whether a voluntary information system would work, both from the graduates' and employers' perspective; how the information could be used in practical</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I conclude, I wish to explain how powerful this information could be in making our Nation more competitive in the global economy. If students could see how graduates from specific schools and with specific degrees have performed in the workplace, they could make better choices of alternative colleges and universities. If employers could see how graduates of specific schools and with specific degrees performed, they could make better hiring decisions. If colleges and universities could  see exactly how they are performing in equipping students for the workplace, they could make adjustments to better compete with other higher education institutions. Finally, if lawmakers could see exactly how our education system is performing, it would help us all make better policy decisions in this important area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for his interest in this issue and for the assistance he and his staff have provided me. I look forward to working with him and the Senator from Massachusetts to find ways to increase the availability of information we have that connects higher education and employment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his good work on this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GAO study of the feasibility of collecting employment information on college graduates can help us find out how effective the program is before we have another reauthorization. Reliable information on student success, particularly employment success--that is our best measure--is very important to the future of higher education. The postsecondary education system needs facts at the State and institutional levels to identify successes and challenges, and consumers need the information to make  informed decisions about education and training programs. Some States have pretty strong relationships between higher education and State agencies to get those employment statistics, but it is not done nationally. I think this would be a great step to providing that information and helping us to see how well we are doing, as well as the students.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator for what I think is an excellent suggestion. It is an excellent idea. Some years ago, when we had the consolidation of our work-training program, we had 16 work-training programs in 6 different agencies. Under the Kassebaum-Kennedy program, we tried to consolidate those. In those programs, we tried to do an assessment of training programs so someone coming will have the information that will be valuable to them--if they took X program for 8 weeks,  what their possibilities of getting placed were and what the possibilities would be for their income and how that might grow over a period of time. That would give the various students, at that time, the information to know, with what options, what the future was going to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also is helpful to us on our committee to know in what areas individuals are being trained. We have the responsibility in our committee to review where the vacancies are in our job markets and how we are going to deal  with those. The amendment of the Senator is going to take this to another level in terms of the postgraduate education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we will have a chance, when this is achieved, to evaluate what our national needs are as a country and as an economy and whether we want to incentivize them. We can have that as a matter of public discussion and debate, as a Congress, in committees, so the American people understand what is going on in terms of graduate students. It will be enormously valuable and helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We always have a debate and discussion about our doctors: Do we have too many specialists in some areas and don't have enough general practitioners in others? What have been the defining aspects that get them to go into those areas? That is a constant issue our committee is dealing with at any particular time in the reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the amendment of the Senator will have the GAO come back and report. We look forward to working with the Senator when that comes back to try to get us greater information. It is a very solid amendment and a very useful one. I certainly recommend we accept it, for the reasons I have outlined briefly and for the reasons the Senator has explained.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we thank the Senator. We have made good progress this morning on two very useful and important amendments. As we pointed out during the discussion and debate at the end of last week, we are in an extremely fortunate position. We thank the leadership, and I thank Senator Enzi for his persistence, insisting that we deal with the authorization at a time when we are going to deal with the student assistance program. They should be considered together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are grateful to the leadership for giving us the opportunity today to have a good chance to consider some ideas--as we have earlier this morning--some good ideas on the higher education legislation. This legislation is long overdue, and it is appropriate that we address it. We thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, we will have a conclusion of this legislation after we have the consideration of some amendments. I have gone through a number of amendments. They are very solid and helpful and useful to the purpose and thrust of this legislation. We will have a chance to continue the good progress we have made earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did wish to say a word generally about the legislation and highlight some of the provisions. I start off by again thanking my friend and colleague from Wyoming for his very strong work in this area. As I mentioned last week, our committee basically spent a great deal of time on this reauthorization. The legislation we have here today--with the exception, probably, of the provisions we have added on the student loans and perhaps one or two other important issues--is very much the legislation  that would have come through our committee under his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked in a very important tradition and we want to try to maintain that tradition of strong bipartisanship. We have tried to keep this free from some of the other kinds of issues people feel strongly about here on the floor of the Senate because I think both of us understand that the education of the young people of this country is such an overwhelming issue for so many families that we want to try to meet our responsibilities to them and do it in a timely and thoughtful way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That has been the tradition, certainly marks the tradition of this particular reauthorization legislation. This is a place, I say, to join with members of our committee. Again, we have--I think the Senator from Wyoming would agree--a committee that spends a great deal of time on education issues. Whenever we have a markup, we have a very well-informed discussion and debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been an enormous accumulation of knowledge--and always of concern--by the members of our committee for these higher education bills; people who have spent a good deal of time on the education issue, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have wide diversity of our committee, urban areas, rural areas, and we have tried to respond to those kinds of needs. But this reauthorization is extremely important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leading to the creation of the Higher Education Act back in 1965, President Kennedy said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our progress as a Nation can be no swifter than our progress in education, our requirements for world leadership, our hopes for economic growth, and the demands of citizenship itself in an era such as this all require the maximum development of every young American's capacity. The human mind is our fundamental resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those words rang true then, and they ring true today, as our country is once again in a time of war and conflict and faces great economic challenges. Equal access to higher education touches every aspect of American life. In order to compete effectively in the global economy and ensure a well-qualified Armed Forces, we need to equip all our citizens with the sound education from prekindergarten to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, 400,000 students do not go on to a 4-year college simply because they cannot afford to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally devastating--this is the 400,000--it shows that some 400,000 talented students, these are qualified students, students that effectively have the qualifications to gain entrance into institutions of higher learning, by and large; it is because of the lack of financial help and assistance that they do not attend a college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen during the debate and discussion at the end of last week, we need to make a very strong downpayment to provide help and assistance to students and graduates, such as through loan forgiveness, so that if they go into public service, which so many of them want to, we provide a forgiveness program for them that will make a large difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned last week, a key element that is going to help those 400,000 is the work that has been done by the chairman and Senator Reed to make the FAFSA application a good deal simpler. As we have time through the afternoon, if others may wish to address the Senate, I will spend a little time going through the contrast between the two, and you will see the dramatic difference in the change we have had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, our second chart shows the devastating, equally devastating, fact that 47 percent of low-income eight graders will be academically--only 47 percent--will be academically prepared for college at the time of high school graduation, compared to 86 percent of their higher income peers. This is, again, an issue we talked about briefly last week, the growing apart of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education is the key. We do not want to have an education system that is going to help America grow apart. We have made every effort in this legislation to address that broader kind of issue. We are a better nation than that. We are a nation that believes in promise and opportunity for all our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill expired in 2003. It was last updated in 1998. We cannot afford to wait any longer to reaffirm our commitment to higher education in this country and create a framework so our students are prepared to meet the challenges of this new economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am immensely pleased, and I know our committee members are, that we were able to swiftly move to this bill after the passage of the Higher Education Access Act last Thursday. Together, they make up the comprehensive higher education package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, for the strong support in both of these parts of our education program and for considering them in tandem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we passed last week includes several critical features, provisions to help make college affordable. We mentioned those during the debate. But it is important again to recognize the need-based grant aid; a significant increase in the maximum Pell grant; the  repayment provisions that cap loan payments at 15 percent of monthly discretionary income; the loan forgiveness if individuals go into public service jobs; the protection for working students  so those who are working, trying to put themselves through school, are not going to earn so much it will make them ineligible for student assistance programs; and the other protections we have provided for, such as those on active duty, which are Senator Murray's provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt the student aid in the Access Act is the single most important thing we can do to increase access for college-ready, low-income students. But it is also our responsibility to ensure the multibillion dollar investment of taxpayers we make to student aid is delivered in the most effective and efficient way possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This authorization bill will take steps to ensure the greatest return on this investment by addressing rising college costs, reforming the student loan system so it works for students not banks, simplifying the Federal aid application process, strengthening the college preparation programs such as GEAR UP and TRIO and promoting high-quality and effective teacher preparation programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we provide more aid to students, this bill recognizes that colleges need to do their part to keep college costs down. Costs for college have more  than tripled in the last twenty years, as this chart shows. Every middle-income family, who has a child in school or college knows this better than the charts can portray.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The costs have effectively tripled over the last 20 years. So the higher education amendments for 2007 will hold colleges accountable for skyrocketing college costs by creating nationwide watch lists of colleges whose costs are increasing at a rate greater than their peers and by encouraging the Department of Education and colleges to publish more consumer-friendly information about college costs and programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure this aid is directed to students, its intended beneficiaries, we must keep them informed about choices and hold colleges and lenders accountable for getting the students the best loan deal possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation by New York Attorney General Cuomo and other States and our committee have found many lenders are entering into sweetheart deals with colleges. Some lenders offer gifts to college employees in order to secure their student loan business. We have documented how lenders who participated in the Federal student loan program offer educational conferences, luxury hotels, free entertainment, free tickets to sporting events to college officials in order to entice those officials to  recommend the lenders to their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation makes these practices illegal and protects students by ensuring that when a college recommends a lender, it is based on the best interests of students and nothing else. To ensure that students have access to the Federal financial aid they are eligible for, we simplify the financial aid process for all students by reforming the application for Federal student aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, the form is currently 10 pages long and includes more than 100 questions. This chart shows--the people who are watching cannot read the individual lines--but this is 10 pages long. Even up close it is difficult to read the questions. But it is enough to intimidate and inhibit many of the young people from moving ahead with this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, thanks to Senator Enzi and Reed, this bill dramatically simplifies the FAFSA and examines how we can streamline it further in the future. Our bill will make the financial aid process more student friendly by immediately creating a 2-page form, what we call EZ FAFSA, for low-income students and phasing out the current long paper process. It will also create a pilot program to let students know how they can access Federal aid for college earlier by allowing students  to receive an aid determination or estimate in junior high school so they can gain the information about whether they have a real opportunity to go on, to continue on to college, and get the information in an easy to understand and timely way. That is the purpose of this particular effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring access to adequate grant aid is one component of solving the college access crisis. We must also ensure more students are graduating from high school ready to succeed in college. In 2001, colleges required a third of all freshmen to take remedial courses in reading, writing or math.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because so many high school students are not learning the basic skills to succeed in college or work, the Nation loses more than $3.7 billion a year. This figure includes the $1.4 billion to provide the remedial education of students who recently completed high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this figure factors in the almost $2.3 billion the economy loses because remedial students are more likely to drop out of college without a degree, therefore reducing their earning potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is extremely important. That brings us to the work our committee is attempting on the No Child Left Behind Act. The target of that is the lower grades and high school, but we are interested in trying to find a seamless web, so that we're coordinating with Head Start, with kindergarten, coordinating with No Child Left Behind, coordinating with the colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand this ought to be a seamless web, so to speak. It is not, at the present time, and we are committed to trying to do it. If we have these kinds of gaps in the learning process for our students, we are certainly not serving them well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes provisions championed by Senator Brown to maintain the strength of the TRIO and GEAR UP programs which provide underprivileged students with the support they need to go to college and graduate from college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Higher Education Act of 1965 established the National Teacher Corps, a federally funded Great Society program to develop our Nation's teaching force. This bill continues that tradition by promoting high-quality and effective preparation programs for new and prospective teachers. We are very committed to retaining high-quality teachers in high-need schools. This was of particular interest to Senator Nelson, Gaylord Nelson, who is deceased. He was very much involved in that program and it was  very successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill will create a new student safety grant program to help colleges and universities improve their campus safety and emergency response systems. As the nightmare at Virginia Tech made us all too aware, tragedy can strike anywhere, include college campuses. We have important provisions in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation received unanimous bipartisan support in committee. I hope we will see that demonstrated today. One final point, when we are talking about the cost of colleges, we also encourage that states ensure students and families know what they're doing to support higher education. In a number of States, for example, my State of Massachusetts, in recent years, prior to the election of Deval Patrick, under a previous Governor, we saw substantial reductions of State help to colleges, and  so the colleges have no alternative but to raise the fees on young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They didn't say these were increased taxes, but effectively they were for these young families. We had a dramatic reduction in terms of state appropriations for higher education recently. It is important for the American people to understand, are the States helping? Are they doing their fair share or is the fact that we are seeing an increase in particular States the result of State action? We want to make sure the public understands it and that we understand it as well. We are serious about  trying to ensure that college education is affordable and accessible to everyone. This is not the final answer. We have a lot more work to do. But I would hope the students and their families and the education community would feel this is a very important and constructive step. It is reflected in</paragraph>

  <narrative> In section 403(c) of the Higher Education Amendments of 2007, add at the end the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) by adding at the end the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(h) Additional Funds.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(1) AUTHORIZATION.--There are authorized to be appropriated for the upward bound program under this chapter, in addition to any amounts appropriated under section 402A(g), $57,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011 for the Secretary to carry out paragraph (2), except that any amounts that remain unexpended for such purpose for each of such fiscal years may be available for technical assistance and administration costs for the upward bound program under this chapter.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(2) USE OF FUNDS.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) IN GENERAL.--The amounts made available by paragraph (1) for a fiscal year shall be available to provide assistance to applicants for an upward bound project under this chapter for such fiscal year that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) did not apply for assistance, or applied but did not receive assistance, under this section in fiscal year 2007; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) receive a grant score above 70 on the applicant's application.</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Boxer amendment is to provide additional funding--$57 million for Upward Bound Programs. Upward Bound Programs are special programs, formed by colleges, to help students who come from lower income families and who are first-generation college students, and who have capacity and capability to continue on to college. It has been enormously successful. What has happened is there are applications submitted by Upward Bound Programs in order to get a grant. Depending on a variety of  different factors, those grants are either approved or not. They are scored and then either approved or not. The cutoff time at the present time is 92 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Boxer amendment, with an increased authorization which amounts to approximately $57 million, will amend the Upward Bound scoring to say that any quality program above 70 on the most recent grant cycle would be eligible to receive funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a valuable and worthwhile effort. I have a chart which shows what the results of the Upward Bound Program have been. Nearly 90 percent of Upward Bound students graduate from high school compared to only 68 percent of all low-income 18- to 24-year-olds. We have gone through other charts that showed, even if they graduated, those who will be qualified for college. Nearly 70 percent of Upward Bound students attend college compared to the lower rate of 54 percent for all low-income students.  Fifty percent of Upward Bound students attend a 4-year college compared to other low-income students. Upward Bound students are four times more likely to earn an undergraduate degree than students from similar backgrounds. This shows what all of us believe, and that is, all students can learn. They may learn at a somewhat different pace or a different time, but they can learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have seen is for a number of different reasons, we find particularly that those who are from the lower income families are either discouraged or, because of the costs, because of the application, the system is skewed against them. We are seeing that education, rather than being a factor which is uniting our country, is adding to the disparity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most effective programs, of course, is the TRIO Program. Within the TRIO Program is the Upward Bound Program. So Members are very familiar with this program. We all have programs in our own States. I have many in my State--over 50 TRIO programs in Massachusetts. I have the list here, and there are programs in just about every single State. These programs are out there and are working and providing important opportunities for students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is just an authorization, but it is an important one. It is targeting the group of students who need that extra help and assistance. It is remarkable that the schools and colleges are so involved in trying to help secondary school students. We have the GEAR UP program, which our good friend, Chaka Fattah from Philadelphia, was the architect of, working through universities. I know in the city of Boston many of the high schools are tied into the colleges that work with these students.  It is a wonderful relationship. It is the way it should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These kinds of outreach programs try to help and assist many of those students who are the neediest and are facing a wide variety of different challenges, recognizing they, too, have dreams, hopes, and interests in terms of furthering their education. This is an extremely modest program, but one that is enormously valuable and has demonstrated, time and again, its success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, that is the Boxer amendment, and I do not believe there is objection to it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to voice my appreciation for the presentation that was just made to give people a fuller understanding of what this amendment does. I will make a couple of additional comments on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the problems that brings this particular amendment forward is the appropriators did not appropriate the money that would have provided for all of the people who got a score of 70 or above to receive a grant in fiscal year 2007. Perhaps that has to do with a lack of authorization or too low of an authorization. So this one is an authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an interesting process we have around here. We have the budget process, which is where the President sends us a bunch of recommendations as to how he thinks we ought to spend money, and then we revise it sort of the way we want to spend money, except the real revision is only in the caps. That is what a budget is, it is how much total money we get to spend. Then we have an authorization process, where the committees are involved in the actual legislation for that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, higher education comes under Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the HELP Committee. So we get to authorize, which says what we think ought to happen, kind of in a maximum sort of way. So this amendment does authorize additional funds that would meet the criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have some small concern. It says this would allow for those to reapply who did not apply for assistance. This is a competitive grant situation. For whatever reason, they might not have applied. If they did not apply, for a competitive grant, you simply do not get it. But I suspect that is something I will either better understand or we can make a correction on at a later time. So I do not have any problem with taking this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to emphasize that anybody who wants higher education ought to look at the programs that are available out there. One of the things we are trying to do is get more information to more people about what is available. We originally called it the TRIO Program because there were three programs that would help students--some in minorities, some in lower income situations. But we had three programs.  Now we are at eight programs, and we keep devising  ways so more kids can get more education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we need, of course, is for the kids to take advantage of the programs that are out there. I certainly would not want to stifle a program by not authorizing this at this point in time. So I encourage us to accept this amendment by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we know a college degree and a highly skilled labor force are the keys to increasing earnings and to Americans' competitiveness around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Senate HELP Committee began work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, my main priority at the time was to ensure that more students could access and afford college and job training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taken as a package, <bill type="s" number="1762">S. 1762</bill>--the Higher Education Access Act that we passed early Friday morning--and <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>--the Higher Education Amendments Act--that we are debating today--truly accomplish these goals and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early Friday morning, the Senate increased the maximum Pell grant award to assist low-income students to go to college or to get job training. Then we added additional funding for the neediest of low-income students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very proud that we authorized and appropriated $226 million for the College Access Partnership Grant Program. This is a partnership between the Federal Government and the States to help more young Americans prepare for, apply to, and succeed in college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also did good work in the bill in protecting borrower benefits that are provided by State agency and nonprofit lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Alaska, we have a State agency lender that uses their special allowance payments, or their SAP payments, to reduce the loan interest rates to the lowest in the Nation. They provide outreach and college early awareness to middle and high school students. They provide need-based grants and other very important benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaska's State agency, nonprofit lender, and others like it in States such as Wyoming, Tennessee, and North Carolina, are not plowing their SAP rate into their profit margin. I am gratified the Senate was able to recognize the good work the State of Alaska and many other States are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also in the legislation, we ensured that young Americans will not be saddled with unmanageable amounts of debt after they graduate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is these and other provisions in <bill type="s" number="1762">S. 1762</bill> that go hand in hand with the bill we are debating today, and which I am hopeful we will see passage of by tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>--the Higher Education Amendments of 2007--includes many important and beneficial provisions that will ensure that students, parents, and American taxpayers get the fairest deal, the best information, and truly the biggest bang for their buck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation makes the cost of college more transparent so parents and students can compare the costs of different colleges to determine which ones will most effectively and affordably meet their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It places prohibitions on unauthorized entities using students' loan and grant information for marketing purposes. It provides fair, sensible, and rigorous ethics reform for financial aid administrators and lenders to ensure that the students receive the information they need to make decisions that will benefit them and not benefit unscrupulous lenders or postsecondary institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II of the bill streamlines and strengthens Teacher Quality Enhancement grants to bring more accountability to university teacher training programs. It also directs the Secretary to further simplify the FAFSA the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. When we were talking on the floor last week about the FAFSA application, the Senator from Wyoming held up that eight-page application and demonstrated what it is the students are faced with when they take this on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly proud of one provision that I worked to include in <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>. This provision makes it easier for servicemembers--particularly those in the lowest ranks--and their spouses to afford college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in my State at Fort Richardson last winter, and I was visiting with some of the wives of the servicemen deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. I asked them in this townhall meeting: What is it that I can do to help you as you wait for your loved one to return home? How can we make your lives better? We talked about quality-of-life initiatives. We talked about greater certainty with deployments. But one of the wives told me that during this time when her husband was deployed for 15 months, she  was trying to take advantage of this time period to better herself by going on to college. She told me that one of the things keeping her from being able to afford to go to college was that the money the military pays to help offset a portion of their housing costs, which is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I soon found out from the National Military Families Association that many military spouses are in this same position. So when I came back to the Capitol, I worked to include language in <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill> that would exclude the cost of the basic allowance for housing for servicemembers living off base, as well as the value of on-base housing, from being included in calculations for financial need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excluding the basic allowance for housing--which, in the vast majority of cases, does not completely cover military families' housing costs--and the value of on-base housing will benefit the least well-paid members of our military and their spouses. These are privates, they are seamen's apprentices, lance corporals, airmen, and corporals whose base pay is less than $35,000 a year. As those who are deployed and serving our country, we can help the spouses who perhaps are here and looking to better  themselves during this period of time as they wait for their loved ones to return home. This is a true benefit for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not be more proud to know that this strong woman whom I met last year and potentially thousands like her will have a better chance now of being able to attend college should we be successful in passing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I believe we did a fine job in making college and job training more accessible and more affordable. I would like to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, for their generosity and their graciousness throughout this long process and their true dedication toward the goal of educating all of America's young people.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if the Senator from Virginia will withhold, I wanted to thank the good Senator from Alaska. She has been a very active member of our committee. Besides her earlier amendment that was on income-based assistance to the students, she had a very worthwhile amendment that is going to make a big difference in her State and in all of our States in terms of making greater availability of information and outreach to students who are qualified to go to the schools and colleges  but otherwise would not be able to because of lack of information and support. That was a key element. Also, she has been very much involved in the grant program which is included in this for science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has been a very active member. We value very much her input and involvement in the legislation. We thank her for her comments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is entitled, "Minority Serving Institutions for Advanced Technology and Education," amendment to <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>, The Higher Education Act Amendments of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember in the 1980s, traveling to several of the historically--and they referred to them as "historically Black colleges" in the Commonwealth of Virginia, I noticed the absence of so much infrastructure in these struggling institutions that other institutions often had in abundance. Having had an engineering background myself, at my old school, Washington Lee University, we had laboratories with an abundance of equipment and all types of high technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suppose at that time the thoughts in my mind led toward this day, and it has been a long climb up the mountain--not by just this Senator from Virginia but by many, many Senators. I remember Senator Cleland was very interested in this, former Senator Cleland, Max Cleland of Georgia, and my colleague and former Senator George Allen of Virginia. Fortunately, today, with the two managers of this bill, the chairman and ranking member of this important committee, the HELP Committee, and with the  help of many others and the primary cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and my colleague from my State, Senator Webb, we are here this afternoon to present this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first ask unanimous consent that those Senators who desire to put in statements regarding this amendment of course may do so and that they be colocated in the Record following the introduction of this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it appears statistically that over 60 percent of the jobs in America, all across our land, require not only a basic knowledge but really an advanced skill in what we refer to as "information technology." Jobs in this area, frankly, pay and command higher salaries. Today, as I said, many of the minority serving institutions--this covers a wide group of institutions which I will address later in my text, but the minority serving institutions simply lack the resources,  the necessary capital, endowments, and all types of financing that go into these institutions to acquire the basic equipment, whether it is an actual computer itself, or the technology to hook it into systems, and they also need technology capabilities in their classrooms, dormitories and libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to bridge--and I use the term the "digital divide" to help students who want to develop the skills necessary to succeed in a technology-based economy so that they can compete in today's modern world and take these jobs, which, incidentally, are badly needed in the workforce, and therefore get salary and perhaps a step up on the ladder of development of their career. This is definitely a bipartisan amendment and, as I said with the deepest sense of humility, many, many Senators have  worked toward this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the legislation will establish, as I said, a grant program for these institutions of higher learning to bring increased access to computers, technology, and the Internet to their student populations. Institutions can use funds to acquire equipment, instrumentation, networking capability, hardware and software, digital network technology, wireless technology, and infrastructure to develop and provide these educational services. In addition, the grants can be used for such activities  as campus wiring, equipment upgrades, and technology training. Finally, Minority Serving Institutions could use these funds to offer their students universal access to campus networks, thereby increasing connectivity and making infrastructure improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, much has been said in this education debate about the importance of math and science education. I remember well, I and other Senators 2 years ago were authors of the SMART grant program, which provides stipends to economically disadvantaged students in their third and fourth year of college or university training who elect to study critical majors in math, science, and engineering and key foreign languages. We must now begin to encourage and provide for those students who want to start  earlier than their third and fourth year and begin to enter and study these critical fields, not only of math and science but of high tech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I point out, I remember very well when I came out of the Navy at the end of World War II, I had the GI bill, and I went to my university--a small one--and they had a very small engineering department at that time. The engineering department is now gone because it couldn't take the competition of larger schools. But I remember so well we would go into the laboratories in the afternoon and spend long hours. We didn't have any air-conditioning, so we opened the windows, obviously. You could hear  the other students out on the playing fields enjoying all kinds of sports and other things while we were there laboring over the laboratory requirements. Then, at night, of course, we all had the obligatory homework. It seems to me that those of us who were in the high-tech and the math--I was a math major and physics major--we would spend endless, long hours on our homework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I bring that up not to in any way eulogize myself and my career but simply to say that those students who want to dedicate that extra time to study in the high-tech world--and it does require extra time, thereby giving up some of the pleasures in life--we ought to have the proper equipment available for all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Science Foundation reports that the percentage of bachelor's degrees in science and engineering across America has been declining. Many a time I and other Members of this body have pointed out how America is falling behind, particularly with reference to India and to China, as such a higher percentage of their university graduates are following the high-tech careers. So let's give a leg-up to those young people who want to devote that extra time, that extra motivation in their studies  for these specialties in math, science, and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also addresses the shortage of qualified professionals that teach courses in these areas. You simply have to have not only the hardware within the institution but knowledgeable teachers and professors, and this amendment provides an inducement for their training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, I am proud to say that my great State is home to six institutions that qualify for this grant program. Throughout the years that I have been in the Senate, they have proudly been referred to as Historically Black Colleges and Universities, known as the HBCUs: Norfolk State University, St. Paul's College, Virginia University of Lynchburg, Virginia Union University, Hampton University, and Virginia State University. Right now, at this point, I thank all of the faculty and presidents  of those institutions and administrators who through these many years, year after year, have come into my office pleading for this modest program to help them put in the infrastructure and gain the teaching faculty to help the students who want to pursue these careers in science, math, and technology. Likewise, all across America, Minority Serving Institutions will</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the mid-1980s, on the campus of St. Paul's, my first thoughts regarding the growing disparity between Historically Black Colleges and other institutions of higher education with respect to the infrastructure began leading up to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senate has addressed similar pieces of legislation in the past year. In 2003, a similar bill passed in the Senate with a roll call vote of 97 to 0. In 2005, a similar bill passed in the Senate by Unanimous Consent. So I am pleased today, together with Senator Kerry and Senator Webb, to offer this not only on behalf of ourselves, but the many Senators who through the years--some who have now retired--have worked hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I salute the faculty and presidents, and so forth, at these institutions and, most particularly, I salute the students who are ready and willing to seize the opportunity that this bill will provide to advance their intellectual skills to meet the requirements of today's workforce, so that America can be competitive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, for his excellent presentation, and also for reminding us about the importance of math and science and technology and engineering. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I think his involvement and focus on this is also enormously important because he understands that education is not only a value to the individual, not only a value to our economy, but it is an essential aspect in terms of our national  security. I have talked with him frequently about the National Defense Education Act that made such a difference in terms of availability. That was after Sputnik in the late 1950s, when the country came together and passed the National Defense Education Act. Still, some of those individuals are in key positions today in both private and public sectors. They are individuals who took advantage of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Defense authorization, Senator Collins and I had spoken to the Senator when he was chairman of the Armed Services Committee. We have the small program that is directly focused on math, science, engineering, and technology that he included in legislation in the past. We have a number of enormously interested young people who are taking advantage of those scholarships. We remember the amendments the Senator offered on the reconciliation that he referenced here previously. So this  is an area that he has shown enormous interest in and concern about. We are enormously grateful for his intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senator knows, we passed the COMPETE Act earlier this year. In that COMPETE Act there are provisions to assist these minority institutions. Quite frankly, there are a lot of other priorities in that COMPETE Act. I think the fact that the Senator has given us this legislation and this focus is incredibly helpful to us. I thank the Senator for all of his efforts. It is no surprise to me that my colleague and friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, is your strong cosponsor because  I have talked with him about this subject matter on many occasions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just draw the attention of the Senator to this chart, which I think makes the point the Senator pointed out. The bill provides resources for institutions to build capacity, develop facilities, and improve instruction; expands opportunities for institutions to serve more low- and middle-income students; supports greater financial literacy and strengthens the focus on studies in the STEM fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a pretty good summation of what the Senator is trying to do. I think it is enormously important that this legislation be included. Senator Kerry is very interested in this, as well as Senator Webb. I thank all of you for giving this focus and attention. This is a very important undertaking, very important legislation. I am grateful the Senator has taken the time to bring this to our attention.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend who has worked with me for these 29 years. Following Senator Enzi, I wonder if I may have 2 minutes on one other point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator, Mr. Warner, for his tremendous effort, and not just on this bill but on the previous bills where his emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math, has resulted in other grants that are available to students. We need to increase awareness among students of these opportunities, particularly in the lower grades, so they have the prerequisites they need to qualify for going to college. The Senator's emphasis on that has  had tremendous effect on higher education and on the work we have done before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the Senator for the comments he made about his staff working through the weekend and ours working through the weekend. This is not a 9-to-5 job around here. People don't realize the amount of dedication our staffs have. As I say, they work through the weekend for these students. It happened  to be a beautiful weekend in Washington, and they were indoors making telephone calls and making sure that everything works precisely right so we can pass this amendment today. I think we would be willing to take it on a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will provide up-to-date technology, which is vitally important. Everything is operating off of technology today. And I especially appreciate the concern for and emphasis on minority-serving institutions having this opportunity. There is a disadvantage there, and we want to equalize that. The Senator has caught the essence of that and has the solution for it. I congratulate him. It will strengthen the national and digital and wireless infrastructure. That helps all of us because it increases  national investment in that area and makes us all more communicative and to also have a greater ability for education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the kind remarks of the Senators. Mr. President, I will just tell a short story. Senator Kennedy mentioned the importance of this to the Armed Forces to have a pool of trained individuals to join the military today. I would like to contrast it to an early experience I had in life. In the winter of 1945, the war was raging in Europe--although it ended in May, it was still going on, as was the war in the Pacific. Like everybody else on  my block, all students who were 17 and 18, we all joined the military. I don't claim to have a military career of any great consequence, but I will never forget the first night. We had been on a small train that stopped in stations all across the east coast picking up a dozen or two 17- and 18-year-olds on the train. It was cold as the dickens, and the train was chugging its way up to the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We arrived at 2 or 3 in the morning. We were tired, cold, and huddled into a great big room. A petty officer, who was quite rotund, got up on a little platform and screamed at us, "All you guys who can't read and write raise your hands." I had the benefit of a wonderful education in high school. I almost flipped out. I did not realize, really, that many people didn't have the basic skills that I had been given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the petty officer said, "All you smart so-and-sos fill out the forms for the others." About 20, 25 percent of the fellows came out of the coal mines and steel mills of Pennsylvania and up through the valley, where the train went picking up these guys. So we filled out the forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say that those men had very short training once we got to the Great Lakes. The rest of us were shunted aside for technical schools. Within 90 days, they went aboard ships and right into the battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On those ships in those days there were dozens of jobs that persons who could not read and write could perform, and perform very well. In no way do I denigrate their abilities to fight, as they did bravely in World War II--those who could not read and write. Today's ship in the U.S. Navy--take a destroyer. The destroyers today are considerably larger than the destroyers of the past. But the crews are dramatically reduced in number, which means that every one of those naval persons today has to  have high-tech skills. It is true also in the Army and Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you visit Iraq and see the troops there, as most of us have, they are all working with high-tech equipment. There is no place available today in the military for one who is not skilled in high-tech work. So it is a changed society, albeit my story dates back more than a half century. They were fighters then, but in today's military we access those in the military with high school equivalent. The ones who show a technical proficiency are immediately moved into advanced technical courses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this legislation is laying the foundation for those in these institutions who so desire to join the U.S. military, and they will arrive on the first day not requiring a fellow soldier, sailor, airman, or marine to fill out their form. They are all smart and able to work with the high-tech equipment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Genius without education is like silver in the mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What he was saying is that silver still in the rock, in the ore, is worthless until it is mined, taken out of the rock. It is the same with education. Genius without education is akin to silver in a mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have, I am sure, a lot of geniuses who have not been educated, and that is too bad. That is what this legislation is all about. It is unquestioned that a college education is the single greatest weight on the scales of success. Yet today, more and more working-class Americans are shut out from the promise and opportunity of a college education because the price is out of their reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we took a significant step to restoring that promise to hundreds of thousands of American students by passing the bipartisan Higher Education Access Act. It should not go unnoticed that the $17 billion in new student aid and benefits represents the largest increase in college assistance since Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights more than 50 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we passed last week did this in a comprehensive way by increasing grant aid, expanding the number of students eligible for Federal aid, making loan debt more manageable, and expanding loan forgiveness options for those professions that we all recognize are important to society--teaching, social work, law enforcement, and health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, in considering the higher education amendments, we authorize remaining programs and funding in the Higher Education Act. This bill is not weeks overdue or months overdue, it is years overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this legislation addresses the recent student loan scandals. With provisions in the bill--increased disclosure requirements, prohibiting payments and gifts from lenders to colleges and financial aid administrators, and new restrictions on preferred lender lists--we are finally putting an end to these unacceptable practices and making sure the student loan system works in the interests of our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As importantly, we tackle the rising costs of college. Despite the billions in new student aid and benefits in the bill we passed last week, if college costs continue to rise at the rate they have been--tripling over the past 20 years--higher education will continue to remain further and further out of reach for too many Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support this legislation. I am also pleased students in Nevada have the good fortune of a State university system with some of the lowest costs in the Nation. But the same is not true everywhere, and this bill will hold colleges accountable if their costs increase too dramatically. It also ensures students and parents have information they need to make objective decisions based on the cost of college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill phases out the unnecessarily complicated Federal financial aid form which is currently 7 pages long--and probably more complicated than filing out a tax return--with a much simpler 2-page form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, thanks to Senators Kennedy and Enzi for the work they have done and the rest of the HELP Committee for their work in the formulation of this bill which, when combined with their efforts last week, reaffirms our commitment to making higher education affordable and accessible to America's students.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, we thank him so much for scheduling this legislation, both the underlying legislation we passed last week, which will make a difference to students, and the authorization. I know my friend and colleague from Wyoming, as well as others, knows we saw this authorization expire some 3 years ago. So this is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea that we passed both these pieces of legislation together is going to make a major difference, not only to the students, about whom we are primarily concerned, and to their families but also to the colleges and universities and to all the other entities in the educational community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are moving along with these amendments. We are very thankful for all the cooperation we have received this  afternoon. Hopefully, we are able to conclude this bill either late tonight or tomorrow. This will be a very significant and important time in terms of educational policy for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the leader very much.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, and my friend from Wyoming, we did not have time to do this legislation, but we had to take time to do this legislation. This is an example of how committees working together can get work done. Committees do a lot of work, but much of what comes out of the committees is done on a partisan basis. Democrats vote for it, Republicans vote against it. Frankly, we cannot get those bills to the floor. We  cannot get them done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat, we did not have time to do this legislation. We have so much to do. We have appropriations bills we need to do. As soon as we finish this bill, we are going to move to Homeland Security appropriations, which is essential. SCHIP legislation, we have to do that. We have to do the conference report on the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We have to complete the work we have done and gone so far down the road on ethics and lobbying reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an example, and I say this to all committees, to work together such as these two men have worked together and we can get things done. That is how we were able to get the Energy bill passed earlier. We took those provisions from the Energy Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Commerce Committee, on which there was unanimity, everyone agreed. I took those provisions and put them in a package, and that was the bill we passed in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Senator Kennedy mentioning my name, but the work was done by this committee last week and arriving at the point where we can have this legislation completed today. This is important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard Senator Warner on the floor today talking about when he went in the military. They had those who couldn't read or write during World War II raise their hand. Twenty-five percent of the people on the ship could not read or write. We don't have that situation today. But we do have a situation where there are many people, such as the example I gave, who have the intellect to have a college education and simply cannot do it. It is as  Benjamin  Franklin said, when the silver is still in the mine, it doesn't help anybody. When we have the people who have the ability to be educated who cannot be educated, it doesn't speak well of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to continue down that road of educating our students, and this legislation, tied in with what we did last week, is a giant step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again express my appreciation to Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the members of the committee for allowing us to get to the point where we have time to do a bill that we don't have time to do.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Purpose: To include Native Hawaiians as groups underrepresented in graduate education for purposes of the Ronald E. McNair postbaccalaureate achievement program)</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of section 403, add the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> (i) Additional Amendment to Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program.--Section 402E(d)(2) (as redesignated by subsection (e)(2)) (20 U.S.C. 1070a-15(d)(2)) is further amended by inserting ", including Native Hawaiians, as defined in section 7207 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and Pacific Islanders" after "graduate education".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our United States, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are far less likely than the average American to earn a bachelor's or graduate degree. This makes Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders drastically underrepresented in higher education. Unfortunately, Pacific Islanders are left with fewer opportunities to lift themselves out of underrepresentation because, unlike African Americans, unlike American Indians, unlike Alaska Natives, and unlike Hispanics, Native Hawaiians and  Pacific Islanders have been largely excluded from programs such as the McNair Achievement Program based on a determination that they are not an underrepresented group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The McNair program is designed to prepare young men and women from disadvantaged backgrounds who have demonstrated strong academic potential for doctoral studies through involvement in research and other scholarly activities. However, until the underrepresentation of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders is addressed, the promise of the McNair program to help the underrepresented achieve their dreams of higher education will remain only partially fulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a study conducted by the Pacific Islander Access project, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders have difficulty gaining access to programs for underrepresented minorities in higher education, such as the McNair Program. In fact, the study reported that more than 80 percent of these scholarship programs did not recognize Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders as underrepresented. This is due, in part, to a misconception that Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders  are not a distinct group but are, instead, an Asian subgroup. This misconception is, to a large extent, rooted in the Federal Government's policy from 1977 to 1997 to lump Asians and Pacific Islanders into one category. Fortunately, in 1997, this Federal policy was changed to recognize that Pacific Islanders and Asians are separate and distinct groups. However, many programs, including the McNair Program, have yet to catch up with this Federal policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is to our Nation's credit that we have developed programs such as the McNair Program in response to the needs of our country's minority students, and my amendment in no way excludes other underrepresented groups. Rather, this amendment simply ensures that Native-Hawaiian and other Pacific-Islander students are also allowed full access to the opportunities afforded the McNair Program, which has opened the door to an advanced degree for so many in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help young Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders achieve their potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank the chairman for his zealous attitude in which he has tried to help all those in the United States who need help in education, and I commend him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend from Hawaii for bringing this to our attention, this situation which works to the disadvantage of Pacific Islanders and specifically Native Hawaiians. He quite appropriately points out that other groups are included as underserved populations but the Native Hawaiians are not and the Pacific Islanders are not. In many respects, the fact that they are not able to participate in these programs works to the disadvantage of the population generally  from being included in terms of the life of not only their communities but the communities of our country. All his amendment does is to make sure they are going to be included in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is this program? This program is really a helping hand to those students who are going on to college--in this case, it would be the Hawaiians and the Pacific Islanders--a helping hand in counseling, giving guidance to these students so that they might participate in these other programs which offer real hope in terms of technology in the future. Effectively, his amendment says that Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians will be included so as to qualify for these programs in ways that mean  students, who otherwise would be excluded from getting counseling--the helping hand--could continue for graduate degrees. It seems to me they should be included, and the amendment makes a good deal of sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons and the excellent reasons the Senator mentioned earlier, I thank him for bringing this to our attention. I must say, I was not aware those groups had been excluded, quite frankly, from the program. I don't know how this originally happened, but we always learn a good deal from our colleagues here in the Senate, and we have learned a good deal about this issue today. As always, the Senator from Hawaii is out front when it comes to issues on education and opportunity for Native  Hawaiians and for Pacific Islanders, and we are very grateful to him for bringing this to our attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, we will accept this and make sure it is a part of the legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I, too, wish to thank Senator Akaka for bringing this to our attention. That is one of the reasons we have 100 people in the Senate and 435 people on the House side, so that we bring all these various backgrounds together, so that something which may have been overlooked can be corrected, and the amendment process is one of the places where we correct that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Akaka has said, this amendment would provide Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders with eligibility for the Ronald McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program, and that is a program which provides assistance to disadvantaged students who are pursuing doctoral degrees. The students in the McNair Program get research opportunities, they get seminars, they get summer internships, they get tutoring and academic counseling, and they get assistance in securing graduate admission  and financial aid mentoring. Those are all things, of course, which increase the probability and the possibility that a person will get their doctoral degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure it wasn't anyone's intention to leave these groups out, so this amendment, of course, would include the Native Hawaiians to the list of students eligible for this program. So, in his usual way of taking a careful look at things, I appreciate his doing this and enjoy all the times we have worked together on financial literacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think there is still someone taking a look at the exact wording on this, so hopefully we can get that done and get to a voice vote a little later.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Federal student aid is a tangled web of tax, grant, loan, and savings programs with rules and regulations that are so complicated, many prospective students don't know that they really can afford to go to college. Families have to fight their way through a maze of paperwork. We have talked about this several times, the difficulty of the present financial aid form. Nearly 10 million prospective aid recipients must file that form each year, and submitting the form is the  only way for families to determine their eligibility for Federal grants and loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The free application for federal financial aid is longer and more complicated than a Federal tax form. It has 5 pages and 127 questions, so it is longer than the form 1040EZ, which is 1 page and 37 questions for filing your taxes, or the form 1040A, which is 2 pages and 83 questions. It is comparable to the form 1040, with 2 pages and 118 questions. The contrast between the tax forms and the financial aid forms is especially informative. With a third of the financial aid form questions and a  fifth of its pages, the IRS captures the information needed to determine tax liability for the very population targeted by the Pell grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Financial aid officers and education specialists typically explain that the complexity of the form is a necessary evil, without which we could not target aid to students with the greatest need. The FAFSA, financial aid form, is long, it is argued, so that it can precisely measure who most needs aid. However, a few economists have recently completed research that measured empirically how much complexity in the current aid system contributes to its targeting. They found this complexity adds very  little to the targeting of aid to those who most need it. Only a handful of questions on the FAFSA determine eligibility for Federal aid, and most of these questions are currently found even in the 1040EZ, the tax form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response, a small but growing number of researchers, economists, and leaders in higher education have offered proposals to reduce the FAFSA to one page and to prepopulate a student's FAFSA with the data their families have already submitted to the IRS. Such an approach would reduce the time-consuming and confusing FAFSA paperwork which requires parents and students to report to one Federal agency--the Department of Education--data they have already submitted to another Federal agency--the  IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two North Carolinians--Senator Burr, on whose behalf I have submitted this amendment, and Erskine Bowles, who is the President of the University of North Carolina System, teamed up in the belief they could make applying for financial aid simpler and easier. President Bowles knows simplification of Federal applications is possible. As Administrator of the Small Business Administration in the 1990s, Erskine Bowles reduced the inch-thick SBA loan application to one page.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a conversation between the two this spring, President Bowles put together a task force across the State of North Carolina and gave them 90 days to come up with a one-page form which made better use of data parents had already reported to the IRS. This June, President Bowles delivered the mockup of this one page to Senator Burr. So North Carolina showed we can and should work more rapidly to simplify the process of financial aid, both by reducing the length of the application and  making better and more efficient use of data parents have already submitted to the Federal Government through their IRS forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would mention we have had a task force, largely my staff, who has been working on reducing it. We have it down to a one-page form. But Senator Burr's amendment speeds up the time we study included in the higher education bill, so the relevant offices: Education, Comptroller General, Treasury, Office of Management and the Congressional Budget Office and representatives of higher education and State higher education executive officers who have a demonstrated commitment to simplifying  the application for financial aid, report back to Congress in 1 year, how we could simplify the application and make even better use of data parents have already submitted to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's students and parents should not have to wait any longer than necessary for simplification. One stage of simplification should not preclude another stage of simplification. We do want to see that those who need the money the most have the highest priority. We want that to be done as simply as possible, so it doesn't discourage people from applying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate this amendment to try to speed up the time to do a further simplification of FAFSA. I am pretty sure there are no objections on the other side of the aisle. We will leave the time open for further debate on that as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, for several years I have been looking at the question of student loans and the abuse that often exists in that process. Also, another issue that has concerned me is America's lack of physicians in numbers sufficient to meet our current demands and the demands we may have in the future. So I have an amendment today that, hopefully, the bill managers, Senators Kennedy and Enzi, might feel comfortable supporting. It deals with both of those issues,  I think, in a way that takes us in a positive direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Association of American Medical Colleges, after the recommendation of Dr. Jordan Cohen, their president a couple years ago, recently stated it is their official policy that medical school enrollment should be increased by 30 percent. Most American medical schools are now already beginning to increase enrollment, some at about the rate of 15 percent, which can be done in most colleges without great expense. But as you get closer to a one-third increase, it actually begins to put a bite on  people's programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have to have faculty, perhaps buildings, and other capabilities that may incur substantial costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that has concerned me--and I am not sure most Americans are fully aware of it--is that a shortage of physicians is being filled by an increasing number of graduates from foreign medical schools. Many of these are offshore schools in the Caribbean--for-profit schools. Many of them don't require test scores to get in, and they are not up to the standard of American schools. That is a fact. We have the finest, most magnificent medical schools in the world. We have a tremendous  teaching and training program. We have some of the best equipment any schools could imagine in our country. So it is a special thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I have been concerned that perhaps we have been too tough on enrollment, requiring too high of test scores, sometimes denying good people with good leadership skills, such as class presidents and captains of the football team, who scored a little bit below someone who had a higher physics or  chemistry score, and they don't get in. So I think we need to expand the number of people who come into medical school, and we ought to be open to qualities  that are proven to further medical success, frankly. So I am concerned about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interesting development I have discovered that goes to the question of our Federal dollars and how we are supporting medical education is indicated by this chart. It deals with the number of loans certified for U.S. residents who are attending foreign schools. In general, whether you are going for a semester abroad to Italy or Brazil or England or wherever, this shows that during the 1993-1994 academic year, there were under 4,600 loans, and ten years later there were over 13,000 loans. That  might make one think this is a good thing, that more Americans are taking a semester abroad, as is common in a lot of schools. They encourage students to take a semester abroad, and it is an enriching experience--maybe even a year abroad. One might think that is what that issue deals with. But let's show what is happening here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at this chart. Of the 13,000 students who attend foreign schools, about 9,000 of those are attending foreign medical schools. About 75 percent of the total study abroad loan volume of 2003, or about $170 million--and I am sure that number has gone up--is now for loans to students who attend foreign medical schools. That is a rather shocking number and a dramatic number. It comes from a GAO report, dated July of 2003. That is a matter I would call attention to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about these loans? Are these people attending top Paris medical schools or what? Look at them in terms of the volume of loans, first. Let's look at No. 1, the No. 1 school in the world where students receive U.S. Federal loan money is a medical school in Dominica. They only have one medical school on that island in the Caribbean, and they receive $35 million in loan volume, with 1,700-plus students receiving loans to go to that school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next one in volume is Grenada. Remember during President Reagan's presidency, when we had an invasion of Grenada, where we had American medical students and their safety was of great concern to us when that invasion took place. Grenada has one medical school. It gets $30 million and has 1,500 students attending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third country to receive Federal loan money for medical school is Mexico. They have 11 schools and they get $27 million. England is fourth. They have 182 schools in England, but they only get $25 million in student loans, and they have quite an advanced medical program there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next school on the list--the next country is the Dominican Republic, another island school. The Dominican Republic has six schools, and they receive $20 million in student loans each year. The next one is St. Maarten, another Caribbean island, $16 million. Next is Canada. We would think that would be up there at the top, would we not? Canada, our neighbor. Canada has 108 schools and they get only $15 million. The next one is another island school in the Caribbean, St. Kitts, they have two  schools and they get $14 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that begins to show the problem we are dealing with. I would suggest we need to take some real interest in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have offered an amendment that would deal with it. I send my amendment to the desk, as modified, and ask for its consideration.</paragraph>

FOREIGN MEDICAL SCHOOLS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Percentage Pass Rate.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) IN GENERAL.--Section 102(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)(bb) (20 U.S.C. 1002(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)(bb)) is amended by striking "60" and inserting "75".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) EFFECTIVE DATE.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall take effect on July 1, 2010.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Study.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) complete a study that shall examine American students receiving Federal financial aid to attend graduate medical schools located outside of the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) submit to Congress a report setting forth the conclusions of the study.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) CONTENTS.--The study conducted under this subsection shall include the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) The amount of Federal student financial aid dollars that are being spent on graduate medical schools located outside of the United States every year, and the percentage of overall student aid such amount represents.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) The percentage of students of such medical schools who pass the examinations administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates the first time.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) The percentage of students of such medical schools who pass the examinations administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates after taking such examinations multiple times, disaggregated by how many times the students had to take the examinations to pass.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) The percentage of recent graduates of such medical schools practicing medicine in the United States, and a description of where the students are practicing and what types of medicine the students are practicing.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) The rate of graduates of such medical schools who lose malpractice lawsuits or have the graduates' medical licenses revoked, as compared to graduates of graduate medical schools located in the United States.</narrative>
  <narrative> (F) Recommendations regarding the percentage passing rate of the examinations administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates that the United States should require of graduate medical schools located outside of the United States for Federal financial aid purposes. &lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>So to briefly summarize what the amendment does, it attempts to deal with this issue in a balanced but effective way. It seeks to protect taxpayers' dollars from subsidizing foreign medical schools that are failing to show positive results, and we have a way to determine which ones are showing results. Currently, in order to qualify for student financial aid, we have a rule in effect. That rule is that the foreign medical school must show 60 percent of its graduates pass the Educational  Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates' Examination. This is a test you have to take after you graduate to become licensed to practice medicine in the United States. So, currently, that rule is 60 percent. This amendment would raise the bar from 60 to 75 percent, to be implemented in 2 years' time. It would give them 2 years to prepare for this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is a reasonable change because approximately 90 percent of U.S. medical school graduates pass medical licensing examinations on their first attempt. That is a big difference. It is indisputable that the test failure rate is indicative of the quality of the instruction that one receives at a school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the next 2 years, prior to implementation of the new 75-percent standard, the amendment also requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on the amount of Federal aid going to offshore medical schools, the percentage of foreign medical graduates who pass the examination on the first try or after multiple attempts, the percentage of recent foreign medical school graduates practicing medicine in the United States, and a description of where and what type of medicine they  are practicing and asking for recommendations for the examination passage rate the United States should require of foreign medical schools who wish to qualify so that they can receive U.S. Federal student aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also modifying the amendment by adding a portion of the study to examine the rate of malpractice lawsuits and of lost or revoked medical licenses from graduates of foreign medical schools as compared to graduates of U.S. medical schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the study we have, the GAO report, would involve this. It would examine what is happening with students of foreign medical schools after they leave in order to determine how effective the schools are. While many of these schools likely do a pretty good job, and some I think do, there is no way to know for sure, as they are not licensed or accredited by any American entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many foreign medical schools do not use cadavers--do not use cadavers--but instead have students perform procedures that would be done, preferably on  cadavers, by simulation on a computer. I don't know about you, but I don't want a doctor operating on me who has been practicing using a mouse and a keyboard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, an article in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review earlier this year quoted Dr. Cameron Wilkinson, medical director of Joseph N. France Hospital in St. Kitts and supervisor of clinical rotations for two medical schools on the island as saying this--this is at St. Kitts in the hospital there, the training school, and he said this: "No medical school here would have a cadaver."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: "It would be great," but he explained the schools in the islands aren't equipped to work with them. This was in reference to a school on the island that was actually found to have cadavers for clinical instruction, but they kept them in black bags in an unsterile, unlocked, air-conditioned room. They were not following protocol for the use of cadavers and lacked the necessary documents to have them shipped from the United States. They also did not smell like formaldehyde, which is  one reason I didn't go to medical school, having gone into a place where something was kept in formaldehyde. But that is a great concern, as formaldehyde preservation is standard procedure for institutions that utilize cadavers in medical research. Thus, this school was handling cadavers inappropriately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this story also makes clear that schools on the island, for the most part, never use cadavers. Many of these schools do not even require that students take the MCAT; that is, the Medical College Admission Test. Standards at some of these schools are much lower than standards at American medical schools in regard to MCAT scores and GPAs--grade point averages--if they have those requirements at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Association of American Medical Colleges states that about--get this--this is the Association of American Medical Colleges. They have found that about one in four physicians practicing in the United States today, and about one in four physicians in training in the United States today, are foreign medical graduates. This is a remarkable statistic, when we have this magnificent medical school system in our country. We have gotten out of sync.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These foreign medical school graduates are, in many ways, needed to fill the gaps that currently exist in the American medical school education system. In June of 2006, as I said, the Association of American Medical Colleges recognized this shortfall and formally recommended a 30-percent increase in medical school graduates by 2015. That expansion would allow for 5,000 new medical students each year beginning in 2015.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would note that the U.S. population is increasing by 25 million each decade. The number of people over 65 will double by 2030. We expect more and more out of health care. We must have additional medical physicians, and we need to increase our own system and reduce the amount of money, taxpayer money, going to medical schools that are below par.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to urge that the Senate accept the Senator's amendment. It has been a number of years since our HELP Committee got into looking at the foreign medical schools, as the Senator pointed out. I think there are a number that are exceptional and incredibly good. Others are moderately good, and there are others that don't pass muster. It is, I think, useful to get that kind of information. We have a health care crisis. Personnel is a key aspect of the health care  crisis. We have a concern about what the specialties are in different areas in this country. The amendment the Senator is offering is going to help us understand what is happening with these foreign medical schools. The amount of financial aid they receive--we ought to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator has other references in here, too, in terms of the number of times to take the exam and medical licenses that are revoked. I think it would provide important information, certainly, for our committee. We ought to have an update of information on what is happening. Also, I think it is important for the American taxpayer to understand what is happening as well, in terms of this kind of investment, so I thank the Senator. This is an important area. We have, as the Senator knows, programs  to provide medical personnel--this is related but not directly on subject--in underserved areas in the United States, which has worked quite well. That is not the target of this particular program. But it is important that we have this kind of information.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have remaining time on the amendments we have dealt with previously. I believe we have 15 minutes. I am glad to yield it to the Senator from Oregon. He wants to talk on another subject.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Wyoming for their thoughtfulness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is especially appropriate, since Chairman Kennedy and the distinguished ranking minority member are on the floor. Both of them have great interest and involvement in health care. I thought it would be appropriate to talk for a few minutes about the upcoming CHIP legislation, the legislation that deals with the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is so important to America's youngsters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a markup in the Senate Finance Committee last week and it passed out overwhelmingly, to a great extent because of the very important and laborious work done by Chairman Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, and also the senior Republicans on the committee, Senators Grassley and Hatch. I commend them greatly for their toil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to take a couple of minutes today to talk about the issue because the administration has indicated that at this point they would veto the legislation, which came from the Senate Finance Committee by a 17-to-4 vote. I  am very hopeful they will choose not to veto this legislation because I felt it was striking in the Finance Committee last week that Senator after Senator on both sides of the aisle, including Senator Conrad and Senator Lott,  for example--leaders of their respective parties on economic issues--they concurred that the system in this country is broken. The health care system cannot control the costs. Millions fall between the cracks. Administrative expenses are soaring. We have largely sick care rather than health care. This is something Democrats and Republicans alike agree on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has the view that one of the key changes that needs to be made is the Federal tax rules as they relate to health care. I share their view that these rules are a mess. But it is not going to be possible to get to the question of broader reform until you first get bipartisan cooperation on the urgent and immediate needs of this country's youngsters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, I came out of the markup last week very encouraged about the Senate's interest and desire, on a bipartisan basis, to move ahead to fix health care. I think the clear feeling in the Senate Finance Committee is that this country cannot afford to wait to fix health care. I know there are a lot of people, particularly in the media, think tanks, and others who think: Let's wait a couple of years for another Presidential election. Let's wait 2, 3 more years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is sort of the way it goes for the political class. But for people who are hurting in this country and businesses that are struggling to meet the health needs of their workers and are dying to offer them coverage and cannot afford it, I don't think it is acceptable to say let's wait around a couple more years. It strikes me as pretty callous to say let's wait for another election, when we have all those needs of workers and businesses in parts of the country where there have been tremendous  layoffs. They say: Well, they can wait a couple more years before anybody talks about fixing health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not what I heard in the Senate Finance Committee last week. I heard Senator after Senator--not just Senators Conrad and Lott but Senators Crapo, Salazar, and  other colleagues on both sides of the aisle--making it clear they share my view that the health care system is broken. Now, for the first time in more than 13 years, the Senate has an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to fix health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bennett, a member of the Republican leadership, has joined me in legislation--the Healthy Americans Act--that has been able to pick up support of labor and business. We have structured it so all our citizens can get health care coverage, such as their Member of Congress does, through the private sector, at no greater cost than we are spending as a nation today. The bill has been put together so workers and employers win with the very first paychecks that are offered. I don't  see why America should wait any longer to fix health care. What we should be doing is building on the important work of Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, Senators HATCH and ROCKEFELLER and move to get CHIP passed in a bipartisan way and meet the immediate needs of this country's youngsters and then move on to do what I have heard members on both sides of the aisle on the Finance Committee call for last week and that is to fix American health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is--and you and I have had a chance to talk a bit about it, Mr. President--the system we have today was largely designed more than 70 years ago. It was set up after World War II. There were wage and price controls. Our troops were coming home. We wanted them to get good benefits. So we put it off essentially on the employer, and the Tax Code would change to make that possible. Well, a system designed for the 1940s surely doesn't make sense for 2007, when the typical worker changes  jobs seven times by the time they are age 35.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current Tax Code is regressive and it promotes inefficiency. If you are a high-flying CEO, you can get a designer smile put on your face and write off the cost of that operation on your taxes. But if you are a hard-working woman in a furniture store and your company has no health plan, you get practically nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my sense is, when the administration talks about changing the tax rules for health care and you look at what Senators were saying in the Senate Finance Committee about the system being broken, there is a pretty good opportunity to work in a cooperative way--not 2 or 3 years from now but to move forward in this session of Congress. To make that possible, it is going to be essential for the Bush administration to back off from this threat of vetoing the children's health program and to work  with Members on both sides of the aisle so that this legislation can get passed, and it would be possible, on a bipartisan basis, to move on to fix our health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot to work with. Certainly, we have seen great interest at the State level. A number of States are already moving forward with innovative programs. Mr. President, as you and I have discussed, no State can fix problems they didn't cause. No State can deal with the regressivity and inefficiency of the Federal tax rules on health care. No State can deal with Medicare. No State can deal with what is called the ERISA Program, the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act, with respect  to large employers and multiemployer programs. No State can deal with that. We are going to have to have bipartisan action at the Federal level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been very pleased that Senator Bennett has joined me in this bipartisan effort. My sense is there is something of an ideological truce coming on health care. We see a lot of bipartisan cooperation. Today, in fact, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, and Chairman Kennedy are cooperating on issue after issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bennett and I have said on health care that Republicans have moved a long way on coverage. We recognized that to fix health care, the people who are uninsured cannot just keep passing the bills on to people who are insured. We have to cover everybody, and Republicans have acknowledged that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats, on the other hand, have been making it clear that they do not think we can just turn it all over to Government. We cannot turn everything in health care over to Government and expect everything to come out well. We have to have some private choices, choices in a fixed market, where insurance companies cannot cherry-pick and just take healthy people and send sick people over to Government programs more fragile than they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to fix the private marketplace, but there ought to be choices in the private sector. That, too, is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to work with the Bush administration once we get beyond the question of the children's health program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am convinced that we are right on the cusp of being able to move forward on health care in a bipartisan way. In the other body, the Healthy Americans Act that Senator Bennett and I have been working for in the Senate will be introduced this week on a bipartisan basis. So that would then mean the Healthy Americans Act would be the first bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation to fix American health care in more than 13 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colleagues are going home every time there is a recess and talking with folks at home about health care. People are saying we know the system is broken and it is not enough to try to just take one small part. We really need to step back and make changes, for example, in the employer-based system which is hurting the competitiveness of so many of our companies. We need to have some health care rather than sick care because the system is biased against prevention. We clearly need to help those  who are falling between the cracks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, we have to contain the costs. The costs are rising, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, at far in excess of inflation, estimated to be about 12 percent this year. There is no way that is sustainable. It is not sustainable when we look at today's population trends and costs and the disadvantages our employers face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very pleased last week that not only was the Senate Finance Committee able to pass the CHIP legislation on a 17-to-4 basis through the hard work of our bipartisan leadership, but I was impressed because so many Senators on both sides of the aisle said  they want to go further and to fix a broken health care system. To do that, we are going to have to work in a bipartisan way. We are interested in working with the Bush administration on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I and others have said we can have differences of opinion with respect to how we straighten out this mess of a Tax Code as it relates to health care, but by and large, the administration is onto the key issue. To do this, we are going to have to recognize, first, that America cannot afford to wait any longer to fix health care. It is not enough to say let's just deal with it after the next election. That is not enough for people who are hurting in Virginia and Oregon and Wyoming. They want to  see action in this session. That is what they give us an election certificate to do, to act on big issues and not just put them off for another 2 or 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let us work together, Democrats and Republicans, in this body with the administration to pass the children's health program and then to continue that spirit of bipartisanship and fix American health care in this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have made very good progress during the morning and early afternoon on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We have a pretty good idea now of the remaining amendments. We are getting in touch with our colleagues who intend to offer those amendments. I expect we will have votes, as the leader indicated, in the early evening, and this probably will necessitate that we will have a few votes in the morning tomorrow. But we will wind up this higher education  reauthorization bill, which is really the good news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time remains?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has 8 1/2  minutes remaining on the bill.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise when I have 1 minute left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, I want to review again exactly where we are on the two pieces of legislation, one of which we passed on Thursday night, which is the historic increase in the need-based grant aid, the largest increase in grant aid since the GI bill after World War II. We have also assisted in the management of these loans, the indebtedness, by offering loan forgiveness and by putting a limit on loan payments at 15 percent of the discretionary income. Discretionary income also takes into  consideration if there are children and, obviously, that reduces the discretionary income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the loan forgiveness for borrowers who work in the public service jobs. If you become a teacher and work with special needs children, or work with the disabled or the elderly, and you do that over a 10-year period, you will not pay more than 15 percent and qualify for the loan forgiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also protects working students, so that if they work hard and gain some money to be able to buy some books, that they are not going to break through these caps, need-based caps, and they are going to be able to buy the books and use those earnings. This is a realistic and important aspect of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is assistance to the neediest students, assistance for those students from working families with middle income, and assistance for idealistic students who want to work in public service. All of that is going to be possible under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the reauthorization, the other part which we are now on the floor of the Senate debating, we are also making sure that the student loan system is going to meet the ethical requirements and is going to ensure that the best interest of the students and the loan system is going to be protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had too many stories of inappropriate kinds of actions in the development of the loan system, which makes it more difficult for the students and, obviously, compromises the colleges and universities. So we have addressed that issue in this part of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are publicizing the cost information so that parents will understand and get real information as to what the cost is for the schools. We are going to also publicize what the States are providing. If they cut back, as they have in my own State, which has meant the fees have gone up, parents will know who is responsible. We hope this will make a difference in terms of the total cost of education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The application itself, what they call the FAFSA, we have simplified that so it will no longer be a discouraging document. It will be one that will be easier to read and be easier to utilize, particularly for those students who don't have the kind of support systems that help them fill out those forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we have helped in the areas of the GEAR UP and TRIO programs to help improve preparation for higher education. For one reason or another, some students need a helping hand to continue their education and succeed in school. That has been true for the TRIO and GEAR UP programs and other programs that work with children who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds but are talented and hard working students. This helps provide an outreach for those students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, we have the programs to support higher quality teacher preparation. We understand at the end of the day the teacher in the classroom is the one who makes all the difference. Each and every one of us in this Chamber can all remember our favorite teachers, the one who inspired us, helped us, coached us, and really encouraged us to move ahead and grasp the opportunities of furthering our education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a very meaningful piece of legislation. It represents the best judgment of Republicans and Democrats alike. We are enormously indebted to our Republican and Democratic colleagues and all of the staffs who have worked very long and hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to have more to say on these particular amendments, but I think it is useful to just give a summary of what this legislation is all about. We have added to this legislation over the course of the day in some very useful and meaningful ways. So we are going to look forward to getting a good vote on the final passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a teacher amendment. Teachers are the most important factor to a child's academic achievement. Student achievement will not improve unless we can ensure that all children have access to qualified teachers. Many of our schools, however, are lacking in a steady and ample supply of qualified teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current state of affairs for high schools and middle schools is especially troubling. Nationally, 24 percent of all high school classes are taught by teachers lacking in either a college major or minor in their field of teaching. However, for students in high-poverty schools, this number jumps to 34 percent in comparison to 19 percent in low-poverty schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 50 percent of math classes in high-poverty high schools are taught by teachers with neither a major nor minor in math or a math-related field, such as engineering, physics, or math education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schools and districts for too long have been forced to depend on teacher pipelines that are not producing sufficient numbers of qualified individuals to teach in high-need areas such as math, science, foreign language, special education, and English language proficiency, and in hard-to-staff schools both in urban and rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bipartisan Commission on No Child Left Behind, led by Tommy Thompson and Roy Barnes, though concentrating primarily on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, recognized the critical connection between higher education--colleges of education--and K-12 education, for improving the supply of qualified teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one of its recommendations, the No Child Left Behind Commission recommended amending title II of the Higher Education Act to require institutions of higher education that prepare prospective teachers to set annual goals for increasing the number of prospective teachers in shortage areas, such as math, science, special education, and instruction of limited English-proficient students, and for more closely linking the instruction colleges of education provide prospective teachers with the needs  new teachers will face in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the Commission recommended having institutions of higher education provide an assurance to the Secretary that, No. 1, teacher training responds to the needs of the school districts and States in which new teachers graduate; No. 2, regular education teachers are provided with training in teaching diverse populations, including special education students, limited English-proficient students, and low-income students; No. 3, prospective teachers receive training to teach in urban and  rural schools; and, No. 4, special education teachers receive training on instruction in content areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Burr's amendment puts into statute these important Higher Education Act recommendations made by the bipartisan, nonpartisan No Child Left Behind Commission. Senator Burr, on whose behalf I offer this amendment, and I share the belief we must forge stronger connections between higher education and our K-12 schools and that higher education has a responsibility to ensure that the pipeline of prospective teachers grows and responds to the needs of American students and  schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All our children, regardless of background or neighborhood, must have access to high-quality teachers. So I am going to urge everyone to support this important amendment, which is offered by Senator Burr. This amendment requires teacher training programs to report to the Secretary of Education on how they are responsive to the needs of their graduates once they reach the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased this amendment recognizes the special skills new teachers need when teaching in rural areas. Today's teachers need training to meet the needs for diverse student populations--ranging from students with disabilities to English language learners to gifted and talented students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this amendment does not impose additional mandates on institutions with teacher training programs. It simply requires them to report on how they are meeting the needs of prospective teachers in local school districts, and I am sure they are working on that on a daily basis to figure out how they can meet the needs in the best way possible. Sharing that with us will help us in our work. So I ask that we adopt the Burr amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from North Carolina for offering this amendment. I had the opportunity to travel to North Carolina and to visit with their education department about their innovative and creative ways of trying to bring in highly qualified teachers in a lot of underserved areas. They have done a very good job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment doesn't surprise me. It is extremely worthwhile and reminds us of what the current situation is. If you have math students in high-poverty schools, they are more likely to be taught by out-of-field teachers. That means that over 33 percent of the math classes in high-poverty schools are being taught by a teacher without a degree in their field compared to less than 18 percent in low-poverty schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we have discussed during this entire debate, both last week and this week, this is a good example of our efforts to reduce the inequities in education, particularly when we are talking about the needs of developing skills in math, in science, engineering, and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a pretty good indication, the fact that if children are going to high-poverty schools, this is the chance they have to learn from a well-qualified teacher. It isn't always the case, but these statistics demonstrate the point the amendment is trying to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is in science. If you take science students in high-poverty schools, they are more likely to be taught by out-of-field teachers. It is 56 percent in the high-poverty area, and only 22 percent in the low-poverty areas. This is repeated in other subjects as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, what the amendment is trying to do is hold institutions of higher education accountable for the quality and progress of teacher preparation and alternative certification programs. We have serious need for math and science teachers, especially in low-income and high-need schools. We ought to be encouraging our teaching institutions to help produce those teachers. That is really a very substantial part of what this amendment does. It helps high-need schools recruit and retain  high-quality teachers so we give encouragement to schools to produce these teachers, and then help the high-needs schools to recruit and retain the highly qualified teachers and also help promote innovative models such as induction and teaching residency programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen that some of these programs have been enormously successful in retaining teachers in high-poverty areas. These programs also encourage more accountability in teacher preparation. That is very consistent with what we are trying to do in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Burr has spoken of this issue. The Senator from Wyoming, you will remember, spoke about this during our discussions in the committee. We indicated a desire to work with him. This legislation is right on target with what we are attempting to do, recognizing what I said previously, and that is the key to education is the well-trained teacher. This is going to be helpful to make sure we are going to have a well-trained teacher in those areas of shortage. Clearly, math, science and  engineering are very important, critical areas. As are teaching students with disabilities and English language learners. The amendment will help make this stronger legislation as a result of its acceptance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am more than glad to urge our colleagues to accept it. I will follow the lead of the Senator from Wyoming.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a couple of months ago a distraught mother from Cincinnati wrote me about the private loan her daughter had taken to go to college. Her daughter had borrowed $21,000, was facing a bill for over $100,000 as a result. She sent me the disclosure sheet on the loan represented in this chart because she could not believe what she saw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She took out a loan for $21,000 for 2 years of school. That loan grew, at an 18 percent interest rate, to almost $35,000 because there was a deferral on payback of the loan during her 2 years in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So she ended up owing $67,000 for the life of the loan. That is why she ended up paying $102,000 because of this incredibly high interest rate for student loan, 18 1/4  percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have shown this statement to a loan officer at a bank and also to my attorney. They both expressed to me they had never seen anything such as this and there must be a mistake. Unfortunately, the only mistake is Congress has failed to act to restrain the costs of these loans, which as we have seen, can carry interest rates sometimes in excess of 18 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not an isolated problem. Private loans have been growing at an annual pace of some 27 percent, meaning that because tuition continues to grow at a rapid rate, and the Federal Government has not met, through the Direct Student Loan Program or the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, has not met that increase, the amount that students need has grown at such a rapid rate that private lenders have come in charging interest rates similar to this, 18 percent, 16 percent, 17 percent, whatever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of college has climbed so much that we have seen this kind of growth. In Ohio, the median house income increased 3 percent between 2000 and 2006. Tuition went up 53 percent at 4-year public schools, 28 percent at 4-year private schools. Tuition went up 28 percent for some, 53 percent for others. Yet the average wage in our State went up only 3 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal loan limits have barely budged over the past several decades. In 1972, a freshman could borrow $2,500 in Federal loans. Last year, that number barely moved to $2,600, even though, in real terms, the limit on borrowing would amount to $12,000, if it kept pace with inflation. To be fair, the law changed this month. A freshman can borrow $3,500 for school. But even though the limits in the first 2 years have been increased somewhat, the overall cap on borrowing remains the same, $23,000  for a dependent undergraduate. This bill does nothing to change the cap because the HELP Committee decided, correctly in my view, the bulk of savings we could achieve should be plowed back into Pell grants. I applaud Chairman Kennedy for doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the price tag for 4 years of college at $120,000 for private schools, $50,000 for public schools, there is obviously a big gap for many students.  That gap gets filled in many ways: savings, work, grants, PLUS Loans, credit cards, you name it. But for more students, private loans are playing a bigger role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to testimony before the Banking Committee last month, Sallie Mae made $7 billion in private loans and $15 billion in Federal loans. In other words, one out of three college student loan dollars originated by the biggest student lender in the country is a private loan subject to much higher rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this chart indicates, the private loan program may well outstrip the Federal program over the next decade. What we have done on this chart is use the growth rates of the two programs over the past several years to predict how large they will grow if current trends continue. The darker reddish-purple there is the unregulated private bank loans that students are getting, growing more than 20 percent a year. You can see how within 7 or 8 years, they will overtake student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More and more students are forced to go through private banks for private loans at higher and higher interest rates every year. Think about these numbers: A 28-percent increase in tuition over the last 6 years for private 4-year institutions, 53 percent for public 4-year institutions. Yet the average wage has only gone up 3 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress very often legislates through the rear-view mirror. We wait until a problem becomes close to unmanageable before we feel compelled to act. Today we can take a different approach. We can act to address a problem before it becomes widespread. This amendment I am offering will create an alternative for the fastest growing segment of the student loan industry, private loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment creates a supplemental loan program that would be run by the Federal Government. It would provide one more option for students to finance their education. Over the years, my Republican colleagues have defended the private guaranteed student loan program by arguing there should be competition between the guaranteed and the Direct Loan Program and that the competition made both better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now there is no competition for these private loans with the results that students have been charged in excess of 18 percent.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would be glad to, if the Senator would yield on my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it not true that there is sort of three major components of paying for the cost for higher education? We have one aspect of it, which is the student loan program, which is the Federal student loan program. Included in that program is the authorization program, that we are going to deal with this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have the private loan programs which the Senator from Ohio is addressing. So as we are on the floor of the Senate, and middle-income families are watching us, we say we want to do something about the cost of tuition, certainly we make a downpayment on that in the reconciliation bill, where we have taken some $17 billion out of the lenders in order to provide more Federal grant aid to needy students. We have helped the neediest students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Senator from Ohio has put his finger on what is happening at the other end; that is, the dramatic increase in the students borrowing at these exorbitant rates of 18 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the Senator share my belief that we will never get a handle on the cost of tuition for colleges and universities until we get a handle on that program as well?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think that is exactly right, what Senator Kennedy said. Because of the efforts of Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, in a bipartisan effort in this body last week, to move money that has been subsidizing those private companies into Pell grants and into better rates and better payback periods and all of that for students, we have gone a big part of the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But on this chart, as Senator Kennedy suggests, the dollars students will need continue to skyrocket, and the only place they can go is these private banks.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>So what you are pointing out is what has happened in the last 6 years; am I not correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, we also had a chart earlier that showed that increase of 20-plus percent, up until now, in real dollars. If the percentage increase continues, and there is no reason it would not, it will grow similar to this. But we have had several years of this already.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, the point I am making is this is a relatively new phenomenon that has taken place, correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>As we try to get a handle on trying to provide need-based assistance, we've seen a cutback in the proportion of grants compared to loans in Federal aid. We've seen the huge increase in Federal student loan debt--more and more students must borrow to afford a college education. At the same time we are seeing the explosion of private student loans, which often carry interest rates as high as 18 percent, which the Senator has talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the Senator not agree with me, if we are really serious about dealing with the cost of tuition for students, we ought to deal with all of those components? As I understand, the Senator from Ohio is doing that with his amendment, to make sure we are going to, as a result of his amendment, help the neediest students in terms of Pell grants, and we are going to get help managing student loan debt by offering loan forgiveness to those in public service and by capping monthly loan repayments.  We are using some $17 billion that we take from the lenders, and we are going to make sure that students will get the best possible loan--even if it's a private loan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct. We are not regulating the banks. We are simply setting up a program so that the Government will break even. It will not cost taxpayer dollars. We are setting up a program to compete directly with private lenders, which we are certain, as my Republican friends have said, with the direct student loan program, that competition will make both operate better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will briefly summarize the amendment and then reserve our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment requires the Secretary of Education to offer two types of loans, a fixed rate and a variable. Each type of loan would be offered for borrowers with or without cosigners. The Secretary would then have the discretion of designing the program to mirror other features offered by private loans such as delayed payment until after graduation or deferment for certain hardships. This amendment will clearly stop situations like this one from happening to a student, where a student goes in  with a $21,000 loan and has to pay $500 monthly for 179 times and ends up paying $102,000 for a $21,000 student loan. We will see a competitive situation which will save those students dramatic amounts of money, working with what Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi did last week on debt forgiveness, on the Pell grants--all that will absolutely matter for students.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is providing competition; am I correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>So this isn't just mandating. This is creating competition, if they want competition in this area; am I correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>This creates a competitive situation similar to what we have had since 1939 but for students who have to borrow money beyond the $23,000 limit. It doesn't regulate the banks. It doesn't tell the banks what to do. It simply sets up a competitive situation from which all of us will gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Wyoming.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. There are some statements that I would like to clear up a little bit. I would not want anybody to think that this is increasing competition. This is increasing Government price fixing. It is requiring the Secretary of Education to do the price fixing. She is the one who sets the interest rate, or he, as the case might be at the time it was put into effect. That is not the person with the expertise to know what kind of interest rate ought  to be charged on anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have objection because this amendment has neither been through the Education Committee nor the Banking Committee. This is something the Banking Committee would strongly believe should be in their jurisdiction. I am glad we are having the discussion because it is very important for people to hear that you can borrow money at 18 percent, $21,000, defer all payments for 2 years, and pay off the loan in equal installments after that and wind up paying $100,000. If you are buying a car at $21,000  and you have to pay 18 percent interest and you don't have to pay anything for the first 2 years, that car is going to cost $100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That comes under the subject of financial literacy. It is important for us to impress on young people today what the cost of interest means, what the cost of deferring interest means. There are people buying houses under that kind of a proposal right now. They are very surprised at how much they owe on their house. We are trying to do as much as we can in the bill on financial literacy. Part of that financial literacy would be to encourage the parents to have a home equity loan to provide for  the student, and that way it is deductible on their income tax. There are a number of different ways of doing this, but I don't think having the Secretary of Education determine an interest rate would intentionally bring down the cost of interest. Hopefully, we can get banks to be responsible on the interest rates they</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had some experience with this before. There was a tuition credit that was initiated in 1978 to solve a huge problem at that time. It was supposed to apply to both elementary and secondary education and higher education, but it was focused on tuition tax credits for parochial schools. Almost all of the public attention was on the higher education part of it. The Carter administration very quickly came up with a two-part plan, automatic Pell eligibility for every family if their income was below</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the problem with that? If we had a Secretary of Education right now, and they happened to set the loan rate at 9 percent, I am sure the press would say that was absolutely terrible. On the other hand, if it was a Democrat who set it at 9 percent, they would probably say it was great. But this was the case where the Government set the rate at 9 percent. What is the problem? It was a time when interest rates were climbing through the roof and were on their way to 21 percent prime. So there  was an incentive to borrow money at a fixed 9 percent rate, which is what the student loan interest rate was, and that didn't have to be repaid until after college when interest rates were going through the roof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So students borrowed the money, put the funds in a money market, and paid it back as soon as the repayment began, having made a tidy profit on the float.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other students borrowed money and used it to finance cars and other things unrelated to college. In fact, parents were encouraged to borrow and do home improvements and other things because they could get this 9 percent money from the Federal Government. The amount of money being borrowed jumped from $1.7 billion in 1977 and 1978 to $67.2 billion in 1980-1981, an increase of 265 percent in 4 years. Federal costs associated with student loans grew from $480 million to $2.5 billion which was also  growth of 420 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Brown-Sanders amendment, a student attending an expensive private college could borrow the entire cost of attendance, as much as $45,000 a year, on highly favorable terms. Repayment would, indeed, start right away, but if families have college money in the bank, they can pay off the loan gradually and earn on the interest, as they do, the same as we had a problem with before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also will encourage students to have their children borrow money for college rather than finance it through the PLUS loans or other mechanisms that would put the burden on the adults. In some cases, of course, parents will have the student take out the loans and would repay it for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am suggesting this is something we haven't reviewed enough to do yet; that it would put some of the present loans in jeopardy. We have been very careful in both last week's bill and this week's to be sure that there was some competition between direct loans and the private loans. But those were reviewed over a period of time, looked at with some history, and this one doesn't have the history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will vote against it.</paragraph>

  <narrative>July 23, 2007. </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR: On behalf of students and institutions of higher education we urge you to oppose the Brown amendment to create a new supplemental loan program and eliminate all federal student loan limits. We share the desire to help students avoid risky and expensive private loans to pay for college. However, by eliminating all limits on federal student loan borrowing, this amendment may allow states to pass on more of the cost of college to students.</narrative>
  <narrative>Federal Stafford loan limits for undergraduate students are currently set at $23,000 for dependent students and $46,000 for independent students. Students can borrow additional aid through the Perkins loan program and parents are eligible to borrow up to the cost of attendance through the PLUS loan program. Independent students, and in certain circumstances dependent students, are eligible to borrow PLUS loans when their parents do not. Despite the availability of federal student loans a growing  number of borrowers are turning to the private loan market to finance their education.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Brown amendment would create a new supplemental loan program designed as an alternative to these more expensive private loans. About 5% of undergraduate students take out private loans to finance their education each year. However, the Brown amendment would allow all students to borrow federal loans up to the cost of attendance minus other federal aid.</narrative>
  <narrative>By eliminating all federal loan limits, the Brown amendment could have serious, negative unintended consequences on state investment in higher education. Over the past decade states all across the country have cut funding for higher education or restrained funding increases when faced with tight budgets. States have compensated by increasing the cost of college to students. Making available such a massive source of new funds, without any limitations, may have the unintended consequence of facilitating  tuition increases in states across the country.</narrative>
  <narrative>We urge you to oppose the Brown amendment to <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>.</narrative>

    <paragraph>By eliminating all federal loan limits, the Brown amendment could have serious, negative unintended consequences on state investment in higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have a letter from the Financial Services Roundtable. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ROUNDTABLE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 19, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR: As the Senate considers <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>, the Higher Education Amendment of 2007, the Roundtable is writing to express our opposition to the amendment by Senator Sherrod Brown. The Financial Services Roundtable would urge you to oppose the Brown Amendment, which would ultimately be detrimental to student borrowers.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Brown Amendment would create a new federal-run student loan program, in addition to current programs that would offer loans currently being made by private student lenders. This new government system with the ability to borrow money at government rates would essentially supplant lenders offering private student loans. The policy implications of such a program are broad and the unintended consequences are numerous.</narrative>
  <narrative>The private market and competition most efficiently serve consumers. There are many lenders in the private student loan marketplace and competition among lenders benefits students. <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill> supports competition in the private student loan market, while the Brown Amendment eliminates competition.</narrative>
  <narrative>This expansive new government bureaucracy created by the Brown Amendment would drive private lenders out of the student loan marketplace. Students would essentially have no alternative to the federal government for student loans. The federal government is not able to respond to market demands like the private market and having one lender on which student must rely is potentially problematic.</narrative>
  <narrative>We urge you to oppose the Brown Amendment.</narrative>
  <narrative>Best regards,</narrative>
  <narrative>STEVE BARTLETT, </narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when we structured the arrangement between direct student lending and private lending back in the 1990s, when Senator Kennedy was chairman of the committee, there was considerable open dialog about the fact that we were going to set an even playing field where we would allow the marketplace, essentially the students and the schools, to decide who was going to win, who would be used more often, direct lending or the private market. That was the theory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Indiana, at that time Mr. Coats, and I worked on this at great length. We worked out an arrangement where this was the way we would approach it. But ever since then, or at least in the last year, there has been an attempt to tilt the playing field significantly toward direct lending and to make the Government the lender of first resort and last resort for most students, even though in most instances that has been rejected both by the students  and the education community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is just an extension of that effort and is arguably an extremely expensive extension because even though the scoring rules may reflect a zero scoring--and I am not sure it will--we know those rules don't adequately reflect the cost to the Government of having participated in these types of lending programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing now under this amendment is saying not only do you have these base lending amounts that are available under direct lending, but you are going to be able to borrow up to the full cost of your education. So it dramatically skews the system to favor direct lending and especially to allow students and parents, as has been pointed out by the ranking member on the committee, to arbitrage that money and encourages high cost schools to become even more expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things we have seen is that there appears to be a direct correlation between tuition going up at schools and federally supported lending and Federal grants being increased. So the students are not usually advantaged by this expansion of direct lending and, many times, grants. It is, rather, the schools that are advantaged, especially high-end schools which simply raise their tuition to absorb whatever new money is flowing in out of the Federal Treasury. It has become a fairly cynical  game on the part of many academic institutions, but it is exactly what has happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment needs a hearing. It needs to be vetted very aggressively in committee, as the Senator from Wyoming, the ranking Republican, pointed out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It basically, in my humble opinion, right up front, undermines three of the basic principles we should be trying to resist occurring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first principle is we not unduly tilt the playing field in favor of direct lending over private lending or private lending over direct lending. Last week's amendment, which I think took a significant amount of money out of the subsidy for private lending, was a good step in the direction of not allowing private lending to get an advantage. This amendment should not be passed because it gives direct lending an unfair advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it should not create an atmosphere where students are pushed toward higher income schools, higher cost schools, and where parents and students are allowed to basically game the system through arbitraging funds--borrowing at one rate, lending at another rate--assuming they had some other sources of revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, it should not encourage this process which is occurring out there of giving significant resources without any discipline to higher education facilities so they can then raise their tuition, at the expense of students who do not have these types of resources to pay these loans or who do not qualify for these loans and end up with education becoming more expensive simply because the higher education institutions see there is easy money out there to capture, and they do not have to be disciplined  in managing their education systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there are a lot of issues this raises--a lot of issues. Now, I know the basic goal of some on the other side is to move the whole thing to direct lending. Unfortunately, that has become the cause c&#xE9;le 2bre around here, and the purpose. Much like universal health care, they would like to have universal Federal lending policies around here. But the private sector plays a significant and constructive role in making college affordable for American students, and has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original agreement, which was reached in the 1990s to make the playing field balanced and fair and to keep it balanced and fair, is the way we should proceed. We should not be putting in place, out of the clear blue sky, a brand-new major direct lending program which will undermine some of the  major tenets and efforts we have undertaken in higher education lending.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time do the opponents of the amendment have?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair. I will close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know several things. We, first of all, know that my amendment sets up a competition. It does not set up, it does not run the system. It simply sets up a competition. It does not tilt the playing field. It makes the playing field even so interest rates will not continue to be at a usurious rate of 16 and 17 and 18 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know the Direct Loan Program works. We have seen the Government involved in the Direct Loan Program, as in Pell, as in Stafford. The Government, in fact, has negative subsidy rates of 7 percent and 4 percent. In other words, the Government has done these so efficiently that the Government either breaks even or actually makes money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know my amendment does not take effect until students have exhausted up to $23,000. There are other opportunities to get financing for college. It only goes there. It is not a new program that simply will take people in because it is tilted, as my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, says. We also know if we do nothing, as USA Today said: There is just one problem. The efforts short of this amendment would do little to rein in the fastest growing area of the market--loans that are not federally  backed whose rates can generally rise without limit. Bills in Congress would not affect rates on these loans, also often called private loans, until this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ranking member said he hopes the banks charge lower interest rates. The fact is--as the Senator from New Hampshire talked about gaming the system--the banks are gaming the system. That is why this woman from Cincinnati had to--on a loan of $21,000--pay $102,000 back, at 18 percent interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just want some competition. I do not want to see the easy money--the Senator from New Hampshire talks about the easy money. It is easy money for the banks. It is huge profits for the banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is really a decision that comes down to, are you going to support students in giving them the opportunity to go to school? This is not buying a car. This is not making car loans. This is providing an opportunity for a lot of students. It is their first chance to go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife went to college, enrolled at Kent State University 30 years ago. She was the first one in her family to go to college. She probably could not do that today because the loans and the grants are not available the way they were 30 years ago. She probably would have either not been able to go to school because she could not have put the financial package together or she would have seen a situation where she would have been burdened with such huge loans, huge debt when she graduated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is the choice, are you voting for students in this country--giving opportunity to middle-class students, opportunity to working families--or are you going to vote to support the banks so they can continue to charge these kinds of 15, 16, 17, 18 percent interest rates?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Consumer Bankers Association be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>CONSUMER BANKERS ASSOCIATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Arlington, VA, July 23, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR: I am writing to let you know of the strong opposition of the Consumer Bankers Association to an amendment that will be offered by Senator Brown to the <bill type="s" number="1624">S. 1624</bill>, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 2007. The Brown Amendment would create a new "Federal Supplemental Loan Program."</narrative>
  <narrative>The effects of this program are hard to ascertain as it is being proposed with little input from anyone involved with or affected by student financial assistance programs. There have been no hearings or other public discussion of this massive proposal. We understand that student and school groups oppose the legislation, and we urge you to read letters to that effect from their representatives.</narrative>
  <narrative>The loan program envisioned by this legislation would enlarge the government by tens of billions of dollars a year and represents an attempt to fully nationalize student lending, putting all responsibility for making and collecting tens of billions of dollars in new loans every year into the hands of the Department of Education and its contractors.</narrative>
  <narrative>A private student lending system already exists; it is competitive and serves the needs of millions of students every year. The Brown Amendment is attempting to replace this system with a government-only monopoly that will eliminate students' and parents' choice of lender. This will only put a stop to innovation and improvement while doing nothing about the high cost of higher education.</narrative>
  <narrative>We urge you to oppose the Brown Amendment to <bill type="s" number="1624">S. 1624</bill>.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to offer the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act as an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would create a targeted student loan repayment assistance program that will bolster the ranks of attorneys in the criminal justice system in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the need for this amendment is clear. Prosecutor and public defender offices throughout the country are having serious difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified attorneys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a recent survey, over a third of prosecutor offices nationwide reported problems with keeping attorneys on staff. Over 60 percent of prosecutor offices that serve populations of 250,000 or more reported serious problems with the retention of attorneys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story is the same for public defender offices. Another recent survey found that over 60 percent of State and local public defender offices reported difficulty in attorney recruitment and retention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When prosecutor and defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or keep experienced ones, their ability to protect the public is compromised. Caseloads become unmanageable, cases can be delayed or mishandled, crimes may go unprosecuted, and innocent defendants may sit in jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is it that prosecutor and defender offices are struggling to keep attorneys on staff? I will tell you one major reason: student loan debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 80 percent of law students take out loans to finance their legal education. The average educational debt for law school graduates in the class of 2005 was almost $79,000 for private school graduates, and $51,000 for public school graduates. Two-thirds of law students also carry additional debt from their undergraduate experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of this, it is not surprising that two-thirds of law students in a recent national survey stated that student loan debt prevented them from even considering a public interest or Government job--two-thirds of law school graduates. Of those dedicated law graduates who initially accept criminal justice jobs, many cannot stay. They just cannot afford to do so with the student loans they face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The higher education reconciliation bill we passed last week does much to address student loan debt in general for those who have already been in public service for 10 years. There is student loan forgiveness. There is a cap on how much a graduate would have to repay for a period of time, and at the end of 10 years there is student loan forgiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, unfortunately, it does not go far enough to address the urgent need to help our criminal justice system recruit and retain qualified attorneys.  We need a special solution to provide immediate assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment, the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act, is a tailored solution. My amendment would establish, within the Department of Justice, a program of student loan repayment assistance for borrowers who agree to remain employed for at least 3 years as State or local criminal prosecutors or as State, local, or Federal public defenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should point out that Federal prosecutors are already eligible for loan relief through existing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under my amendment, borrowers could enter into another agreement, after the 3-year minimum, for an additional period of service. Attorneys who participate in this program can receive student loan debt repayments of up to $10,000 annually, with a maximum over time of $60,000. Repayments would begin with the first year of service. But, remember, there is no repayment unless there is a pledge to work at least 3 years, and then an opportunity to come back for another 3 years. So a commitment has  to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program gives priority in repayment benefits to attorneys who have the least ability to repay their loans. It ensures a fair allocation of benefits among prosecutors and defenders nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If an attorney receives loan repayments under this program but does not complete the agreed-upon period of service, they have to pay back the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The John R. Justice Act is modeled on existing loan repayment programs that cover Federal executive branch employees and the Department of Justice. They have been demonstrated to be a great success as an attorney recruitment and retention tool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, a targeted loan repayment assistance program such as this one would make criminal justice careers more feasible and more attractive to qualified attorneys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say, this bill has passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee twice. It has strong bipartisan support. It was brought to me by the prosecutors and the defenders in our criminal justice system. As we read in the news about case after case where those in prison have had their prosecutions reevaluated, we understand that competent counsel is the bedrock of a good system of criminal justice. We need the very best attorneys on both sides of the table--prosecuting those who have been accused  of a crime and defending those who have that presumption of innocence in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has strong bipartisan support, with 38 Senate cosponsors. Companion legislation in the House passed by a vote of 341 to 73. It is supported by prosecutor, defender, and criminal justice organizations. I urge my colleagues to support their State and local prosecutors and defenders, and to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has, among others, the support of the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the American Council of Chief Defenders, the National Juvenile Defender Center, the American Bar Association, the Conference of Chief Judges, and the American Law Deans Association.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will defer to the chairman and ranking member as the sequence of amendments are considered on the bill. My amendment, I assume, is currently pending, but I understand if there is a different sequence both of these Senators would seek.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator being willing to allow us to go back to the previous amendment or on to another amendment. We have one more that will be presented on our side. I think there is another one that will be presented on the Democratic side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have to oppose this amendment. I understand the importance, the desire, but I would oppose it on the basis that we spent a lot of time last week doing this same thing. I appreciate the time the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, took to explain to everybody what we were doing in a very general way so we did not have to pick one profession over another profession so we could give some reduced loan repayments and then forgiveness to public prosecutors, defenders, teachers--a  whole category, a whole bunch of service sector people. There was a lot of support, although we spent more time debating that part than we did several other parts of the bill, showing there is some discomfort with doing that, but also support for doing that, but in a general way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we start picking out one particular area of Federal service over others, what we are doing is touching off a whole raft of people coming in with their particular public service and asking for the same kind of a reduction. Of course, if we do that for everybody, we have increased the cost considerably. We ought to start with the proposal that is in there, and after that works, make modifications to it, rather than encouraging every specialty of public service to come in and do that as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the Judiciary passed it. That does not surprise me. That is a special Judiciary category. If it were a category coming through one of the other committees that dealt with their committee, it would get that same kind of support. But what we tried to do is come up with a way we could have fairness between professions. Each of the professions we talked about have some special needs, and we would be able to encourage and incentivize people to go into those professions earlier, quicker, and  with less debt if we have this same kind of proposal for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we will resist separating the prosecutors and public defenders at this point in time when we have included them in other language with loan forgiveness. Although it is not as short a period of time as the Senator might like, I think it is what we ought to do at the present time, and we shouldn't be increasing the program and then leveraging everybody else at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Wyoming. I wish to make sure we understand what happened last week. It was a good thing. We basically kept the amount that all student borrowers would pay based on the income they receive. As I understand the bill that was passed last week, which I was happy to support, there is a cap at 15 percent of the discretionary income of graduate students for those loans that are either in the Direct Loan Program or consolidated into the Direct Loan  Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basically, what it means from the chart I saw is that students, instead of paying back $600 or $700 a month, might face half that amount they would pay back because of the limit they would pay each year of 15 percent discretionary income, which I understand to be gross income less 150 percent of poverty for the student or the graduate in that category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I have come back this week to offer this is because we are talking about a group of individuals who are in an exceptional circumstance. They are people who will face an even greater debt than most college graduates. In addition to their undergraduate debt, they have the debt of a law education, which, as I noted here, can be substantial--almost $80,000 for those who have gone to public law schools, and $50,000 for those in private law schools on top of their undergraduate debt. Then  we find that two-thirds of these students cannot seriously consider taking any job in public service or Government work because of the amount of their debt. So we have prosecutors coming in from all over the United States--and I would bet from your own State--saying: We are having some difficulties here. We can't attract the kind</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So even though the bill passed last week is a good step, it is not adequate to the task. These particular graduates face more debt--dramatically more debt--than ordinary undergraduates or even graduate degree students in America. We have a special need. I would say to the Senator from Wyoming, I guess you can argue that this is special interest because it deals with our system of justice, but I think we all concur that as legislators, we can pass the best laws in the world in the criminal justice  system, but if we don't have well-trained and competent lawyers prosecuting those cases on behalf of the people of this country, defending those charged on behalf of those who have been named defendants, then our system of justice will not work as well as it should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will concede that this goes after a special group, but I think there are special circumstances that warrant it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope the Senator will reconsider his opposition to this. As I said, it has bipartisan sponsorship because I think  people realize that if we don't do this, we will diminish this branch of our Government which is so important for our democracy.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Purpose: To certify that taxpayers' dollars and students' tuition support educational rather than lobbying activities)</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of title I of the bill, insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 114. DEMONSTRATION AND CERTIFICATION REGARDING THE ABSENCE OF PAYMENTS FOR INFLUENCE.</narrative>
  <narrative> Each institution of higher education or other postsecondary educational institution receiving Federal funding, as a condition for receiving such funding, shall annually demonstrate and certify to the Secretary of Education that no student tuition amounts or funds from a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement received by the institution were used to hire a registered lobbyist or to pay any person or entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any  agency of the Federal Government, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any Federal action.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for allowing me to offer this amendment. Everything I try to do is toward transparency in our Federal Government, because what you cannot measure, you cannot manage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple amendment. What we know is that in the last 7 years, the cost of a 4-year college education has doubled. It has gone from $2,700 to $5,800 at State universities. It has gone from about $10,500 to $23,000 at private universities. The costs have doubled. It is the only thing in this country that is rising twice as fast as the cost of health care. We ought to ask ourselves why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is very clear. What it says is if you are a university and you are lobbying Congress, you have to certify to Congress that you are not spending tuition money or other Federal money that you have gotten for a project for your students or for your university in terms of lobbying to get more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, by the way, was excluded from the lobbying and ethics bill we considered. I have some experience on it because last year, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, I queried 500 colleges and universities in this country, asking them about their earmarks. I asked them how they spent the money. The interesting thing is only 50 percent  of them replied, and of the 50 percent that replied, only half of them actually knew where the money went. The other half didn't dare reply, either because they didn't know where the money went or the money didn't go for the purpose it was earmarked. So we have a grave problem in terms of earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give my colleagues some statistics about what has happened. First of all, in 2005, $127 million were spent by universities to lobby our institution to get earmarks--$127 million. Divide that and see how many kids we could educate in this country with that amount of money that was spent on lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do know is between 1996 and 2005, the number of earmarks at the Department of Education increased by 29,375 percent. I wonder if that has anything to do with this marked increase of 14.5 percent per year in the cost of a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those earmarks--the overall cost of the earmarks came to a half a billion dollars a year last year--a half a billion dollars in earmarks. What we also saw--that was in the Department of Education. Then, separate earmarks for separate universities and colleges in the same time period increased from 369 to 1,964, up to $2 billion a year. Now, you would think that for $2.5 billion a year, we ought to be able to see where the money is spent. We ought to have transparency to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are several problems with our earmarking, and the biggest problem is we choose to pick winners and losers. When we do that on research and development at our universities, which are the ones we want to do it to, when we do it, we say that the peer review scientific community shouldn't have any input. That is what we are saying. Consequently, when we spend $2.6 billion on earmarking specific projects at universities, what we are doing is getting a whole lot less value for our money. What  we do know is if we let the scientists, through peer-reviewed guidance of scientific discovery, tell us where to go next, we will get two to three to four times return on our research than when I, as a Senator from Oklahoma, decide to earmark a specific research project at a university in the State of Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the question we should be asking--similar to the amendment of the Senator from Illinois--where is the money going to come from? The true deficit last year was $434 billion. That is not what we told the American people, but that is how much our debt increased, so that is what the actual increase in expenditures over the increase in revenues was. If I was a prosecutor, I would love Senator Durbin's amendment, if I owed the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the principle we should be thinking about is this: Why are we having trouble getting the best into the offices of the public defenders and the prosecutors? Because we don't pay enough. What Senator Durbin is attempting to do is a State function. It is an indirect payment. We are going to pay off loans, we are going to have loan forgiveness for this group of people when, in fact, the way we should be enhancing that is having States choose to increase reimbursement for people who fulfill  that very worthy task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are actually doing is jumping all over States' rights, because States haven't increased those fees, as they should, because they don't evidently value it the way the 38 cosponsors of the Durbin amendment do, and we are saying: Time out. It is not your responsibility; we are going to do it. It is the same type of thing we have in terms of earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is very simple. Certify to Congress, if you are getting Federal funds and you want more Federal funds in terms of earmarks or grants, that you are not going to spend that money or your students' tuition to come up here to get more money. What you ought to do is use your endowment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some very interesting statistics on endowment that I would like to alert my colleagues to so everybody can be aware. I commend to my colleagues a 2006 National Association of College and University Business Officers Endowment Study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The top 25 universities in this country have $178 billion in endowments. Now, if they earn 6 percent on that, that is $9 billion a year that they have funds available to them to do research with, or whatever else they want to do. If you take the entire group of endowments, which is some 20 pages long, what you find is a massive amount of money that is endowed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do people give to universities? They give to universities to secure their future because they felt rewarded by the gift they gave them of education. Yet we have almost $1 trillion in endowments in this country in universities, and we are saying we need earmarks. We need extra moneys. Fine. If we do need extra moneys for research, let's let the peer-reviewed scientific community tell us where to go. Let's put the research at the place that it is going to get us the best return, rather than  one that has the greatest  political pull. That makes absolute sense to anybody outside of Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it doesn't make sense if you are trying to get something for your university, and University X obviously has the expertise, but you want it at your university. So what do we do? We end up paying double. We are going to fund one that is not as efficient, not as capable, and not as successful at the expense of the university that is far more capable of doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of the university earmarks came about because it was stated they couldn't compete on the grant process; that the major universities--those top 25 research universities in the United States--could outcompete them all on grants. So we did some things when we doubled NIH funding. We did allow for things. What has happened is a pox on our house. We have gone to this large number of earmarks, 2,000 earmarks a year for universities, and we are not getting our money's worth for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come back to one of the reasons I would like for us to consider this amendment: How do you tell a student who is working a second job, who can't afford a tutor, he has borrowed student loans up to his gills and is trying to make it, that a percentage of his university's budget out of his tuition is coming up here to get another earmark that is not necessarily going to be efficient or not going to enhance or advance his education or her education?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is real simple. Transparency creates accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record four case studies--one from the University of Alaska, one from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, one from the University of Georgia, and one from Iowa State University--on what they have done with earmarks and how they have spent them. It is remarkable.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Lobbyist confirms that academic earmarks are indeed a "gateway drug on the road to spending addiction": Earmarks are the "gateway drug to the spending addiction." A lobbyist for one of the universities polled (the University of Alaska) agrees. According to a profile of this lobbyist in the Chronicle of Higher Education, "She equates getting earmarks to having a heroin addiction. `Once you start getting them, it's hard to let go.' " It's noteworthy that this same lobbyist advised her institution  not to respond to the Subcommittee's oversight request on the University of Alaska's past earmarks.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Martha Stewart, director of federal relations for the University of Alaska, is one who said her institution would not respond.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Stewart said she showed the Coburn request to the Alaska Congressional delegation, including the office of Stevens, whose clout as an appropriator and earmarker is legendary.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Answering the letter `would be providing someone with bullets to shoot you,' said Martha Stewart, director of federal relations for the University of Alaska system. She said she assumes that Senator Coburn would use the information to try to block Alaska's requests for earmarked projects--which she declined to describe--from appropriations bills for the 2007 fiscal year, which begins October 1."</narrative>
  <narrative>Lobbying for academic earmarks is on the rise: In 2003, it was reported that:</narrative>
  <narrative>"[T]he brisk rate of growth has outpaced almost all other sectors that pay for lobbyists. That has made higher education one of the biggest players on the lobbying scene in Washington, on a par with defense contractors and ranking ahead of some other large, influential interest groups such as lawyers, labor unions, and the construction industry, according to rankings compiled by Political Money Line, a company that tracks lobbying reports ..... By far the single biggest reason for the spurt  appears to be the appetite colleges have for pork-barrel projects. The burst in lobbying came at a time when Congress was quadrupling spending on directed, noncompetitive grants from $495-million to $2-billion. Such earmarks were rare 20 years ago, but the floodgates opened in the late 1990s."</narrative>
  <narrative>Even though universities claim to be lobbying innocently for general education funding increases, in fact, this lobbying is often for specific projects: In response to the Subcommittee's questions, a number of universities reported that the lobbyists they hire are to help them reach out to Congress for general issues related to academia and the need for more federal research dollars. But there's some evidence that schools are lobbying for specific projects:</narrative>
  <narrative>"The Chronicle collected and analyzed lobbying-disclosure reports for all colleges, universities, and other academic institutions for the 1998, 2001, and 2003 calendar years. ..... While the reports are supposed to state the purpose of the lobbying, the wording often mentions federal appropriations generally, not specific projects.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The reports do show that not all of the academic lobbying is for  earmarks ..... But at many colleges, officials don't feel compelled to pay lobbyists to spend lots of time on those and other policy issues because they know places like Yale and Rutgers are already making the case, as are higher-education associations like the American Council on Education.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Most institutions apparently prefer to concentrate their lobbying dollars on getting earmarks." [Emphasis added.]</narrative>
  <narrative>The resistance universities show to disclosing information about their lobbying activities suggests that they recognize the unsavory nature of this sort of spending. The Subcommittee specifically asked about the use of lobbyists to help obtain earmarks.</narrative>
  <narrative>The response--or lack of it--was surprising. Despite receiving taxpayer money for special projects, some universities were still unwilling to answer the question. Of the top 50 pork recipients for 2003, and the top 50 R&amp;D ranked universities questioned: 23 wouldn't respond to whether they retained a lobbyist--they simply skipped the question or did not write a letter response at all; 6 said they had "considered" hiring a lobbyist, but didn't respond whether they had actually hired a lobbyist  or not, and two said they had "no plan to retain a federally lobbyist at the moment"; 22 stated that they retained a contract lobbyist; 14 stated that they had not hired a contract lobbyist; and 5 stated they had hired a contract lobbyist in the past, but not at the time of their response.</narrative>
  <narrative>Which comes first--the lobbyist or the earmark? And is either actually a value to a student? At the University of Georgia--it's hard to tell. The university retains a lobbyist who seems to be an expert in the peanut and Vidalia onion industry, among other things, and the University has received federal earmarks for research on Vidalia onions and peanuts. However, because the University is hiding information on those particular earmarks, it's hard for students and taxpayers to judge the educational  value of the projects.</narrative>
  <narrative>In fact, the university tasked its lobbyist with responding to the Subcommittee inquiry. The response was sent from the email account of "C. Randall Nuckolls, Washington Counsel, University of Georgia, McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge LLP."</narrative>
  <narrative>According to the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org website, Mr. C. Nuckolls' firm, McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge, earned $160,000 in 2006 from its contract with the University of Georgia.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the University of Georgia also paid another lobbyist, Robert Redding, Jr., $40,000-$60,000 each year for the years 2000-2006. In 2006, the University paid $20K for the main university campus and $20K for the University of Georgia School of Agriculture &amp; Environmental Sciences. Robert Redding, Jr., also represents the Georgia Peanut Commission, the National Association of FSA County Office Employees, and the Vidalia Onion  Business Council, among others.</narrative>
  <narrative>In response to the question about its past earmarks, the university supplied the subcommittee with a three page attachment with the titles of only 9 earmarked projects from 2000-2006, the amount of funding, the funding agency, and a short description of the earmark projects. The total value of projects listed was $62.117 million. That's 9 earmarks reported, for the 7-year period from 2000-2006.</narrative>
  <narrative>However, the Chronicle earmarks database tells a different story. The database lists 53 earmarks distributed over just four of the years in that 7-year period, worth nearly $41 million to the University of Georgia. Information after 2003 is unavailable because earmarks grew so much that the publication no longer had the resources to keep track of them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Meanwhile, the Congressional Research Service has refused to conduct research in this area, despite repeated requests.</narrative>
  <narrative>Two earmarks the University failed to report to the Subcommittee come from the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) budget. One earmark, for $200,000 in 2000 was "for support above what the agency would otherwise have spent, to promote the availability of food in developing nations by educating leaders to manage natural resources." The second earmark, for $200,000 in 2000, was for "for support above what the agency would otherwise have spent, to improve the production, processing,  and marketing of peanuts in developing nations as a high-protein food source."</narrative>
  <narrative>Even when the university did report earmarks, it grouped them in vague categories, particularly those from the Department of Agriculture. The Chronicle database is more forthcoming about what the university merely described as "Ag special research grants." These types of earmarks come from a pork-slush-fund at USDA, and include the following for the University of Georgia: $16 million from 2001-2003 to conduct "research to combat fusarium head blight, or scab, a fungus that damages wheat and  barley"; $170,470 in 2003 to "develop the cultivation and marketing of grass-fed cattle raised in the Appalachian region"; $488,615 over three years for "research on predation by small mammals, such as raccoons and foxes, on ground-nesting game birds"; $657,000 over two years for "research on pests, soil quality, and water quality related to the cultivation of peanuts"; $800,000 over two years for research on the "quality of cotton fibers";  $493,000 over two years "to study the quantity of water used in agriculture in Georgia";</narrative>
  <narrative>That's 12 projects under one vague category reported to the Subcommittee as one item. What else is the University of Georgia hiding?</narrative>
  <narrative>When asked by the Subcommittee to provide a list of past appropriations from the year 2000 to present, and the amount of assistance received, Iowa State University apparently did not have this information available in any form that could be presented to the Subcommittee. The university asked for additional time to comply with the request, along with answering a few of the questions in the initial response.</narrative>
  <narrative>The university was granted more time by the Subcommittee to complete a response. Three months after the original request date, the university sent a second response letter, a notebook containing summaries of Iowa State University Congressionally directed funding 2000-2006 (minus the requested actual funding amounts), and 6 boxes containing, according to the letter, "540 published reports, studies, and other materials that had been produced throughout the requested timeframe."</narrative>
  <narrative>Quotes from second response:</narrative>
  <narrative>"I want to thank you for making this request, because compiling this information has proved very useful to the university. We have added this information to our own on-campus process of evaluation and review of federally appropriated projects. To that end, we took great care to make sure that we collected and reviewed all relevant information for our own purposes as well as your request. We regularly go to great lengths to assure the merit and value all university research, but I am also aware  of the importance of additional informed review. Following this letter is a compilation of the congressionally directed funding that Iowa State University has received from FY2000 through FY2006."</narrative>
  <narrative>The second response from Iowa State University was heavy on detail when it came to lists of published reports (provided only for some projects; others included far less detail), but not when it came to requested information. Only one of the 31 earmark summaries included in the notebook sent by the University contained a table breaking out funding streams by sponsoring agency for the earmark in Question. but even that table did not include the years the university received funding for the project,  and the table was rife with acronyms (a practice well known in D.C. and apparently also in the academic world) and therefore not easily decipherable. Only one other project included a paragraph describing the history and origin of the earmark, and some information on the funding stream, as well as details on significant oversight by the lead agency from which the funding originated.</narrative>
  <narrative>Despite the reams of paper provided by the university, The Chronicle database lists a significant number of earmarks which do not appear in the project summaries provided by Iowa State University. However, what is even worse is the university's lack of responsiveness on the funding for the earmarks they chose to highlight to the subcommittee: the total value of the earmark funding from the Chronicle database for the years 2000 through 2003, is over $83 million. Information after 2003 is unavailable  because earmarks grew so much that the publication no longer had the resources to keep track of them.</narrative>
  <narrative>In response to the FFM Subcommittee's oversight request, the university provided a list of 17 earmarks spanning six years, from 2001-2006, worth a total value of $17.7 million. The university included brief, one sentence "program objectives" for each earmark it listed its response. These cursory sentences do not answer the Subcommittee's request for detailed descriptions, findings and accomplishments for each project.</narrative>
  <narrative>According to the University, 8 of those projects were funded from earmarks handed out over the years 2001-2003 with a value of $6.975 million. However, in contrast, over the same timeframe, the Chronicle database lists 10 non-shared earmarks, and two shared earmarks distributed over 2001-2003, with a total value of a little over $14 million.</narrative>
  <narrative>According to data in the Chronicle earmarks database, for the three years 2001-2003, the university failed to include and report on the following earmarks funding 6 projects with a total value of $12.593 million. Without Chronicle data, who would know the difference--and who knows for the years 2004 through 2006 since information after 2003 is unavailable because earmarks grew so much that the Chronicle no longer had the resources to keep track of them. Here are the six projects: $3.5 million  over three years from the Department of Defenses for "Research on improving logistics management for the military and businesses, and to develop an executive-education project"; $223,537 from the Department of Defense in 2002 for "personnel, student internships, research, and other expenses to expand technological education and applications through its KnowledgeWorks Institute"; $2.4 million through NASA over 2002-2003 for "academic programs at the Science Discovery Outreach Center"; $4 million in 2002</narrative>
  <narrative>FFM Subcommittee staff received calls and faxed communications from the university's lobbyist, James E. Hyland, who helped to coordinate the response and who forwarded the university's first interim response via fax. According to the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org website, James E. Hyland, "Career Client List, 1998-2006," works for Greenberg Traurig LLP, which had a contract worth in $120,000 in 2006 alone with UNC.</narrative>

    <paragraph>I am trying to understand what you include that his amendment doesn't include.

I cannot figure out why, but it seems to. This doesn't stop it. What this says is they are going to just certify that the money they used for that wasn't their students'  tuition and other Federal dollars that were designed for another purpose and coming back against that. It doesn't mean they cannot pay a lobbyist or hire a lobbyist or that anybody in there government affairs office cannot contact us to lobby for a particular position, which is their right.

In your language you have on page 2, "any person or entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency of the Federal Government, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any Federal action." I am trying to understand this. Can a government affairs person at a university--I am a Member of  Congress--talk to me about support for the NIH and NIH funding?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hear what the Senator wants to do. I would be interested in where you get the $127 million. I will accept what the Senator says on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had thought, when we passed the Byrd amendment, Senator Byrd spoke very eloquently about what I think the Senator is dealing with, and that is lobbyists getting part of the action when they have the earmark. I thought that is the effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes further than that, but I am concerned about--and I have said this in my questions--whether you have a person representing a university or a government affairs person calling a Member of Congress about a lot of the matters that we are considering in this legislation, whether it is a student loan program or the NIH or whether it is the regulations that are guiding some of the education programs, the programs dealing with disabled student--let me ask you, how would this affect a university?  If there was a conference by one of the agencies--the Department of Education--and they were having a conference on the subject of higher education, can the university send any individuals there to express</paragraph>
    <paragraph>their views on education policies? Say they want to go down there and see more laboratories built because they want additional research, and they speak to the Department of Education about those kinds of items.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The Senator's responses are helpful. I don't know whether the Senator is familiar with the Byrd amendment. If it is not interfering with colleges or universities or institutions dealing with a wide range of educational issues or some of the fine schools that offer criminology wanting to call the Justice Department to try to get grants to deal with the problems of violence in the communities. But the Senator has given assurance that is not the area he is trying to get at. It is basically  the lobbyists. I don't know whether the Senator is familiar with title I of the Byrd amendment, which prohibits, as I understand it, a great deal of what the Senator spoke about with great eloquence in the earlier program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yes, I am glad to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="CASE STUDY 3: UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL">
    <paragraph>What we are trying to get is this. It is true that the Byrd amendment makes that illegal. The problem is that nobody has to certify it. So whether it is illegal or not, it is obviously happening. Yet we don't have any proactive basis going on at the universities for them to certify that they are not doing it. That is the difference between this and the Byrd amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="CASE STUDY 3: UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL">
    <paragraph>Just to continue, Mr. President, there are penalties with the Byrd amendment, civil penalties on the Byrd amendment. Maybe it is enforcement. The Byrd amendment says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of the funds appropriated by any Act may be expended by the recipient of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any Federal action described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then it goes on:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) The prohibition in paragraph (1) of this subsection applies with respect to the following Federal Actions:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(A) The awarding of Federal contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(B) The making of any Federal grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(C) The making of any Federal loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(D) The entering into of a cooperative agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(E) The extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Senator says this is pretty good language but not enforceable and he has ideas about how we can try to enforce it, I am certainly open to it and would welcome it. I don't have a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern was looking at the Senator's amendment and seeing that language talking about "to pay any person or entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of an agency of the Federal Government, a Member of Congress. ....." My office has frequent phone calls from universities and colleges, certainly as the chairman of the HELP Committee, particularly as we are dealing with this education issue--from scores of universities and colleges. They express strong views  about different aspects of this. We have heard a great deal from the lending institutions--Sallie Mae and the others--that have a direct financial interest in this. I think it is valuable to have clarity in this area so we know what is permitted and what is not permitted. These were some of the areas of concern that I had, and the Senator has been helpful.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="CASE STUDY 3: UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield, it put forth a parliamentary idea that the Byrd rule applies on bills consistent with reconciliation, if I am correct. What this is intended to do is proactively have--this does two things: It requires the university to know what they are doing, which is one of the things we found in my subcommittee--that they didn't know what they were doing. They weren't aware of where the money was going or how they were spending the money. It makes them look at that.  Two, it makes them proactively say they are within the law in terms of how they are spending the student money and the Federal money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the colloquy on this issue. I hope we have clarified the intent of the amendment. I am more than happy to accept a second degree that would clarify it more and that would give Senator Kennedy the safeguards he is concerned about. Nevertheless, there is a gigantic problem out there today, not the least of which is that it is hard to find in the Constitution where we should be earmarking $2.6 billion a year to private and State universities for education.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="CASE STUDY 3: UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator is quite correct. The Byrd rule applies to reconciliation. The Byrd amendment applies to this. Let me just say that I listened and there is much to what the Senator says. There are also some concerns. In 1980, we had, for example, a very good program to help colleges, large colleges and small, to develop research centers at the colleges and universities. What we had seen in our committee at that time was  the deterioration  of laboratories and research centers. We passed a very good bill. We had close to in excess of a billion dollars that was going out for peer review. That program was effectively eliminated. The budget cutters eliminated it. They eliminated the program but not the need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I haven't been very successful. I have done my best to try to help outstanding colleges and universities that are in need in terms of research, that are doing some of the breakthrough research, that are making progress in health and other areas, that are trying to get assistance. I am proud of that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share the view that in a perfect world, we have peer-reviewed science. There is a lot to what he says. In other areas, we do the best we can with the circumstances we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will take a look at what we have in terms of whether an amendment or clarification would be the best way to proceed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="CASE STUDY 3: UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Kennedy makes my point. In 1980, we had a program that was designed on merit, scientific, and peer-reviewed analysis. We had no earmarks then. Now we have 2,000 earmarks, and about 1 out of every 3 accomplishes something, and then not to the level of what it should because most of the money did not go to the best place to get the research done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator makes my point. We have a corrupted process in how we fund much of the money that goes to universities. Personally, the Senator from Massachusetts recognizes, I believe, that is not necessarily a legitimate role for the Federal Government, but it is one that is there. So if it is there, it ought to be transparent. We ought to be able to hold all universities accountable, and we ought to know where the money goes, how it is spent, and what money was spent to accomplish the receipt  of that money in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who vote against transparency like the status quo. You cannot fight against transparency. The facts are the facts. You cannot put a political spin on it. The facts will be the facts. The American people--actually, our American grandchildren, against whom we charged $434 billion this last year, ought to have the right to know where their money is being spent, and the devil is in the details on whether they are taking Federal money and using that Federal money to turn around to hire a lobbyist  to get more Federal money. That is a corrupt system, and transparency will clean that up.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this time to speak in favor of the Durbin amendment. I thank my colleague from Illinois for introducing this important amendment. It gives us an opportunity to provide for equal access to justice in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a problem today in our legal system, and it is the cost of legal education. The average attorney who graduates from law school will have $70,000 of debt in addition to the $16,000 of average debt in attending an undergraduate school. When you have that type of debt, it affects your career choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we want to make sure we get the best qualified attorneys going into public interest law, whether it is as a prosecutor or whether it is as a public defender. I think Senator Harkin will be here, either later tonight or tomorrow, to talk about the civil legal services, and the average starting salary for a legal aid attorney is $36,000 a year. For a public defender or for a prosecutor, it is not much higher than that. How can you possibly take a career in those fields and still  be able to pay off your loans?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Durbin amendment does something about it. It came through the committee on which I have the honor of serving, the Judiciary Committee. I think it is a well-balanced approach. I know we will probably have a chance to vote on this tomorrow--I don't believe we will vote on it tonight--but there will not be debate time available tomorrow, and I wanted to come to the floor and urge my colleagues to support the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Senator Harkin offers his second-degree amendment that deals with civil legal services, I hope this body will also support that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Maryland for his support. I might also say, during the course of the debate he raised an important issue--legal aid attorneys. These are attorneys who work primarily in the civil area, representing people of limited means. They are not very well paid. Many of them come out of law school facing debt on their own. We want to make sure that people, regardless of their economic status in America, have access to good legal counsel. So I have pledged to him--and  I renew the pledge--that if there is a way for us to help the legal aid attorneys as well as defenders and prosecutors, we should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in the best interests of our country to have competent counsel available for all Americans in terms of our civil and criminal justice systems. Think about how much we count on prosecutors to take the bad guys off the street and keep them off. We don't want somebody bungling a trial because of lack of experience or lack of skill. We want the best and brightest as prosecutors. Similarly, if the system is going to work and work well, there is a good attorney across the table defending the  person who has been  charged so there truly is a contest that is respectful of our judicial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same thing for legal aid attorneys. Whether they are representing people of modest means who are dealing with the daily drudgery of divorce or wills or landlord-tenant issues or small claims court, we want to make certain that those who are of modest circumstances in this country do not lose because the race always goes to the swift; that is, to those with more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Maryland for his commitment to this amendment and his general commitment to justice in this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for his leadership on this issue. I know he has been working for many years to get this accomplished, and I hope this is the vehicle on which we will get it done. I had the chance to chair the Maryland Legal Services Corporation and chaired a commission in Maryland looking to services for our population, and there are not enough attorneys who will handle poverty law. There are not enough attorneys who will handle public defender cases. It is difficult to get experienced  prosecutors today because you can go into a private law firm and make a lot of money, much more than you can as a public defender or legal aid attorney or as a prosecutor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator's legislation gives us a chance to say we want to make sure every citizen in our State has equal access to justice in our State. I applaud him for it. I think this is what we need to do. We have a chance in this bill to get it done. I thank the Senator for bringing it to the floor, and I support his amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In my hometown of Springfield, IL, we have an appellant defender program. These are young men and women who handle cases on appeal after the trials and work for a government salary. When I announced this amendment--that we had the possibility of student loan forgiveness--two young women came to the press conference. One of them said to me that she has plotted out how long it will take her, working as an appellate defender, to pay off her student loan. She said, "I will be paying  when I qualify for Social Security." That is hard to imagine, but it is a fact. The debt these young lawyers incur to get through law school, unless they are lucky enough to grab the brass ring and go to a big law firm, is so large that it haunts them for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether we are talking about appellate defenders or prosecutors or public defenders, I think we want to make sure these young people are spared some of this financial worry and some of this financial burden if they are willing to dedicate themselves to public service. That is what this is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a noble calling, and I have to recall it has not been but a few weeks since a Justice of the Supreme Court testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. This Justice came and said he thought the current pay for Federal judges was inadequate in America. That pay is in the realm of $165,000 to $200,000 or maybe more, certainly more at the Supreme Court level. We asked how much more he thought these Federal judges should receive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will take a minute. I understand we are getting ready to vote very soon. But I cleared this, of course, with Senator Durbin. He was fine with the second-degree amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment that I offered would be to provide for loan forgiveness for young attorneys who go into civil legal practice, legal services. Now, the Durbin amendment provides for loan guarantees for those going into prosecution, or I should say criminal work, prosecuting attorneys, district attorney's offices, that type of thing, which is fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also need them for civil legal attorneys, those who are going into legal services. They make the bottom of the ladder. I mean, even the district attorney's offices pay them more than legal services. So I think it is needed in both areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, with the costs of law school and with the need we have for legal services attorneys, this amendment is drastically needed. Right now, about 50 percent of the people eligible for legal services, which means they had household income for a family of four of $25,800 or less--$25,000 a year or less--only 50 percent of them were able to get help from a legal aid program. That is 50 percent of the people who actually went and sought help. You can imagine how many more there are out there  who, for one reason or another, did not seek the help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Estimates are that closer to 80 percent of low-income Americans have unmet civil legal needs. Right now there is 1 legal aid attorney for 6,800 low-income Americans. One legal services attorney for every 6,800 low-income Americans. Compare that to 1 attorney for every 525 middle-income Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, again, the key reason for this is the inability of the legal aid programs to recruit and retain attorneys. Given the financial realities, many law graduates who are able to take positions with legal aid leave after 1 or 2 years. One Midwestern program cited a turnover rate of 60 percent over a 2-year period of time, with an average tenure for new attorneys of 17 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what my amendment does is it builds on the existing loan repayment and retention programs for Federal prosecutors and 29 other Government agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Congress. All we are saying is, if we are going to do it for people who come to work here or the Department of Justice, why not for civil legal aid attorneys?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would provide for up to $6,000 a year in loan repayments. You would have to sign it, you would have to be at least 3 years as a legal services attorney to get that, with a maximum lifetime benefit of $40,000. The amendment authorizes up to $10 million to do this. We know how many there are. We are only talking about 1,200 nationwide. So we know it does not cost a lot of money, but it is sorely needed. Time and again, people who have unmet civil legal needs, whether it is child custody, divorce  proceedings, it could be landlord-tenant problems, these people do not have access to the civil legal system. Then they take the law into their own hands, they do something else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing good legal services to low-income people, we basically keep people from doing things they otherwise would not do if they had some legal help available to them. People get desperate. I can tell you this, that the strongest bulwark against domestic violence is legal aid attorneys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens is, when someone is in an abusive relationship and they need legal help and they cannot afford it, that is when you get problems. Now, I can speak about this from experience. I started out my life as a legal services attorney. That is what I did when I got out of law school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought it was a great opening. I thought it was a great thing to do. You get the cases no one else takes. You get people who are at the end of their rope. Maybe they have tried to get legal help and they cannot get it anywhere else. You are sort of the last hope they have for settling something civilly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you from my time as a legal services attorney, we had a lot of people who got in a lot of trouble simply because they did not either know we were there or they could not access the civil legal system. You have domestic violence. Some people go to jail. Or you have child custody battles that go on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had landlord-tenant cases where people are at the end of their rope, maybe they have a dispute with the landlord, they cannot get it resolved, so they sort of take the law into their own hands and do something rash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, while it is important to encourage young lawyers to get into criminal prosecution, I think it is equally as important for us to provide some help for young lawyers who want to be legal services attorneys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see the Senator from Vermont who has been a strong supporter of our legal services program. I know of his commitment to this. I yield to the Senator.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400357" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the Senator's amendment. If we are a nation of equal justice under the law, then low-income people must have legal representation. Legal aid does a phenomenally good job. In Vermont, the wage scale for legal aid workers is embarrassingly low. Any young person who graduates law school with the kind of debt we are talking about would find it almost impossible to work at a legal aid salary. We should be supportive of legal aid. I strongly support the Senator's amendment,  and I thank him for offering it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Vermont. Check with the American Bar Association, with the State bar associations; they all support legal services. They know this is one way in which we can provide, as the Senator from Vermont said, access to equal justice under the law. I can remember when I was a legal services attorney in the 1970s, the case files we received. I mean, there were so many. We were there late at night. We were actually working weekends on some of these cases. You feel that  maybe you are not serving their interest well because you have so many cases and so many case files.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the remarks of the Senator. I hope we can get good support on the vote for this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I don't intend to press this amendment this evening. I have talked to the Senator from Oklahoma. I would hope we would have a chance over the evening to work with him to address the substantive matter of his amendment. I don't intend that we will have a vote on that amendment this evening, but for the benefit of the membership, I wanted to be able to at least file this amendment. I have talked to the Senator from Oklahoma earlier, about 45 minutes ago. We had a good  conversation. He was working on some language. But we do believe that we are probably getting fairly close to a vote on the Brown amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We wanted to be able to at least indicate to the membership that there may very well be a vote tomorrow. Hopefully, we will have a chance to work through the evening and get a chance to work that amendment out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I offer this amendment is, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma that Federal funds should not be used for lobbying. That is the current law. I would support the clarifying language in the law that prevents it. But there are very important reasons for institutions to communicate with Members of Congress, and I am afraid this amendment would have the unintended consequence of restricting universities and colleges from advocating for research grants and protections for their students.  It would make it possible for universities to comment on Federal regulations of the Department of Education. It may very well have impact regarding communications with Members of Congress whether we ought to increase NIH funding. It would require that universities use private or foundation dollars to share findings with Congress, and this would especially harm small institutions, rural institutions, historically Black colleges, and other institutions with limited resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am worried that the Senator's amendment goes too far. It is important we make very clear that Federal funding should not be used for lobbying, and if we need to do more to ensure that it is enforced, I am happy to work with the Senator from Oklahoma to do so. That is what my second degree amendment does. It is a restatement that no Federal funds received by any institution may be used to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee or any agency, a Member  of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No federal student aid funding may be used to hire a registered lobbyist or pay any person or entity for securing an earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then it continues: Any person who makes a prohibited expenditure shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less and not more than a million dollars, and the Secretary of Education shall take such actions as necessary to ensure these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope as part of an enforcement effort, that we would get a statement or attestation of colleges that they are not using these funds and report back to the Congress if universities are not doing it. We will try to work with the Senator from Oklahoma, but I wanted to at least include that second degree as we work with him through the evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is where we are.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask for support for the Brown amendment. We know in the last 5 years the cost of public education has gone up for a 4-year degree 53 percent. We know the cost of private education for a 4-year degree has gone up 28 percent. We also know that wages have gone up only 3 to 4 percent for the average person during this 5-year period. The Federal Government is not keeping up with helping students get the opportunity to go to college. We have seen students have no alternative.  They have exhausted what they can do with Pell grants. They have exhausted what they can do either through the direct loan program or other federally backed programs. The fastest growing part of their student loan availability is going to private institutions with a 16- to 18-percent interest rate. This amendment is no cost to the Government. It competes with banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We reauthorize every 5 to 7 years the Higher Education Act. This is an opportunity we should not pass up. The problem is only getting worse. I ask for support of the Brown amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as Senator Gregg and I have both explained, this amendment is very problematic. It has not been to a committee. It has not been heard. There has been no vote on it. It creates another loan program. It creates a different loan program than any we have ever done because this says the Secretary of Education will set the loan rate and the requirements on it. We have never had that kind of a situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most problematic, the system of education in this country is successful because it is a partnership between the private and public sectors. This one moves it all to private. It off-balances the direct loan versus the private loan market. We should not be supporting this amendment. The Secretary is not in a position to make the kind of decisions this calls for. We do have to have a private market. This would eliminate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have a previous example of where this kind of loan was used back in the 1970s, but that was because the interest rates were about 21 percent in the regular market, and the Secretary set it at--well, it wasn't the Secretary, but the loan rate wound up being set at 9 percent. People borrowed it for everything except education.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi and the members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for their work on this bill. I have been around awhile, but I have not been in the Senate for very long, and we have been working on this bill since I came to the Senate, which was 4 years ago. It needed to be reauthorized some time ago. But similar to some other things, it has gotten a little better with age, and it is a very  good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we have been working on this bill for some time, I believe it has gotten better over time. It has a number of excellent provisions in it. There is one major concern I have which I intend to speak on. Let me say what that is at the outset before I begin to talk about what I like about the bill. My late friend, Alex Haley, used to say, "Find the good and praise it," and I can do that with this bill, but I do have one concern. My concern is the creeping regulation of higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the single most important thing we could do to help improve excellence in higher education in America, which is already pretty good--the best in the world--is to deregulate, not add more federal regulations. Unfortunately, with this bill, we significantly add to the stack of regulations that college and university presidents all over America have to wade through every year in order to accept students who receive Federal grants and loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk about some of the good things about this bill. In the first place, it was an excellent decision to separate this piece of legislation from the work we acted on last week--what we call the reconciliation bill. This reauthorizes the Higher Education Act for the next 5 years, and it has separate provisions which deserve separate attention. For example, it increases the amount of Pell grants from $4,300 to $6,300 over the next 5 years. Pell grants are for the lowest income students. They  don't help the middle-income families very much because the dollars don't get up to that level. Those families are eligible for other aid from universities and other grants and loans. But $6,300 for a Pell grant is a significant amount of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, if you go to Harvard, it doesn't come close to paying the cost, but if you go to the University of Tennessee, it pays almost the entire tuition for the year. In fact, if you go to the University of Tennessee with a Pell grant, you are very likely to show up with what we call a HOPE scholarship, which also pays for tuition. So you would start off with a HOPE scholarship of--I think the amount is about $4,000--plus your $6,300 from the Pell grant, if you needed that additional amount  of money. So the Pell grant would be increasing from its current level of $4,310 to $6,300. If there are families across the country who are watching our debate and thinking they can't go to college, it is important for them to know that the community colleges of America cost</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This decision to move up the Pell grant to $6,300 is a big help. I hope it sends a signal across this country to families without means that their son or their daughter may start their higher education, for example, at a community college for 2 years, living at home and paying a few hundred dollars and letting the Pell grant pay for the total cost of the tuition, the total cost of the books. So there will be zero charge for that family for 2 years, and then after 2 more years, go on to a State  University, where the tuition might not be very much more than the Pell grant. In addition, the Pell grants will be even larger for students who are majoring in math, science, critical foreign languages, and thereby encouraging students to pursue those fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress is taking a number of steps to try to refocus our country's attention on our brain power advantage, to make sure we keep that so we can keep our good jobs from going overseas. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi and Senator Frist last year changed the law and created the SMART grants to focus on our competitiveness, and the increase to the Pell grants do that significantly more in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this legislation, in an overdue way, recognizes the importance of a year-round Pell grant. Many people still have in their mind the idea of the traditional college student on the traditional campus. That life has changed. Many of the students who take Pell grants have to work. They are older. They may be moms going back to school to get the training to get a better job or a dad doing the same, and they may not have time to take the summer off, or that might not fit their schedule.  The way the law has been, they couldn't get the Pell grant, if there were, say, three quarters, they could only get it for two. This says that--and Senator Clinton, I congratulate her for working on this as well. A number of Senators have worked on  making the Pell grant a year-round opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also delighted about legislation I introduced, again with Senator Clinton, to expand Teach For America. Teach For America attracts some of the brightest young men and women in our country who have a passion for serving. There are many ways to serve our country. Some of our most valued are in Iraq and Afghanistan. Others are in the inner city helping children who haven't had a chance to learn to read, to learn to compute, and learn to have a chance in this country. As Lyndon Johnson  used to say, we want people to be equal at the starting line, but we need to help some people get to that starting line, and through Teach For America, young men and women can do just that. This will build a corps of young college graduates who will spend 2 years in those schools, and it will expand the group of influential alumni of Teach For America who care about our public schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I actually think that what may end up being more important about Teach For America than their service for 2 years in the inner city schools is that we will expand these young men and women who will grow to be the leaders of this country in a relatively short period of time. Then they will always have within their personal missions the idea of giving every student an opportunity to go to a first-class public school. Having a corps of Americans who value education and who value public schools,  especially, will do our country more good than almost anything I can think of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe we have the best colleges and universities in the world. We don't just have some of them, we have almost all of them. They have their problems, but we should recognize the asset that they are. One of my primary goals as a Senator is to relieve the burdensome, oppressive paperwork that the Federal Government places upon our colleges and universities, freeing up scarce dollars to spend on improving quality teaching and research rather than paperwork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The higher education system--and I want to be careful saying this because I don't want to drive anyone away from this idea--is a Republican's dream, a conservative's dream. We have 6,000 autonomous institutions. Some are public, some are private. Some are religious, some are secular. Some are historically Black, some are Native American, some are Jewish. Some are in cities. There is Harvard and there is the Nashville Auto Diesel College. There are 6,000 autonomous institutions that compete. We  don't give money directly to those institutions, for the most part. We give the money to the students, and students take those vouchers--one-half of America's college students attend our autonomous institutions with a Federal grant or loan that helps them to pay for college, and they are flat out vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced several times a Pell grant for kids, saying that is what a voucher is for K-12, but we will reserve that discussion for another day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since World War II, quite by accident, we have said to the world: Here is the way we organize our education. It is a marketplace of 6,000 institutions, where (1) colleges compete for students, (2) Government money follows those students to the institution of their choice, and (3) the Federal research money is, for the most part, competed for in peer-reviewed efforts. The rest of the world is scrambling to catch up with our system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In China, they are deregulating. In France, they are deregulating and creating a more competitive system and trying to emulate the model that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what concerns me about our Government's attitude toward higher education is the number of forms each institution has to fill out. I have a stack of forms this tall in my office. I didn't bring it here to the Senate floor. Every institution has to fill that out in order to accept students who bring with them Federal grants or loans, which are almost all of the students. That means the small church-related schools have to hire somebody else. They have to go through all that. The President of  Stanford--not a small, church-related school--said 7 out of 10 cents of every tax dollar is spent on complying with Government regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would it not be better if we allowed Stanford and the small schools and the Nashville Auto Diesel College, as well as Harvard, to use more of their money to help students and less to comply with paperwork?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With passage of this bill, we will require the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Aid to review regulations imposed under the act and report to the Secretary and Congress ways to reduce regulation, streamline procedures, and simplify for the benefit of students. That will be one small force moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would create a discretionary grant program for an institution of higher education to maintain a Web site that keeps track of Federal regulations that have an impact on institutions of higher education. A small, church-related college might only have to hire a person who spends half of his or her time keeping up with the rules and regulations because the Web site might have done it for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require the Secretary to develop an annual compliance calendar for disclosures required by the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions might seem not very important, but I can guarantee you, as a former president of a university, they can make a lot of difference. I would like very much to have spread out before me a calendar from the Government that said we have listed all of the rules and regulations and forms and papers that you have to file. That would mean I knew what it was and that would save me a lot of time in figuring it out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite that good news, I am afraid there are, nevertheless, problems in this bill. Currently there are 24 reporting categories and 74 reporting requirements with hundreds of data points. That is today, before this bill passes. My staff has identified 26 new categories and over 100 new reporting requirements imposed on higher education with this law, and that is even before the department starts its regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we can figure out a way to create competitive forces in favor of deregulation. It is as bad on our side of the aisle as it is on that side of the aisle. Very often, my Republican friends say, for example, prices at colleges have gone up, so let's put on price controls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts, they said we know what religious oppression is, so let's practice it ourselves. We are supposed to be for markets and choice and less Federal regulation. So let's apply that to Federal higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked on a number of provisions in the bill, and I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for permitting me to do that, working with others, including Senators Gregg and Reed, and I have worked on provisions that have been included that simplify the application form for students who apply for grants or loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, I worked with Senator Clinton to help allow students who have Pell grants to use them year-round so they can finish earlier and get back to work and back with their families, rather than the antiquated requirement that they may only use them part of the year. I mentioned the compliance calendar to make it simpler for colleges, and the Teach for America plan, which Senators Harkin and Reid and others have cosponsored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an accountability research grant and a state data system pilot project. I thank Secretary Spellings for agreeing with these. As a result of her study of higher education, which pointed out a number of important things, we do have a fine system of higher education, but it needs to be challenged if we are going to keep our advantage. I felt that the Secretary, in her recommendations, was going too far in federalizing higher education, whether it be transfer of credit provisions, or whether  it might be proposals mandated from Washington about student accountability. I thought that was a good goal but the wrong way to go about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Secretary Spellings has agreed to step back and focus instead on challenging our State boards of education and our college boards of trustees and our university presidents and our Governors and legislators to do their own on accountability. We are not going to kick it to Washington, DC, and let us conduct oversight of how they are doing their jobs, rather than to try to  impose more of the one-size or a few-sizes-fit-all ideas from Washington. A part  of doing that would be these new grants from the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we have provided grants from the Secretary to create new measures for assessing student achievement in higher education. There is a difference in the Harvard classics department and the Nashville Auto Diesel College. I mention that because Harvard classics might be the best department for classics. I know the Nashville Auto Diesel College is the best training for mechanics. There is no need for us to figure out what is the appropriate accountability at those institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With great respect to the chair and Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the Department of Education, the institutions of higher education know more about accountability in higher education. We ought to make sure they are doing their job, not try and do it for them from here.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Wyoming. Another example of what I would call the propensity to federalize education is to regulate the transfer of credit policy that individual institutions have. If we are going to have a marketplace, and if students are going to have choice, then it is the job of the students to find out from the colleges and universities what their rules are. Otherwise, we go to a European system or a Chinese system,  or a system like our K-12 system where we, knowing all, tell everybody what to do, what the transfer of credit policies might be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I strongly resist saying that the Federal Government ought not to have anything to say about whether the Nashville Auto Diesel College ought to be required to accept a transfer of credit from the Harvard classics department. I am not sure that a graduate or student in Harvard classics would know anything about a Nissan engine in Nashville, and vice versa. I am pretty sure we don't need to interfere with that, particularly if so much of the excellence in our system comes from this competition,  and these autonomous institutions and this marketplace that allows students, followed by Government money, to choose and allows researchers to compete to see who deserves the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my hope is that as time goes on we can have a serious discussion in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and in the Education and Labor Committee in the House about deregulation of higher education. We all have good ideas about what to do. Some will be voted on as amendments tomorrow. If we all impose our good ideas from here, then they add up to another stack like this, and our higher education system begins to be smothered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege of working at several levels in higher education. When I was president of the University of Tennessee, I had a lot of oversight. The Governor was chairman of the board. The legislature approved the largest share of money that I received. I had a board of trustees to which I had to respond. There was a faculty council to which I paid a lot of attention. In terms of student accountability, the professors graded students on a regular basis. The dean graded the professors.  The trustees, the president, the provost, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the Governor, and the legislature all had their say. There is plenty of supervision of higher education based on my experience. So we need to be careful. We have been wise since World War II with our loans and grants that half of Americans use to go to college to say here is the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the college is accredited, a student can take their choice. You may go to Notre Dame or to the community college down the street. You may go to the University of Tennessee or to Rhode Island. That is your choice, as long as it is accredited. Of course, some mistakes are made. I am sure that at the fringes some colleges are teaching goofy courses. Some schools are better than others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, we don't have any enterprise in America that today has consistently outperformed the rest of the world as well as our system of higher education--not our automobile business, not our aluminum business, and not our K-12 system. Even the Senate rarely raises above the level of the Baghdad Parliament when it comes to getting consensus on the war in Iraq. But the system of higher education, with all its sometimes stuffiness and its disagreeable political correctness, and even with the lengthy  vacations and even with more tenure than probably is deserved, as a whole, is by far the finest in the world; and more regulation, as a whole, will make it worse, not more excellent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one other provision I want to mention. I am glad the committee included this. It is a statement about the protection of free speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Willie Morris, who wrote the "North Toward Home" about his days in Mississippi and the University of Texas and New York, wrote an eloquent statement about how the American Association of University Presidents rose up about the political correctness at the time he was a student. That was in the 1950s--I guess early 1960s. At that time, the political correctness in part of Texas, or all of Texas, was segregationist, very conservative, and oppressive to those who had different points of view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the shoe is often on the other foot. Some deny that, but we know that is true. There are not many conservative speakers at college graduation ceremonies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope my friends in the university community will see in me someone who values higher education, who defends the importance of it in our society, who is working hard to keep our brainpower advantage in the world marketplace, who supports funding it generously, but who also believes that the greatest Achilles' heel of our system of higher education today is political correctness and a failure to take it seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colleges and universities are places where people ought to be allowed to say even outrageous things from the right and from the left. It is not a free and academic environment if you are only allowed to say outrageous things from the left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without belaboring that point, I conclude my remarks by expressing my appreciation once more to Senators Kennedy and Enzi. This is a first-rate bill. It will help students. It will help our country. It has a great many good ideas in it, and I hope there are others in this body and in the House of Representatives who will join me in recognizing that along with political correctness, the greatest threat to quality of higher education, in my view, is overregulation by the Federal  Government, and perhaps over time we can find some sensible ways to give it a little more freedom from this big stack of regulations that piled up over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remarks of Senator Alexander to Commission on the Future of Higher Education, Nashville, Tennessee</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for the time you are giving to this Commission's work, and thank you for inviting me to testify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've seen higher education from many sides, so I'm sometimes asked, "What's harder: being governor of a State, a member of a president's cabinet, or president of a university?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My answer is, "Obviously, you've never been president of a university, or you wouldn't ask such a question."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have six suggestions for recommendations you might make:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I hope you will urge the Administration that appointed you to make the National Academies' "Augustine Report" a focus of the President's State of the Union address in January and of his remaining three years in office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This 20-point, $10 billion a year report is the National Academies' answer to the following question that Senator Pete Domenici, Senator Jeff Bingaman and I posed to them in May: "What are the ten top actions, in priority order, that federal policy makers could take to enhance the science and technology enterprise so the United States can successfully compete, prosper and be secure in the global community of the 21st century?" The report was written by a distinguished panel of business, government  and university leaders headed by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As 2005 ends, we Americans--who constitute just five percent of the world's population--will once again produce nearly thirty percent of the world's wealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of this good fortune comes from the American advantage in brainpower: an educated workforce and our science and technology. More Americans go to college than in any other country. Our universities are the world's best, attracting more than 500,000 of the brightest foreign students. No country has national research laboratories to match ours. Americans have won the most Nobel Prizes in science, and have registered the most patents. We have invented the Internet, the automobile and the computer  chip, television and electricity. From such advances have come a steady flow of the world's best paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one scientist has said, we don't have science and technology because we're rich. We're rich because we have science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet I am worried that America may be losing its brainpower advantage. Most Americans who travel to China, India, Finland, Singapore and Ireland come home saying, "Watch out."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augustine panel found I am right to be worried:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, China trained 500,000 engineers, India 200,000, while the U.S. trained 70,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the cost of one chemist or engineer in the U.S., a company can hire five chemists in China or 11 engineers in India.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China is spending billions to recruit the best Chinese scientists from American universities to return home to build up Chinese universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also found signs that we are not keeping up:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. 12th graders performed below the international average of 21 leading countries on tests of general knowledge in math.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, only three American companies ranked among the top 10 recipients of new U.S. patents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of 120 new chemical plants being built around the world with price tags of $1 billion dollars or more, one is in the U.S. and 50 are in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the Augustine Report's 20 recommendations were:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recruit 10,000 new science and math teachers with 4-year scholarships and train 250,000 current teachers in summer institutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Triple the number of students who take Advanced Placement math and science exams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increase Federal funding for basic research in the physical sciences by 10 percent a year for 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Provide 30,000 scholarships and graduate fellowships for scientists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Give foreign students who earn a PhD in science, engineering and computing a "green card" so they can live and work here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Give American companies a bigger research and development tax credit so they will keep their good jobs here instead of moving them offshore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may wince at the $10 billion a year price tag. I believe that the cost is low. America's brainpower advantage has not come on the cheap. This year, one-third of State and local budgets go to fund education. Over 50 percent of American students have a Federal grant or loan to help pay for college. The Federal government spends nearly $30 billion per year this year on research at universities and another $34 billion to fund 36 national research laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this year, Congress has authorized $75 billion to fight the war in Iraq, $71 billion for hurricane recovery, $13 billion in increased Medicaid spending and $352 billion to finance the National debt. If we fail to invest the funds necessary to keep our brainpower advantage, we'll not have an economy capable of producing enough money to pay the bills for war, Social Security, hurricanes, Medicaid and debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from the war on terror, there is no greater challenge than maintaining our brainpower advantage so we can keep our good paying jobs. That is the surest way to keep America on top.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have attached an executive summary of the Augustine Report to my comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I suggest that you recommend that presidents of the United States appoint a lead adviser to coordinate all of the Federal government responsibilities for higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My greatest regret as U.S. Education Secretary was that I did not volunteer to be that lead person. Secretary Spellings, with the appointment of this commission, has assumed at least some of that responsibility. But the authority of the Secretary of Education over higher education is somewhat like the authority of the U.S. Senate majority leader or a university president:  overestimated. Almost every agency of the federal government has something to do with higher education, tens of billions of taxpayer dollars are invested every year and someone should be looking at all of this in a coordinated way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, I urge you to join me on the bandwagon for deregulation of higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The greatest threat to the quality of American higher education is not underfunding. It is overregulation. The key to the quality of our higher education system is that it is NOT a system. It is a marketplace of 6,000 autonomous institutions. Yet, thanks largely to the last two rounds of the Federal Higher Education Act, each one of our 6,000 higher education institutions that accepts students with Federal grants and loans must wade through over 7,000 regulations and notices. The president of  Stanford has said that seven cents of every tuition dollar is spent on compliance with governmental regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have attached to my testimony remarks I made to the U.S. Senate in June when I introduced the Higher Education Simplification and Deregulation Act of 2005, much of which was incorporated in the Higher Education Act reauthorization bill this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, I urge the Congress to overhaul the Medicaid program and free states from outdated federal court consent decrees so that states may properly fund colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have two charts before you that tell the story. Nationally, during the five year period from 2000 to 2004, State spending for Medicaid was up 36 percent, while State spending for higher education was up only 6.8 percent. As one result, tuition was up 38 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story in Tennessee was worse. Medicaid spending was up 71 percent, while higher education was up only 10.5 percent, and tuition was up 43 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, during this same four year period, Federal spending for higher education was up 71 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I left the governor's office in 1987, Tennessee was spending 51 cents of each State tax dollar on education and 16 cents on health care, mainly Medicaid. Today it is 40 cents on education and 26 cents on health care, mainly Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To give governors and legislatures the proper authority to allocate resources, Congress should give States more authority over Medicaid standards and more ability to terminate outdated Federal court consent decrees that remove decision-making authority from elected officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the two charts on spending trends, I have attached my remarks when Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas and I introduced the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, I hope you will put a spotlight on the greatest disappointment in higher education today: colleges of education. "At a time when America 's schools face a critical demand for effective principals and superintendents, the majority of programs that prepare school leaders range in quality from inadequate to poor." Those are not my words, but those of a new report by Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College, Columbia University. Or ask Richard Light, the Harvard professor, who is  working with university presidents trying to find and inspire a new generation of leaders for our colleges of education. Sometimes colleges of education are</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have attached an executive summary of Dr. Levine's report, "Educating School Leaders."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I hope you will put a spotlight on the greatest threat to broader public support and funding for higher education: the growing political one-sidedness which has infected most campuses, and an absence of true diversity of opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To describe this phenomenon, allow me to borrow some words from the past, which may sound familiar to your chairman, Charles Miller, who was once Chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas: "systematic, persistent and continuous attempts by a politically dominant group to impose its social and educational views on the university." This was what the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) called it in its censure of Texas Governor Pappy O'Daniel's Board of Regents  when the Board fired University of Texas President Homer Rainey in the 1940s. This is reported in Willie Morris' book, "North Toward Home." Then the AAUP was talking about one-sidedness imposed by the right, instead of by the left--but political one-sidedness is political one-sidedness, no matter from what direction it comes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is more to this charge of one-sidedness than the academic community would like to admit. How many conservative speakers are invited to deliver commencement addresses? How many colleges require courses  in U.S. history? How many even teach Western Civilization? How many bright, young faculty members are encouraged to earn dissertations in the failures of bilingual education or on the virtues of vouchers or charter schools?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not surprised that most faculties express liberal views, vote Democratic and that most faculty members resist authority. That is the nature of most university communities. But I am disappointed when true diversity of thought is discouraged in the name of a preferred brand of diversity. This one-sidedness is not good for students. It is not good for the pursuit of truth. And it undermines broad public support for higher education. The solution to this political rigidity lies not in Washington,  D.C., but in the hands of trustees, deans and faculty members themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas invited former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to join a small group of U.S. senators in the majority leader's office for a discussion. Dr. Cardoso was completing a residency at the Library of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"What memory of the United States will you take back to your country?" Senator Hutchison asked Dr. Cardoso.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The American university," he replied immediately. "The uniqueness, strength and autonomy of the American university. There is nothing like it in the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute Secretary Spellings and this Commission for undertaking to preserve and improve higher education, America's secret weapon for its future success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In coming to your conclusions, I hope that you will urge the President to adopt the Augustine Report and to designate a lead advisor for higher education, that you will jump on the bandwagon to deregulate higher education and preserve its autonomy, that you will urge Congress to overhaul Medicaid and Federal court consent decrees so States can properly fund higher education, and that you will urge trustees to revamp colleges of education and ensure a campus environment that honors true diversity  of opinion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I also rise in strong support of the higher education reauthorization bill before the Senate today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first thank my colleague, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, a true champion for education in our country. Senator Kennedy's vision for higher education will help make sure college is more accessible and affordable to all our young people regardless of their race, their class, or their income. It is because of the vision of Senator Kennedy, of Senator Pell before, and others that the doors to college have been opened to millions of Americans  who otherwise would not have had access to that American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Senator Enzi's leadership as well in bringing and moving this bill on the floor. I salute him for all of his work, both on the bill we had last week and now the bill we have today. It is a tremendous testament of what we can do when we join in a common cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone whose dreams of college could not have been realized without the power of the Pell grant and without other Federal aid, I am proud to be able to support legislation that will open the doors for the next generation of students in this country. Without the critical assistance I received, I would never have been able to be the first in my family to graduate from college, then later from law school, and I certainly wouldn't be speaking here on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us takes great steps toward improving and leveling the playing field for all students so that more students are able to access and afford a higher education. Today, all students do not have an equal chance to attend college. As an example, Latinos and African Americans are less likely to be able to afford college and, therefore, more likely to qualify for Federal financial aid. Latinos and African Americans are 40 to 60 percent less likely to earn a bachelor's degree in their  lifetime than other students. By also expanding Federal aid opportunities for minorities, the bill will help improve those numbers and close the gap in higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own story of growing up poor yet having the opportunity to fulfill my dream of attending college because of Federal aid is still true as a challenge for so many of our young people today, and it will continue to be for the young people of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The changes in this bill come at a critical time. It is projected that by the year 2015, 8 short years from now, college enrollment of African-American students will increase by 23 percent, and for Latinos that number will increase by a whopping 73 percent. Moreover, 75 percent of undergraduate students are nontraditional students, meaning they either are attending part time and working full time, non-high school graduates, or have dependents, among other characteristics. The student populations  of our Nation's colleges will increasingly reflect the changing landscape of our country. So this bill is going to help all of our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More and more of our students will not be the sons and daughters of previous college graduates. The student of tomorrow will be a mother who juggles a full-time job and attends community college part time at night so she can gain skills that will lead to a better job and provide her children economic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The student of tomorrow will be a naturalized U.S. citizen who, with the help of Federal aid, can fulfill his dream of becoming an engineer who can give back to this country by helping build new infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The student of tomorrow will be a foster child who is able to attend college with Federal aid and fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse so she can not only live a stable life but give back to a system that saved hers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The student of tomorrow will be a bright high school student who works part time through college and despite his family's low income can attend the college of his choice because of Pell and Perkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the students who will help define the students of our Nation--the first-generation students breaking through new barriers, the parents working to improve life for their children, the naturalized citizen building a better life in this country. They will each be charting their own path, able to realize their dreams because of the opportunity only a college education can provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How well educated they are will not just determine how successful they are in the workforce but how successful our Nation is in the global economy. As a nation, I am convinced that the single greatest asset we will have in this global economy is our collective intellect. To be a leader globally, we will have to be at the apex of the curve of intellect. That means the most highly educated generation this Nation has ever known. To get there, our education pipeline must be accessible and affordable  to a great cross-section of young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, rising costs, combined with far too stagnant growth in family income and declining Federal aid, have effectively priced out many students. Even with student loans and work study, today's students have thousands in unmet financial need they often cannot afford to pay. As a nation, we simply cannot afford to have our students priced out of a college education. Our Nation's future depends on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us will make key changes to help ensure the doors to college remain open to all, not just those who can afford it out of pocket. This bill realizes that improving access to college does not just mean increasing funding. Improving access to college means curbing rising tuition costs so that young people will be able to better afford a higher education. This bill will hold colleges accountable for rising tuition costs by making tuition data public and available so students  and their families can compare costs. By publicizing costs to prospective families, colleges will need to justify tuition increases that far exceed those of comparable institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving access to college means reforming the student loan system so students get loans that are fair, not loans that wash them away in debt. Outrageous loan debt is forcing borrowers to delay either buying a home in the future or taking the dream job of their choice after college simply because it will not pay enough. This bill reverses this troubling trend by not only expanding Federal aid but ensuring students are getting the best possible deal when they take out a loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving access to college also means starting at the first step--filling out the forms. As someone who had to fill out the FAFSA form by myself, it was pretty daunting. For any student facing this process on their own or for families with income, language, or other barriers, the financial aid process itself can be overwhelming. By reducing the FAFSA from 10 pages to 2  pages, we make it easier for students to accomplish the very first step necessary  to get financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By improving access to college, it also means helping students get on the right path early by strengthening and expanding programs such as GEAR UP and TRIO, by promoting quality teacher preparation programs, and helping high-needs public schools recruit and retain high-quality teachers. This bill takes low-income and first-generation students closer to their dreams of college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to expand access beyond the undergraduate realm. I am particularly pleased that this bill expands funding for minority-serving institutions and specifically supports the creation of graduate programs at Hispanic-serving institutions, a proposal I have supported for a long time. Latinos currently make up less than 6 percent of graduate students, and by expanding opportunities at Hispanic-serving institutions which enroll more than 50 percent of all Latino students in this country,  this expansion is an important step to ensuring the Nation's graduate and doctorate students reflect the diversity of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring our students are prepared to be the next generation of innovators, business owners, and leaders requires a serious commitment to making college affordable and accessible. This means making education work for all students. That is why we must take the steps to increase critical grant aid and strengthen key programs to help open the doors to college for all our young people. We must ensure our young people are getting the best possible deal when they apply to college and that every student  who is willing to work hard has the opportunity to graduate from college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that in this Nation in which this challenge for us globally is so significant, in which an engineer's report is created in India and transmitted back to the United States for a fraction of the cost, in which a radiologist's report is done in Pakistan and sent to your local hospital, read by your local doctor, if you have a problem with a credit card, as I recently did, you may end up in a call center in South Africa, in the pursuit of human capital for the creation of a product for  the delivery of a service; we are globally challenged. That is why this ability to have a generation that has the greatest educational achievement is so important to the Nation's competitive future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make sure that the opportunity I had as someone who had challenges is an opportunity that can be met by every student who is willing to work hard, has the ability, and gives something back to their country. This bill is going to make that happen. I think this bill takes us significantly in the right direction. I hope it will have incredibly robust support when its final passage comes up for a vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the reauthorization process continues, I want to highlight the importance of Hispanic serving institutions, and the role they play in educating our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hispanics should have equal opportunities to receive a first-class education, acquire the great jobs available in America, and pursue careers in any field they desire whether it's in medicine, law, business, education, or any other area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Census Bureau, Hispanics account for 1 out of every 2 people who are added to the Nation's population, and the U.S. Department of Labor estimates that 1 out of every 3 new entrants into the job market is Hispanic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The percentage of Hispanic students attending college has also increased significantly over the past few years. Because the pace of bachelor's degrees earned by Hispanics is accelerating rapidly, we must keep pace by increasing the capacity of our institutions of higher education to serve these students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Hispanic serving institutions are able to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HSIs continue to grow in stature and importance. They are home to more than half of all Hispanic college students, and are often the only viable opportunity for individuals of modest economic backgrounds to attend college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud HSIs for their vast contributions in providing quality educational opportunities to all Hispanic and non-Hispanic students who attend their institutions, and I remain committed to opening the doors of higher education to all Americans and keeping our country competitive in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been proud to serve as cochair of the HSI Coalition with my colleague Senator Bingaman of New Mexico. The success we have had over the past 11 years has us headed in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1995-2006, we have helped increase Federal funding for HSIs from $12 million to $95.8 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Third Higher Education Extension Act of 2006 removed two barriers harmful to Hispanics and HSIs. It eliminated the 2-year wait-out period between HSI grant funding cycles, as well as the requirement that 50 percent of the Hispanic student population must be low-income for the school to qualify for HSI eligibility. This allows HSIs to gain funding without costly gathering and reporting of individual Hispanic-student income documentation, which was often impossible for universities to obtain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the positive increases in college student matriculation, overall, too few Hispanic-Americans graduate from high school or college. If we fail to properly educate one-half of America's future workforce, there will be disastrous economic and social consequences for the entire nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we debate the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, I want to make sure that our federally-designated HSIs are not left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have ensured that the language of the Next Generation Hispanic Serving Institutions Act is included in the Higher Education Act. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation, which I introduced with Senator Bingaman on February 13, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides fellowships and support services for graduates, as well as facility and faculty improvements at HSIs. It provides new technology for distance education and collaborative arrangements with other institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the legislation increases the authorization of the current HSI program to $175 million and authorizes $125 million for the new HSIs graduate program for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to support these provisions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the higher education amendments before the Senate. This bill works toward one of the most important responsibilities elected representatives shoulder: opening the doors of educational opportunity for each American child and every American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Senate took a critical step toward making college more affordable by passing the Higher Education Access Act, legislation that increases Pell grants, caps student loan repayments, and provides loan forgiveness for those who enter and stick with careers in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we must actually control college costs if we hope to make permanent progress on college affordability. The legislation now before the Senate would not only allow the Secretary of Education to highlight those colleges and universities whose tuition increases are out of line with their peers, it would allow the Secretary to study what factors are driving soaring higher education costs in this country and identify what measures could be utilized to bring them under control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with this effort and the important measures passed last week, most students and their families in Maryland and around the Nation will still have to borrow money to make their college dream a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, that means completing lengthy and confusing Federal and school-based student aid applications. Once those applications are submitted, families must decipher various colleges' price estimates and various banks' descriptions of loan terms and conditions. Financial award letters often contain inconsistent definitions and formats to describe the cost of attendance, the financial aid offered, and the costs associated with various types of loans. Too many banks provide inadequate information  about their rates and terms. As a result, families are unable to shop around for the financial  aid package or best loan rates and are ill-prepared for post-graduation monthly payments. Jim Guest, president of the Consumers Union, has said that "[f]inancing a house or car can be confusing, but it's nothing compared with trying to pay for a college education."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of such confusion, many students and their families turn to financial aid officers to guide their choices. But throughout this year, thanks to the New York Attorney General and my distinguished colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we have learned that some financial aid officers, including, unfortunately, some from Maryland, were not giving families honest advice. Some financial aid offices were receiving expensive gifts, travel and other kickbacks  from lenders and in return recommended those lenders to students, even if the product was not in the students' best interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation takes critical steps to reform the entire student loan system so that students and their families will receive timely, accessible, and reliable information and can make wise college financing decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, the legislation would simplify the financial aid process for all students and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill reforms the Federal financial aid application. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, is currently 10 long pages full of complex questions. Its length and complexity create an unnecessary obstacle for low- and middle-income students seeking the aid they need to attend college. The higher education amendments simplify the FAFSA by creating a new two-page EZ-FAFSA for low-income students, and phasing out the current seven-page FAFSA for all applicants within 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the bill creates a pilot program that allows students to receive an aid determination or estimate in their junior year of high school. Rather than making complicated decisions in a frenzy of paper and options, the bill facilitates student planning, giving families time to investigate their financing options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This critical bill makes sure that those options are easier to understand. The bill requires the Secretary of Education work with colleges and universities to develop several model price calculators that would give students an institution's actual net price. With these bottom-line prices in hand--in clear and consistent terms--families will be better equipped to make the right college and financing choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plus, the bill requires lenders clearly disclose the terms of their loans and again asks the Secretary of Education to develop a consumer-friendly format so that families receive information in a consistent and accessible way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But critically important, the bill protects students by ensuring colleges recommend lenders based on students--not banks' or financial aid officers'--best interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires that colleges adopt and enforce a code of conduct that prohibits the college or any of its employees from accepting any significant gifts, trips, services, or other benefits from lenders, period. If a college chooses to select a "preferred lender," it must provide the Secretary of Education and the public a clear report explaining why the preferred products are in the best interest of students or their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions take critical steps towards cleaning up the student loan industry by removing the conflicts of interest that compromised the advice and integrity of too many financial aid offices and officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the student loans, the higher education amendments make more grant aid available to students in Maryland and around the nation. This bill expands eligibility criteria for Academic Competitiveness Grants, ACG, and National Science Mathematics Access to Retain</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Talent, SMART, grants; expands critical opportunities and services provided for low-income, first generation, and homeless college students under Federal TRIO Programs; increases grants to States to provide its young scientists and mathematicians with scholarships; and increases colleges' ability to reach out and prepare younger students for college through partnership programs. The bill makes it easier for colleges to use grant money to provide financial counseling and for students to engage  in public service opportunities as part of their work-study obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grant programs encourage colleges to build partnerships with the business community to address the Nation's workforce needs and to build programs that teach all students, and especially minority students, foreign languages and encourage them to enter international service fields. The bill creates a new grant program for predominantly Black institutions to enhance their capacity to service more low- and middle-income Black American students; and a new grant for colleges to develop and improve  their campus safety and emergency response systems in the wake of the terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do these changes mean for Maryland students? Well, instead of filling out a seven-page monstrosity, students will have access to a simpler two-page form, and eventually an on-line smart form that tailors later questions as a student answers earlier ones and may even be able to populate information from forms submitted to the IRS and other Government agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students will know their financial needs by their junior year of high school, enabling their family to examine straight-forward and honest documents outlining financing options. Families will be able to rely on financial aid officers for honest advice and will have greater access to financial aid counseling. Expanded grant eligibility requirements will give Maryland students increased access to grants and a better ability to pursue their dreams. St. John's students in Annapolis, for instance,  will now be able to apply for SMART grants whereas this unique institution's absence of formal majors was a barrier to student eligibility in the past. Students who choose to go to school year round will be eligible for a second Pell grant. The books and supplies allowance for Federal work-study students will go from $450 to $600.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most important, this bill takes steps toward addressing one of the most critical education problems we have in this country: a growing teacher shortage. As you know, Mr. President, teachers are our most valuable resource when it comes to educating our Nation's children. According to research, teacher quality is the schooling factor with the greatest effect on student achievement. Good teachers can make up to a full year's difference in learning growth for students and dwarf the impact  of any other educational investment, even smaller class sizes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But between the retirement of hundreds of thousands of baby boomers, efforts to reduce class sizes, and the No Child Left Behind law's raised standards for new teachers, school systems across the Nation can't find enough qualified recruits to fill their class rooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maryland is no different. In 2006, the Maryland Higher Education Commission found that the State "is not producing or attracting enough teachers to fulfill the staffing requirements of the State's school systems, especially in high need certification fields." High turnover only makes the problem worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is widely accepted that it takes 5 years to master the complex art of teaching. But one-third of new teachers leave the profession within 3 years, half within 5 years, and attrition is greater in schools in low-income, urban districts. Of the estimated 6 million people in the U.S. with teaching backgrounds or credentials, only 3 million are actually teaching. Not only does the turnover leave our classrooms without teachers, but recruiting and training new teachers costs the country $7 billion  a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because research shows even modest monetary incentives lower teacher attrition, especially in high-risk school districts, I introduced the Master Teacher Act of 2007 to reward "master teachers" with a 25-percent Federal tax exemption on their salary for 4 years if they agree to teach in a school that is not meeting No Child Left Behind's annual achievement goals. That legislation is now before the Senate Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more must be done to attract our best and brightest to teaching and then keep them there. Most professions, require new entrants go through extensive formal or informal apprenticeships before taking on the profession's full responsibilities. Not many graduate  law school and the next day walk into a courtroom and try a death penalty case or graduate medical school and immediately walk into an operating room to perform open-heart surgery. Those professions  require decades of training post-graduation. Teaching is an equally complex profession, melding academic theory and practice, and carries enormous responsibility for children's personal and our Nation's collective economic future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But too many teachers are thrown into a classroom with their own students, many with complex social, emotional, and learning needs, without sufficient training or support. And too many leave the profession feeling frustrated, defeated, and disheartened. Studies have shown a connection between support in the first year and teachers' moving between schools and leaving the profession. A helpful mentor, as reported by teachers, significantly reduces the chances of quitting in the first year. Common  planning time and collaboration with other teachers are strong predictors of teachers' decisions to stay in a school and the profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The higher education amendments will improve teacher quality, training, and retention by promoting high-quality and effective teacher preparation programs for new and prospective teachers, and help high-need schools by focusing on recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers in high-need schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill creates competitive grants for innovative teacher preparation programs that address the need for stronger teaching methods and better teacher support. The bill provides a competitive grant for college level preparation programs that include evidence-based teaching methods, mentoring programs for the teacher's first 2 years in service--called induction programs--and new accountability measures to allow programs to improve the training offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides grants to teaching residency programs, programs that provide participants a 1-year stipend to engage in a guided teaching apprenticeship with a master teacher that integrates theory and practice and includes master's degree coursework. These residency programs must place participants in high-needs schools and work with local school districts to develop an induction program to provide continued support to residents once the program ends. These programs must also contain  accountability measures methods that allow for program evaluation and improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my gratitude to Senators Kennedy and Enzi and the rest of my colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for all their hard work and leadership in bringing such a comprehensive and innovative bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I first ran for elected office in my home State of Maryland at the age of 22. I sought elected office because I believed that government can make a difference in people's lives. This bill, reauthorizing the Higher Education Act of 1965, does just that, and I am proud to offer my support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, due to the delay of my flight from Rhode Island, I was unavoidably absent for vote No. 273, the Brown amendment to create a new Federal Supplemental Loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had I been present, I would have supported the Brown amendment No. 2376. We know that more and more students are taking out private loans with high interest rates. Senator Brown's amendment seeks to provide an alternative for those students who have exhausted their grant and Stafford loan aid and continue to need assistance in meeting their college cost of attendance. I have heard concern that such a program could provide a disincentive to States to provide additional grant aid, but  I believe we must address the fact that too many moderate- and low-income students take out high interest private loans, which creates an unmanageable loan burden for these students and their families. The Brown amendment is an attempt to rectify this situation and although not perfect, it is worthy of inclusion in the committee's deliberation.</paragraph>
