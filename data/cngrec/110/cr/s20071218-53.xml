  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the retirement from the Senate of a person of great skill and accomplishment, Patricia Knight. She will be greatly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trish has devoted more than a quarter century of her life to public service, the last nine years as chief of staff to my good friend and colleague, Senator ORRIN HATCH. Her leadership on so many issues over that time has improved the lives of millions of Americans in so many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Trish has brought her skills and energy to bear on a range of important issues from energy policy to foreign policy and so much more. She served in the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration as a key adviser on health legislation. She has been an aide on the Appropriations Committee covering bills as vast as funding for the Commerce Department and our foreign aid programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In no area has her able hand been more evident than health care. Before her appointment as chief of staff, Trish served as chief health adviser to Senator Hatch. In that capacity, she was his lead staffer in the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program which today provides health coverage to more than 6 million poor children. She was a leader, too, in improving the work of the Food and Drug Administration in enhancing the safety and efficacy of prescription drugs and food.  The Public Health Service is a stronger agency because of Trish's able work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all, she has been a trusted adviser and friend to so many of us. It was always clear where Trish stood on a question, and she always had clear reasons for her views. Everyone who worked with her respected her for her wisdom, judgment and determination to succeed. Her subtle humor and great spirit got us through many very difficult negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trish, we love you and we will miss you and wish you well in the next adventure.</paragraph>
