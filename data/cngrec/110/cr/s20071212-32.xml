    <paragraph>Mr. President, Wyoming lost a beloved member of its agricultural community this weekend to a tragic accident. Olin Sims, a fourth generation rancher from McFadden, WY, and president of the National Association of Conservation Districts served his community with a great passion for conservation, agriculture, and family values. Olin provided this body with sound advice and testimony on a number of occasions regarding the natural resource needs of our Nation. Although his life ended  early, his contributions to our State and Nation will never end. The good he has done will benefit generations to come. He did what all of us should strive to do--leave this world a better place. Diana and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the family, friends, and colleagues of Olin Sims.</paragraph>
