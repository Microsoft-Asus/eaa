  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8145">S8145</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader and I are going to shortly have a conversation that will hopefully help us as a body to determine which direction we are going to go over the next few days. We have before us the Defense authorization bill; 30 hours postcloture is running now. We have our regular caucuses this afternoon, as we always do, and hopefully this afternoon we will start legislating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the statement I just completed, there will be a period of morning business, with Senators allowed to speak for 10 minutes each, with the Republicans controlling the first half and Democrats controlling the second half. Following that, we will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>, the Defense authorization bill. The Senate will recess, as I have indicated before, from 12:30 until 2:15 today to allow for the weekly caucus luncheons to occur.</paragraph>
