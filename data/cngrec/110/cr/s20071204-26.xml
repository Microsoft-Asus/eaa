  <narrative>NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (Senate - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14736">S14736</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the National Bible Association and the most influential force ever known to mankind, the Holy Bible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each day, about 168,000 Bibles are sold, given away, or otherwise distributed in the United States. November 18 through 25 was National Bible Week, which, along with the National Bible Association, I hope increased that exposure to help spread the Good News contained within its pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The timing of National Bible Week couldn't be more appropriate since it encompasses the Thanksgiving Holiday. As you know, Thanksgiving commemorates the story and the plight of the Pilgrims, who fled to the New World to escape religious persecution and joined with their new neighbors to give thanks for offering their friendly aid and for coming to their rescue in a dire time of need. Like the Pilgrims, the Bible recounts numerous cases of religious persecution of the children of Israel and the  extreme hardships suffered by many over thousands of years. But the Bible also gives us hope, and the comfort of knowing God will help us to persevere and endure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The theme of neighborly assistance and thanks, as well as the many other valuable and moral lessons or guidance for treating one's neighbor and fellow man, are imparted in the Bible and even served as a moral compass to our Founding Fathers. The Judeo-Christian Bible became the cornerstone of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we now find ourselves in the midst of the Christmas season, National Bible Week should serve as an important reminder to always turn to the Bible, recognize its wisdom and Divinely inspired words, and reflect on its meaning in our own lives, especially in how we interact with and treat our neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond serving as a personal moral compass on how to become a better person and neighbor, the Bible reassures us of God's infinite love for His creation. I encourage you to pick up and read the Bible and become awed by the history, lessons, and adventures found within its pages. As we celebrate National Bible Week, let us share the positive message of the Holy Bible with our families, friends, and neighbors.</paragraph>
