  <chair>The committee amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1790, the Non-Intercourse Act was enacted reserving the right to acquire land, or an interest in land, owned by an Indian tribe in the United States. It was intended to prevent third parties from taking advantage of Indians by prohibiting the lease, transfer, encumbrance or conveyance of lands from an Indian tribe without Federal approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague, Representative Peter DeFazio, introduced the pending measure to exempt the conveyance of non-trust lands made by a Tribe located in Oregon. In this particular case, the law is preventing this Tribe from fully engaging in non-gaming economic development on fee land because Federal approval is required for leases between the Tribe and third parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
