    <paragraph>Mr. President, honest and fair. Friendly and helpful. Considerate and caring. Courageous and strong. For 80 years, the Girl Scouts of Ouachita Council have worked to instill these values into the girls of central and southeast Arkansas. On April 14, 2007, they will gather together to celebrate this impressive anniversary, and I want to take this time to celebrate with them. Their tireless commitment to the young women of our State has helped bring out the best in the daughters  of Arkansas, and we owe them a great deal of thanks for this important work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the stated mission of building girls of courage, confidence and character, the Girl Scouts of America started as a group of just 18 in Savannah, GA, in 1915. And as the Scouts have grown up along with the country, their cause has lost none of its relevance or necessity. They have brought those simple, yet noble ideals to all parts of the Nation and now proudly claim a membership of more than 3.6 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the Girl Scouts, young women develop a sense of civic responsibility and self-esteem that helps them realize the critical role they have to play in their communities and their country. Similar ideals were taught to me at an early age by my family and have helped to motivate and inspire me throughout my career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years ago, my mother told me, "It's a fact, not a fault, that we haven't had more women in elected office. It's just the way history turned out. But it's our fault if we don't do something to change that and to bring more women into government and the future."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am proud to be one of 16 women serving in the Senate--the largest class of women Senators in American history. Across the country, we see women taking more active leadership roles not only politics, but business, education and science. We have built on the great foundation that was laid for us by generations past, and it is our responsibility to these courageous leaders to continue momentum forward. This is especially true in Arkansas as we carry on legacy of Hattie Caraway, the first  woman ever elected to the Senate and a trailblazer for women in politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is still much left to do, and the unyielding commitment of groups like the Girl Scouts will prepare the next wave of great American women to the benefit of their communities and country. Once again, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations and most sincere thanks to the Ouachita Council for 80 years of service to the girls of Arkansas.</paragraph>
