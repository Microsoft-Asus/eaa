    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that on July 15-17, 2007, more than 250 students from 33 countries will travel to Washington, DC, to participate in Empowering a New Generation for Democracy: The International Project Citizen Showcase. The showcase is the culmination of months of work by students to create public policy plans to solve problems in their local communities from around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Project Citizen, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education under the Education for Democracy Act, actively engages young people in the civic life of their communities. This interactive education program promotes engagement in government by challenging students to identify a public policy issue that is important to them, propose a solution, and create a political action plan for implementation of their solution. This year's projects addressed a wide range of issues from drug addiction  to neglected historical monuments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite my colleagues to observe these impressive portfolios on exhibit Tuesday, July 17, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Russell Caucus Room.</paragraph>
