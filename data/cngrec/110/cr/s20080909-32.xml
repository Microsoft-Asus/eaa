    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my friend Senator Dianne Feinstein and I ask our colleagues to join us today in honoring the memory of an extraordinary young man, Fairfield City councilmember Matt Garcia. Matt, a dedicated public servant, was shot in a senseless act of violence on the evening of Monday, September 1, 2008. Matt passed away on Friday, September 5, 2008. He was 22 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November 2007, Matt was elected to a 4-year term on the city council of Fairfield, CA. Just 21 years old when he was elected, Matt was the youngest councilman in Fairfield City history and one of the youngest elected officials in the State of California. With a deep sense of civic pride, Matt worked tirelessly to address Fairfield's crime rate and to develop effective gang prevention programs. In his short time on the council, Matt served with distinction and passion, earning the respect of  both his colleagues on the council and the youth of his beloved city.</paragraph>
