  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="Introducing S. 2741. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for disability savings accounts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2741">S. 2741</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Disability Savings Act of 2008. This important legislation is designed to help individuals with disabilities live full and productive lives for all their years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, disability is a part of human experience. The U.S. Census Bureau reports nearly 20 percent of Americans have some level of disability while 12.5 percent reported a severe disability. We should do what we can to make it possible for these Americans to live independently, exert control and choice over their lives, and fully participate in their communities. One of the key ways we can accomplish this goal is to help individuals with disabilities and their families save money for  disability related expenses, especially those expected over the course of full life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Congress has provided incentives to American families to save for various long term goals: college education, home ownership, and retirement. These incentives have given families the tools to help their children, well after they have left the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for families who have a child with a disability, particularly a cognitive disability, these goals may not match their needs. Many of these children will depend on Medicaid, Social Security Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income. They cannot risk losing these benefits. And they may never get to the point where they can consider college or home ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These individuals will frequently incur significant additional costs related to services and supports necessary to maintain health and independence. Parents also have to worry about what will happen to their children after they are gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Institute on Disability reports that over 1/3 of adults with disabilities live in households with income of $15,000 or less. According to the 2005 American Community Survey, median earnings for individuals with disabilities were a little more than half of the median income of those without disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is common for families to provide for individuals with significant disabilities who cannot support themselves. These families often do this at great cost to themselves both financially and emotionally. They do it out of love, and they do not ask to be relieved of their burdens. But they are hoping that we can provide the tools to help them ensure their loved ones can lead full lives for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am introducing the Disability Savings Act of 2008. This bill  will encourage individuals with disabilities and their families to save money for their unique disability-related needs in Disability Savings Accounts. These accounts will provide a tax-advantaged mechanism for individuals with disabilities to save money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interest on these accounts, with a balance of up to $250,000, will be tax free. Expenditures from the accounts for specific qualified services such as education, medical services, employment training and support, and transportation, will not be subject to income tax. The accounts will be easier to manage, and use than other existing savings mechanisms for individuals with disabilities. To be sure these accounts are available to low and moderate income earners, there will be a refundable matching  tax credit of up to $1000 for contributions. Account holders can even roll funds from college savings plans and special needs trusts for the same beneficiary into the Disability Savings Account without penalty. These accounts will supplement, not supplant, benefits provided by other, sources such as Medicaid, private insurance, and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, and the assets held within them will not be counted against eligibility for those programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to be eligible to have a Disability Savings Account, beneficiaries must be determined to be blind or disabled by the Social Security Administration or the Disability Determination Service of a state, and be under the age of 65. The accounts can be held and managed through a financial institution by the beneficiary, their spouse or family member, or a legal guardian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my colleagues will see the benefit of this approach and join me in this effort. I urge them to cosponsor this legislation and work with me to give individuals with disabilities and their families the tools they need to live healthy independent lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Disability Savings Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience. Individuals with disabilities have the right to live independently, to exert control and choice over their own lives, and to fully participate in and contribute to their communities through full integration and inclusion in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Americans with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty than those without disabilities. According to the World Institute on Disability, over one-third of adults with disabilities live in households with income of $15,000 or less compared to only 12 percent of those without disabilities. According to the 2005 American Community Survey, median annual earnings for individuals without a disability were $25,000 compared with $12,800 for those with a severe disability.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Families often provide the primary financial assistance necessary for individuals with significant disabilities who cannot support themselves. Families supporting members with disabilities often experience substantial negative effects on the vocational and economic health of the family.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Individuals with disabilities often incur significant additional costs related to services and supports necessary to maintain the health and independence needed to fully participate in society.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Throughout the years policymakers have provided incentives to Americans to save money for purposes such as home ownership, education and retirement. Many of these benefits do not meet the savings needs of individuals with disabilities and their families.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Encouraging individuals with disabilities and their families to save funds will allow them to achieve greater control, choice, participation in community, security, and independence in their lives.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The purposes of this Act are as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) To encourage and assist individuals and families in saving private funds for the purpose of supporting individuals with disabilities to maintain health, independence, and quality of life.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) To provide secure funding for disability-related expenses on behalf of designated beneficiaries with disabilities that will supplement, but not supplant, benefits provided through private insurance, the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act, the supplemental security income program under title XVI of such Act, the beneficiary's employment, and other sources.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4. DISABILITY SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Subchapter F of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exempt organizations) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;"PART IX--DISABILITY SAVINGS ENTITIES&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Sec..530A..Disability savings accounts.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"SEC. 530A.

  <narrative>EASTER SEALS,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, March 10, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR DODD: Easter Seals has long been concerned that individuals with disabilities and their families have too few options to save for the future. Currently, individuals must have exceptionally low incomes in order to access essential public services and supports. In those situations in which an individual's family wants to save for the future, a complicated web of state rules that guide special needs trust must be followed, and in nearly every circumstance, families cannot navigate  the system without the assistance of an attorney.</narrative>
  <narrative>For these reasons, Easter Seals is pleased to support the Disability Savings Act of 2008. This legislation clearly identifies the essential need to establish new protocols that enable families with limited incomes to effectively save financial resources to meet the future needs of their family member with a disability. Such protocols must be easy for a family to navigate without a lawyer and must not impose barriers to future benefits such as those available through the Medicaid program. Easter  Seals looks forward to working with you to see that legislation that can help these families is enacted in 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>As the leading non-profit provider of services for individuals with autism, developmental disabilities, physical and mental disabilities, and other special needs, Easter Seals works to ensure that individuals with disabilities can live, learn, work and play in their communities. Thank you for considering our views.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Katherine Beh Neas,</narrative>
