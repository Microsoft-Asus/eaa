    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, does it not seem ironic that the week in which we are scheduled to vote on a lobbying and ethics reform bill, that I might add is largely a carbon copy of a Republican bill from last year, we are faced with the behavior of a high-ranking Member of the Democrat leadership who made a threatening comment to another Member?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are the American people supposed to make of the failure of the majority to keep their promises? Instead of delivering real reform, the Democrats march in lockstep behind one of their own, despite this clear violation of House ethics rules. Not only has the majority failed to deliver on their agenda, they have shown they will tolerate behavior in their ranks which is antithetical to their so-called reform efforts. In so doing, they have forfeited their credibility.</paragraph>
