    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a message from the House with respect to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>, the Department of Defense authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (<bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>) entitled "An Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2009 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes", do pass with an amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the House amendment to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. This bill was voted out of the Senate Armed Services Committee by a unanimous vote back in April. Last week, the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 88-8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last week, we have worked around the clock to reconcile the Senate and House versions of the Defense authorization bill. The compromise version of the bill--the House amendment to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>--has now been approved by the House by on overwhelming bipartisan vote of 392-39.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we bring before the Senate today contains many provisions that will improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform, give them the tools that they need to defend our nation, and provide critical reforms to improve the operations of the Pentagon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, the bill would provide critical support to our men and women in uniform. For example, it would increase military pay by 3.9 percent--a half a percent more than the President requested; provide continued authority for the payment of enlistment and reenlistment bonuses, accession and retention bonuses for service members with critical skills or assigned to high-priority units, and other special bonuses and incentives needed to reward our troops and ensure that we can recruit  and retain the people that we need in our military; authorize funds for military family housing and military construction projects needed to ensure that our troops have the housing that they deserve and our military has the facilities it needs for the national defense; and protect members of the military, family members and retirees from any increase in TRICARE fees, premiums, deductibles and copays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would increase the end strength of the Army, the Marine Corps, and the Army National Guard, to help reduce the incredible stress on our troops. It would also establish and extend critical authorities needed by the Department of Defense in our current operations. For example, the bill would provide DOD the authority to use funds for quick-turnaround construction projects needed to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; extend DOD's authority to provide "train and equip" funds and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when thousands of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are deployed around the world and our all-volunteer military is straining to meet the requirements of two ongoing conflicts while remaining prepared for other contingencies, these are steps that we simply must take. When our men and women in uniform are in harm's way, there is nothing more important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes a number of measures to ensure the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would also ensure that the Iraqis use their own oil revenues rather than U.S. tax dollars to pay for large infrastructure projects and for the training and equipping of the Iraqi military. At the beginning of the Iraq war, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz testified that Iraq would be able  to "finance its own reconstruction" through oil revenues. That has not proven to be true. To date, the U.S. taxpayers have paid approximately $48 billion for stabilization and reconstruction activities in Iraq. While the Iraqi government has generated more than $100 billion in oil revenues since the war began, it has spent only a small fraction of that amount on its own reconstruction. The Iraqi government now has $80 billion at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects. Under  these circumstances, it is inexcusable for U.S. taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects that Iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other provisions of the bill would help improve the management of the Department of Defense and protect taxpayer dollars. For example, the bill would institute improved cost controls for the acquisition of major weapon systems; require program managers to incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the performance parameters for such systems; establish new ethics standards to prevent personal conflicts of interest by contractor employees who perform acquisition functions on behalf of the  Department of Defense; and establish a new database of information regarding contractor integrity, ensuring that this information  is available to acquisition officials making key contracting decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that procedural obstacles in the Senate precluded us from considering a package of more than a hundred amendments, which would have taken further steps to support our troops and improve the management of the Department of Defense. Where it was possible within the scope of the House and Senate bills, we tried to include eleme nts of these amendments. Unfortunately, many of these important amendments were beyond the scope of the two bills and will have to be deferred until next  year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also disappointed that we were unable to adopt provisions addressing the administration's excessive reliance on contractors to perform functions that should be performed by the uniformed military or by civilian federal employees. For example, both the Senate bill and the House bill included provisions that would have precluded the use of contractor employees to perform inherently governmental functions in an area of combat operations, or to conduct interrogations of detainees. Unfortunately,  these provisions drew a veto threat, so we had to limit ourselves to a Sense of Congress expressing our views on the issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this bill was under consideration in the Senate, we spent a great deal of time and effort discussing how best to provide public visibility for our funding decisions, including earmarks of funds authorized in the bill. Historically, our funding tables have been included in report language, rather than in bill language. In Executive Order 13457, the President stated his view that such funding decisions should be "included in the text of the bills voted upon by the Congress and presented to  the President."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Government Printing Office informed us that incorporating our funding tables into bill language would have added three full days to the time required to prepare a bill for floor consideration in the Senate and the House--even if GPO did not have other high priority work to accomplish at the same time. This delay would have been in addition to the day and a half it would have required for the committee staff to prepare the funding tables in a form that could be processed by  GPO, and to ensure the accuracy of GPO's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With only a few days left for the House and the Senate to consider the bill before the end of this year's session of Congress, we determined that placing the funding tables into bill language was not an option that was available to us. Instead, we have incorporated the tables into the bill by reference--an action that has the same legal effect. To ensure public visibility of all of the funding decisions in the tables, the tables have been posted on the websites of both the Senate Armed Services  Committee and the House Armed Services Committee. This is in addition to the posting on these websites of separate transparency tables which--as required by the Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives--provide information about each funding item requested by a Senator or a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of today, almost 200,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are deployed far from home, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait and other theaters of operations around the world. After more than 6 years of war, our military, particularly our ground forces, are severely stressed. Too many of our troops are worn out, their families are tired of repeated deployments, and our equipment is being used up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to enact this bill to improve the quality of life of our men and women in uniform. We need to enact this bill to give them the tools that they need to remain the most effective fighting force in the world. Most important of all, we need to enact this bill to send an important message that we, as a nation, stand behind them and appreciate their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when our men and women in uniform are sacrificing so much for our country every day, it is surely not asking too much for our colleagues to agree to enact this bill so we can provide our troops the support that they need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to support the House amendment to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>--the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to offer my sincere congratulations to Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, the members of our committee, and our House colleagues for their work on the fiscal year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. With provisions that authorize a considerable pay raise for all military personnel, increase Army and Marine end-strength, improve the system that serves wounded veterans, and help prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in defense contracting  and procurement, this bill contains many important provisions that will help support our national defense and, in particular, our servicemen and women. However, this bill also contains other provisions that are very problematic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before explaining my concerns with this bill, let me take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to Senator Warner for his many years of service to this Nation, not the least of which are 30 well-spent years in the Senate where he has been a consistent and steadfast champion of our men and women in uniform. Senator Warner has been instrumental in providing needed oversight of the Department of Defense, and in ensuring that our soldiers are well trained, well equipped, and  that they and their families are well provided for. I am particularly grateful for his contributions during this Congress when he so frequently stepped in on my behalf. Let me be clear that my concerns with this year's bill reflect in no way on Senator Warner outstanding efforts: He deserves much credit for the many exemplary provisions contained in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, in this year's bill, and the accompanying report, there are $5 billion in earmarks. Of that total amount, $2.1 billion arises from a single provision that authorizes the procurement of six C-17 Globemaster aircraft that the Defense Department states we neither need nor can afford. In my view, the massive pork spending in this bill renders it a frontal assault on this body's purported commitment to ethics and earmark reform and, in my view, results in a failure in our obligation to  the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the most egregious items in this bill are:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill provides more than $2.1 billion for 6 C-17 cargo aircraft. The Secretary of Defense wants to end production of C-17 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. These aircraft are neither requested nor required by the Department of Defense. In the fiscal year 2008 Defense supplemental appropriations, the Congress added another 15 C-17 aircraft that also were not requested nor required by DOD. Congress has earmarked 31 C-17s above the mount that is necessary in various Pentagon requirements  studies over the last 2 years. C-17 aircraft cost more than $300 million per plane. With this bill, the total number of C-17s procured will rise to 211 total aircraft. This is a thinly veiled effort to keep the C-17 production line open using taxpayer's dollars to fund what is essentially a more than $2.1 billion corporate earmark for the Boeing Corporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill provides $140 million in advance procurement for additional F-22s. The Air Force and contractors say that prohibiting spending in this bill would cause second tier suppliers to shut down and make it more expensive to restart the line if the next administration wants to continue production, even though the Secretary of Defense's position is that 183 F-22s is the full military requirement. Advanced procurement funding for additional F-22 aircraft is neither requested nor required.  This earmark is being pursued by Lockheed Martin and its supporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill includes funding of $88 million for a VIP aircraft to fly Air Force general officers. Scott AFB has served as headquarters for numerous Air Force commands. Today, two 4-star Air Force generals from the Air Mobility Command and the U.S. Transportation Command call Scott AFB, home. Just as senior leadership in-transit comfort capsules, SLICCs, created a stir several months ago when it was learned from Air Force documents that Air Force Generals were trying to use GWOT money to  purchase "first class" seats and beds in "flying pods" so that generals could travel in luxury when they fly overseas, it is egregious to think that while the military--mostly privates, sergeants, and petty officers--is engaged in the global war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, we would be spending scarce defense dollars on VIP aircraft for generals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill continues to fund the Presidential helicopter program for  next year at $1.1 billion. The VH-71A program is intended to provide the replacement helicopter for the transportation of the President and Vice President. The current program which would build 23 aircraft has had excessive delays and cost overruns of more than 70 percent. This level is well in excess of the percentages--in fact five times as much--that would trigger a breach  of the Nunn-McCurdy limits for major acquisition programs. Several program managers have been dismissed or reassigned in an effort to restructure this ailing program. This program should be cancelled. In the meantime the $1.1 billion to continue next year's development of the Presidential helicopter should be halted and the money withheld until the Navy and the contractor demonstrate more transparency and accountability on this failing program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill includes a provision directing the Secretary of the Navy to sell the "yard floating drydock", AFDL-23, to Gulf Copper Ship Repair in Aransas Pass, TX. This provision would authorize the Secretary of the Navy to sell the drydock; however, the provision restricts the Secretary from recouping the full costs, approximately $120-$190 million, because the Secretary is directed to consider the amounts paid by, or due and owing from, the lessee--Gulf Copper Ship Repair. This would  essentially allow the rent paid by Gulf Copper Ship Repair to be deducted from the total price of the drydock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Navy does not support this provision. The Navy is in the process of determining whether the dock is excess to future Navy needs and, if so, whether it would be required by other U.S. Government agencies or activities when the current lease to Gulf Copper expires. Subsequent to a determination that there are no additional U.S. Government needs, the vessel would be struck from the Naval Vessel Register and designated for disposal. This provision is an end-run of the normal process for disposal  or sale of government equipment and is not in the best interest of the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill includes a provision which is highly objectionable and is strongly opposed by the administration which purports to incorporate by reference into the bill most of the earmarks included in the accompanying report--totaling more than $5 billion. The provision is meant to thwart President Bush's Executive Order 13457 "Protecting American Taxpayers from Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had advocated a better approach of putting all the spending tables into the actual bill language. By hiding/shielding the tables in the report, the taxpayer does not have full transparency of Congress' actions in adding corporate and Member earmarks which are not requested or needed by the military services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, while there is much in this year's Defense authorization bill that is very worthwhile and helpful to providing for the national defense, the provisions contained within it that move in the wrong direction are too numerous, too large, and too costly for this Member to ignore.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was pleased the Senate passed the House Amendment to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, today by unanimous consent. This bill follows through on the commitment that this Congress has made to our troops and their families to provide them with the support that they need and deserve. This includes a 3.9-percent across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed personnel--a half a  percent more than the President's request--and a prohibition on increasing TRICARE beneficiary cost shares and pharmacy copays. It also includes a number of provisions designed to improve the readiness of our troops. For example, the bill fully funds Army and Marine Corps readiness and depot maintenance programs which will help ensure that the men and women in our armed services have</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, I was pleased to work toward the inclusion of a number of critically important management and acquisition policy provisions which were included in this bill. These include a provision to establish steering boards to review new requirements that could increase the costs of major weapons systems, language requiring business transformation offices for each military department and a provision requiring  the DOD to establish ethics standards to prevent personal conflicts of interest by contractor employees who perform acquisition functions on behalf of the DOD. I applaud the inclusion of language that expresses the view of Congress that private security contractors should not perform inherently governmental functions in an area of combat operations and that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, I was very pleased to have worked toward the inclusion of a number of provisions related to the treatment of wounded warriors. This includes a clarification of the requirement that DOD utilize the VA criteria in establishing eligibility of retirement and disability. It also requires the Secretaries of Defense and the VA to jointly establish a center of excellence in the mitigation, treatment and rehabilitation of traumatic extremity injuries and  amputations as well as a center of excellence in the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of hearing loss. In addition, this bill includes a provision derived from legislation that I introduced to extend senior-level oversight of cooperative efforts between the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. The Senior Oversight Committee, SOC, was formed in the wake of last year's Walter</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I would like to thank Chairman Levin for his strong leadership and dedication to ensuring that this bill was passed. I also want to take this last opportunity to extend my warmest aloha to my friend and colleague Senator Warner who managed this bill on the minority side. In my many years of serving with Senator Warner on the Armed Services Committee, I have never failed to be impressed by his character, graciousness, and collegiality. Mahalo Nui Loa for  your friendship and for all that you have done for our nation and the members of our armed services in particular.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am overjoyed this has been done.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have said on many occasions--and I say it again--this bill is a great piece of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has the bill passed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The request was agreed to. The bill has passed.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OK, REID." of="">
    <paragraph>Now, I said it before, and I will say it again: I so admire and respect the two managers of this bill who have worked together on this bill for 30 years. There was a time this year when we thought this would be the first year in those 30 years that my friends have worked on this bill that it would not pass. And it did. It is done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great day for America. It is a great day for our troops. As I have said to my two friends, I appreciate so much being able to work with you. It is a great honor for me that the two distinguished senior Senators, whom I have so much respect and admiration for, would allow me to, being a part of the Senate, come and offer this consent agreement. I am going to talk on Monday about my friend from Virginia who is leaving. So I will save those words for him. He already knows the knowledge I  have of our friendship.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. I say to him, as you referred to: Two Senators who worked on this, coincidentally, it is the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, who is in the chair to whom you were referring. We both thank you, and we thank Senator McConnell and all Members of the Senate for their support in passing this key piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes people are concerned that this institution does not quite work in a manner in which is easily comprehensible. But this is an effort that has been one that you and I and all the members of our committee and the distinguished staff whom we have on the committee have worked on throughout this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the Presiding Officer, you are the chairman. I am now the senior serving Republican on it, the former chairman, having served with you. Senator McCain is the ranking member. By reason of necessity, he is absent; otherwise, he would be standing here today in terms of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not about us, though. It is about the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families and their loved ones and their friends. The Constitution provides very explicitly that the President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. To the legislative branch--the Congress of the United States--is entrusted the care and welfare and safety and, indeed, protection of the men and women of the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I commend the distinguished Presiding Officer, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator CARL LEVIN of Michigan, with whom I have worked these 30 years, side by side, on this committee. This is a good bill. There were times when I think we could have made it stronger. But given the rules of the Senate, which I respect, as does the Presiding Officer, and all other Senators, we were not able to quite achieve those goals. But that is the nature of the Senate. The minority  has a very respected and powerful voice in this Senate, and it is right and just that it be heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So despite the fact this bill may not have all the features and important provisions I and the Senator from Michigan and other members of our committee and other Senators might have had incorporated in this bill, it is still a very fine bill. It adequately--most adequately--cares for the men and women of the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I commend the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Michigan, my friend of these 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu. The Senator from Michigan.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, first, let me thank the Presiding Officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bittersweet moment for me. This will be the last time the Senator from Virginia and I will be standing here and celebrating the passage of a Defense authorization bill. We stood together in support of these bills and the men and women of our Armed Forces for 30 years. In this particular case--there have been previous examples of this, but this is perhaps the most dramatic one--we would not be standing here with a bill in hand now going to the White House but for the courage of the Senator  from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not go into all the details as to how that came about, but it is because of his commitment to the men and women in uniform that we have a bill. We would not have a bill this year except that he took the steps which he was determined to take as a Senator of this Nation--not just of Virginia--to support the men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on behalf of 25 committee members, 45 committee staff members, 2.3 million Active Duty and Reserve members of the military and their families, I offer a heartfelt thanks for them for a job always well done by the Senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will have more to say about the Senator from Virginia also next week. But for the time being, let me say this: In the future, when we cannot seem to find our way out of the difficult situations that a bill of this magnitude and complexity get us into, people will say: Well, what would JOHN WARNER have done? That will be the question we will ask. When we ask that question, the right answers will follow. I thank my dear friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my dear friend. If I could take a moment. I wish to join the Senator in thanking our respective leaders, Senator Reid, Senator McConnell and the members of the committee and the staff, once again, and indeed the members of the leadership staff and the floor staff who made possible this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I wish to tell a short personal story since this is my last bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just walked through Senator Reid's office. He asked me to come in and visit with him privately a minute. As I passed by, I looked up on the wall, and there was a portrait of Harry Truman. I had the privilege of serving in the Navy in World War II--the closing year of World War II--as a young 17-year-old, 18-year-old sailor, and never dreaming I would ever be a Senator--that was the furthest thing from my mind--a 17-year-old, 18-year-old sailor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was one of the darkest hours of the United States. Roosevelt was then President. Truman was Vice President. It was the winter of 1945. I, similar to so many young men at that time--and those women who joined the military also--signed up and volunteered. We wanted to be a part of this. The war had gone unexpectedly the wrong way in Europe for a while when Hitler trapped our divisions and Allied divisions in the Battle of the Bulge. Iwo Jima was underway. Okinawa, a terrific battle, was on the  horizon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America was all together, and we were determined to establish our freedom in the world. But I remember my first night--I had been on a steam train for about 2 days, working its way up to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. It would stop at the station, and 17-, 18-year-old guys would get on the train, and they would be in those old cars, cold, shivering, with no food that I can remember to speak of. We arrived at the Great Lakes at about 4 o'clock  in the morning. We all were herded off the train into a great big gymnasium. A fellow, a chief petty officer--he was as big around as he was tall; I remember a very big fellow--got up, and he had a bullhorn, and shouted at us. I remember the words--here it was 65 years ago, 66 years ago--as if it were this minute. He said: All you guys who can't read and write, raise your hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I had been in a wonderful home. My father provided well as a medical doctor, with the best of schools, even though I left school to join the Navy. I did not know people who did not know how to read and write. Some of the other guys' hands were raised, and the fellow said, through the bullhorn: All right, you smart guys, fill out the forms for the others. So I and others went over to help those people fill out their forms--put their X on it. The next day, we were in the training camps side  by side, all training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those men went on to different tasks in the military but important tasks. There were many jobs in our military that did not require an education, but they were as important a part of the force as those of us, I guess, who felt we were a little smarter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But why do I tell that story? I later served in the Marines. So I look back over these 60 years. I have spent a great deal of my life associated with the men and women of the Armed Forces. My Active service is of no great consequence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the thing I have always remembered is that you and I, as a team, I say to the Senator--all these years we have been working here, we have been working to improve and make possible that the current generation of young men going into the uniform, and women, have the same advantages my generation had: The GI bill--working with Senator Webb recently to get that through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always feel I am a Senator today because of all the military men and women whom I have served with, who  have trained me, who have disciplined me, who have inspired me. They performed the same duty I did that cold night in 1945. They have helped me fill out the forms. I have learned from them, have had the wisdom to work with you and others to put together these legislative measures for their benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I close my last words thanking all those in uniform who have so generously given to me their wisdom, their friendship, their inspiration, and their courage to do what little I have been able to do as a Senator to help me fill out the forms and put my X on this my last bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Madam President, the men and women of this Nation would be grateful to John Warner if they knew him, had that honor of knowing him. They have been benefited by him even though they will never know him. Maybe as a 17-year-old sailor back in 1945, the last thing in his mind was that he would ever be a Senator. There is something about this Nation that makes it possible for men and women--in this case a man such as John Warner--to rise to the very top of the respect  of his country men and women. It has been a true pleasure and honor to serve with him.</paragraph>
