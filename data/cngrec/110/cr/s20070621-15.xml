  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="STAFF SERGEANT MICHAEL A. BECHERT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of the brave staff sergeant from Indiana. Michael Bechert, 24 years old, died on June 14 from injuries sustained on May 30, 2007, in Baghdad, Iraq, when his vehicle encountered an improvised explosive device. With his whole life before him, Michael risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An Indiana native, Michael last resided in Germany where he met his wife Daniela. In addition to his military service, Michael was a devoted husband and the father of their 20-month-old boy, Branden. "He was a great father, husband. A young, fresh young man. He fought for his country and died for it," said Daniela. Along with his wife and son, he leaves behind his father Michael L. Bechert and his grandparents George and Doris Bechert who raised him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division in Schweinfurt, Germany. He was killed during his second deployment in Iraq, while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During his first tour of duty he was injured and deservingly awarded the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Michael's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Michael, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. Today and always, Michael will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Michael's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Michael's actions will live on far longer that any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of Michael A. Bechert in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Michael's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears  from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Michael.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of the brave private first class from Indiana. David Wilkey, 22 years old, died on June 18th, 2007, from injuries sustained on June 17th, in Baghdad, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol. With an optimistic future before him, David risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although David was extremely proud of his military service, he prided himself most on his family. He was a devoted husband to Melinda and loving father of 4-year-old stepson Christian Clark and 1-year-old son Blayke. They also have another child due in October. David's love for his family drove him to enlist, in order to continue his support of them. David is also survived by his mother Cindy, his father David Sr., stepmother Margaret, as well as two sisters and a brother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David was on his first deployment in Iraq and had been there since February 2007. Assigned to D Company, 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, Fort Riley, Kansas, he was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. "He had a big heart, and he's a son that any father could be proud of," David Sr. said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join David's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of David, a memory that will burn  brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. Today and always, David will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of David A Wilkey, Jr. in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.
