  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 47, which I introduced to recognize the extraordinary heroism and sacrifice of the Nation's  Medal of Honor recipients and to increase America's awareness of the significance and meaning of the Medal of Honor among our American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) for being here in support of this issue this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Medal of Honor is our Nation's highest military award for valor in action against an enemy that can be bestowed on any member of the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the medal was created in 1861, more than 3,400 individuals who have served our Nation in uniform have been awarded the Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first medal was established by the United States Navy to recognize sailors and marines who distinguish themselves in war. President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law, and thus the first medal of valor was created. The Army shortly followed in 1862 by establishing a Medal of Honor to recognize commissioned officers and privates who distinguished themselves by their gallantry in action. The Medal of Honor became a permanent decoration in 1863. The first award was given to  Army Assistant Surgeon Bernard J.D. Irwin for his bravery in rescuing 60 soldiers at Apache Pass, Arizona, in 1861.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very interesting, Mr. Speaker, that a Medal of Honor was awarded a Union soldier years after the 1861 Battle of Lexington, Missouri, my hometown, for his gallantry in helping to retake the Anderson House, which was the hospital at the time of that battle, September 18, 19 and 20, 1861. His name was Palmer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current conflict in Iraq sadly has posthumously added two heroic and courageous individuals to the rolls, Sergeant First Class Paul Smith of the United States Army, and Corporal Jason Dunham of the United States Marines. These two individuals continue to epitomize the recipients of the Medal of Honor, whose uncommon valor and extraordinary bravery are standard characteristics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It is interesting to note also, Mr. Speaker, that in the history of the medal, 19 men received a second award. 14 of them received two separate medals for separate actions, and one was awarded to a woman. Of the more than 3,400 medals awarded, 266 of those were awarded for action during World War II, and 154 were awarded for action during the Vietnam conflict. Today there are only 111 living recipients of the Medal of Honor. America is rapidly losing its greatest and true heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that when Missouri's President, Harry Truman, awarded the Medal of Honor to a soldier at the end of the Second World War, he said he would rather have this medal than being president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution before the House seeks to recognize the heroism and sacrifice of the Nation's Medal of Honor recipients, and to urge the establishment of a National Medal of Honor Day to ensure that all Americans continue to celebrate and to honor the contributions and ideals that the Medal of Honor recipients exemplify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Skelton for giving me this great privilege of honoring these fine Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we join together in support of <bill type="hc" number="47">H. Con. Res. 47</bill>, as the United States House of Representatives, to honor what is arguably the most select group of Americans to ever wear the uniform of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medal of Honor is this Nation's highest award bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Services who distinguishes himself or herself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medal of Honor confers special privileges on its recipients, both by tradition and by law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By tradition, all other soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen, even higher ranking officers up to the President of the United States, initiate the salute of the Medal of Honor and its recipient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss briefly the history of the Medal of Honor. The first award of the Medal of Honor was made March 25 of 1863 to Private Jacob Parrott and five others. Since then, there have been 3,463 Medals of Honor awarded for 3,456 separate acts of heroism performed by 3,443 individuals, including nine unknowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today there are 112 living recipients of the Medal of Honor, out of a population of more than 301 million Americans. Forty-six percent of the living earned their medals more than 50 years ago while serving in World War II, 36, or Korea, 15. There are 61 living who performed actions in Vietnam. The youngest recipient is Gordon R. Roberts, age 56. He was born June 14, 1950. He was 19 years old when he earned this high honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield to Dr. Burgess, the gentleman from Texas, for 4 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairman, the gentleman from Missouri, for bringing this concurrent resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a resolution that honors the bravest of the brave, the men and women who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, who have risked their lives in fighting for our Nation, indeed, fighting for our basic freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's resolution pays homage to the basic principles of our military, duty, honor, country. The Medal of Honor recognizes and is emblematic of great courage, selflessness and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that I stand here on the floor of Congress today, as Congress is recognizing these extraordinary members of our Armed Services by establishing March 25 as the National Medal of Honor Day. This national day of observance and remembrance is long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution, to vote in favor of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While a National Medal of Honor Day is a wonderful way to honor these great citizens, I would be remiss if I did not also mention another great endeavor that seeks to honor Medal of Honor recipients. The city of Gainesville, Texas established the Medal of Honor Host City Program in 2001 with this simple mission statement: It shall be the privilege and the responsibility of the city of Gainesville, Texas, to welcome our Nation's Medal of Honor recipients at every available opportunity. The Local  Veterans of Foreign Wars, post number 1922, along with the community volunteers and community members, welcome all Medal of Honor recipients with open arms and provides a stipend to cover lodging, food and fuel expenses during their visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recipients are invited to attend schools, clubs and local organizations, thereby imparting their own views of patriotism and duty throughout the community. It is truly a remarkable program, and the true beauty of it is that other cities can establish their own Medal of Honor Host City program to further honor and recognize those heroic recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to take a line from the Gainesville, Texas mission statement, I feel that it is Congress's privilege and Congress's responsibility to honor the Medal of Honor recipients at every opportunity. With this resolution, and with programs like the Medal of Honor Host City Program, we take a step in fulfilling that most noble and honorable of all missions.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since I have been in Congress, America has presented this award on behalf of an extremely grateful Nation a total of 22 times, 13 of which were presented posthumously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some recent heroes include Tibor "Ted" Rubin for actions in Korea, between 1950 and 1953. He received the award on September 23, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before that, the medal was awarded posthumously to the family of SFC Paul R. Smith on April 4 of 2005. For his actions in Iraq in 2003, bravely holding the enemy at bay so that the wounded could be safely carried out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before that, the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously to Army MSG Gary I. Gordon and SFC Randall D. Shughart for action in Somalia in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, Cpl Jason Dunham, U.S. Marine Corps, was posthumously  recognized with the Medal of Honor on Thursday, January 11, 2007 for sacrificing his life for his fellow Marines. Corporal Dunham bravely fought hand-to-hand with the enemy and selflessly hurled himself on a live grenade to protect fellow Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just yesterday, President Bush awarded LTC Bruce P. Crandall the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony. It was just this morning when several members of the DAV, Disabled American Veterans from my district, stated very simply, after meeting Colonel Crandall, and they said this was his comment when they said congratulations; thank you for what you did for our Nation. His comment was this, he just did what his country asked him to do. He was a volunteer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the history, there have been 19 double recipients who have twice received this high honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as this resolution so clearly states, the designation of a National Medal of Honor Day will raise the awareness of the American people regarding the significance and the meaning of the Medal of Honor, and help focus the effort on our national, State and local organizations striving to foster public appreciation and recognition of Medal of Honor recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Medal of Honor has touched the lives, directly or indirectly, of millions of Americans, but there are many more firsts or lone recipients of this award. For example:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Douglas Munro was the only Coast Guard recipient. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Point Cruz, Guadalcanal, on September 27 of 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary Walker was the only woman awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor at Bull Run on July 21 of 1861.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, there are four Medal of Honor recipients currently living in the State of North Carolina. Throughout its history, there have been 19 Medal of Honor recipients from my great state of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, I would like to take just a couple of minutes, Mr. Speaker. There are many who have won this award, Medal of Honor, who are the heroes of this great Nation. One I would like to bring to mind is a friend of mine whose name is Walter Joseph Marm, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not read the entire citation. I just want to read part of it before I close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe Marm, First Lieutenant, Army Company A, First Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Place: Vicinity of la Drang Valley, Republic of Vietnam, 14 November 1965. Entered service at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Born 20 November 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to read just two or three paragraphs from the citation, Mr. Speaker, as he received the Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Realizing that his platoon could not hold very long, and seeing four enemy soldiers moving into his position, he moved quickly under heavy fire and annihilated all four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quickly, disregarding the intense fire directed at him and his platoon, he charged 30 meters across open ground and hurled grenades into the enemy position, killing some of the eight insurgents manning it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although severely wounded, when his grenades were expended, armed with only a rifle, he continued the momentum of his assault on the position and killed the remainder of the enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Marm's selfless action reduced the fire on his platoon, broke the enemy assault, and rallied his unit to continue toward the accomplishments of this mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Marm's gallantry on the battlefield and his extraordinary risk of his life are in the highest traditions of U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) for this privilege to be part of this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are able to bring this resolution to the floor. It is highly important that we recognize those very special individuals who received the Medal of Honor and will bear the recognition throughout their lives, as well as their family receiving recognition should they be awarded posthumously.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="47">H. Con. Res. 47</bill>, supporting the goals and ideals of a National Medal of Honor Day to celebrate and honor the recipients of the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the highest award that can be bestowed on a member of the Armed Fores for his or her valiant acts of bravery while engaged in combat against an enemy of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medal of Honor is awarded by the President, in the name of the Congress, to members of the Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity and risked their lives above and beyond the call of duty. The first Medal of Honor was awarded on March 25, 1863 during our country's Civil War to PVT Jacob Parrott during the American Civil War for his role in Andrews Raid. He was the first of only 3,443 members in war, military operations and other armed conflicts  of our Armed Forces who have received this great honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 111 Medal of Honor recipients still living and serving our country in their own capacity and I, as well as the entire Nation, will forever be indebted to all recipients of this award for their valor during armed conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate and necessary to commemorate and honor the recipients of the Medal of Honor and to recognize their valiant sacrifices for our country. That is why I support the designation of a National Medal of Honor Day which would heighten the understanding and appreciation of the American people regarding the significance and meaning of the Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential that our Nation celebrate and salute those members of the Armed Forces who have risked their lives to ensure our safety and the safety of our country. Designating this day will also help to focus the efforts of national, State, and local organizations striving to foster public appreciation and recognition of Medal of Honor recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely appreciate the sacrifices the members of our Armed Forces make each and every day on behalf of our country. I support the designation of March 25 as National Medal of Honor Day in honor of all those members of the Armed Forces who performed valiant acts of bravery during combat against an enemy of the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="47">H. Con. Res. 47</bill>--a resolution establishing a national day of remembrance, reflection, and celebration for those citizens who so valiantly defended our Nation and protected their fellow servicemembers through extraordinary feats of courage and achievement--recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend a thank you to my colleagues from the House Armed Services Committee for leading the effort to commemorate the recipients of our Nation's highest military honor. As a Nation, we can never forget the sacrifices these men and women have made to keep America free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first Medal of Honor was awarded on March 25, 1864. As we approach this anniversary, let us reflect on the lives and deeds of those brave soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who have received this honor throughout our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1782, General George Washington started the tradition of recognizing the valiant actions of American soldiers by establishing what became known as the Badge of Military Merit. Washington presented a heart of purple cloth to three of his soldiers in August of that year, an act that was largely lost in history as the Revolutionary War came to a close. This honor was the predecessor to what we now know as the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the Badge of Military Merit faded into the past, the idea of awarding a decoration to recognize the gallant efforts of our soldiers never died. In 1847, not long after the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, a "certificate of merit" was established to recognize troops who distinguished themselves in battle. No medal accompanied the certificate and the award was again discontinued at the end of that conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Civil War another proposal arose to establish a medal, but the idea was rejected by then General-In-Chief of the Army Winifield Scott. The Navy, however, adopted this concept, and in December 1861, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation that established a Navy medal for valor. Not to be outdone by their friendly rival, the Army quickly followed suit with their own resolution to establish a similar award, signed into law in July 1862.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1863, Congress established the Medal of Honor as a permanent means to recognize our Nation's most gallant warriors. Since then, it has been awarded to almost 3,400 of our Nation's bravest citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the number of living Medal of Honor recipients is at its lowest point in history--there remain only 111 as of February 1. This resolution is a lasting tribute to those 111 men and women, the recipients who are no longer with us, and to those to come in the future who stood up and answered the call to protect and defend this land.</paragraph>
