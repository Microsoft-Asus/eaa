    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I must pay tribute to Senator Byrd. We are on different sides of the discussion on the Iraq war, but he is an extraordinary public servant who remains as full of not just passion, which is evident, but brainpower at a mature age, shall I say, as he was when he was a lot younger. It is a privilege to serve with him and to have listened to him.</paragraph>
