    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="1071">H. Res. 1071</bill> provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill>, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, controlled by the Committee on Science and Technology, and makes in order all three amendments that were submitted for consideration. I am proud to rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, twenty-seven years ago, in 1971, over 12,000 citizens and more than 250 firefighters tragically lost their lives due to fires. In response to those tragic occurrences, this body passed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act into law, establishing the United States Fire Administration, also known as the USFA, and the National Fire Academy, known as the NFA. The USFA was created to reduce the incidence of death, injury and property loss from fire through public education, data  collection, research and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have made great progress. Since the creation of the USFA in 1974, the number of fire deaths has been reduced by more than one-half. Besides providing training and educational programs for over 30,000 fire departments across this great Nation, the USFA promotes fire safety and prevention programs to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these educational and outreach programs undoubtedly have saved thousands of lives and thousands of dollars, and will continue to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reports published by the USFA provide essential information to help reduce the risk of fires. For example, the USFA releases a report in December to encourage fire safety during the holiday season. According to last year's report, "Fires occurring during the holiday season claimed the lives of over 400 people, injured more than 1,650, and caused $990 million in damage." The report outlines precautionary tests to help American families avoid devastating but often preventable accidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USFA also collects reliable data on civilian and firefighter deaths and injuries. In 2006, there were 3,245 civilian deaths from fires and 81 percent of all civilian fire deaths occurred in residences, which represents 25 percent of all fires. Direct property loss due to fires was approximately $11.3 billion, $755 million of which was the result of 31,000 intentionally-set structure fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, sadly, 106 firefighters were killed in the line of duty in 2006. For nearly 30 years, the USFA has collected data on the number and causes of firefighter fatalities. The analysis of this invaluable research allows the USFA to find solutions to specific problems and reduce the number of fatalities with our firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the number of firefighter deaths has been greatly reduced, approximately 100 brave firefighters make the ultimate sacrifice to protect our loved ones and our communities each year. We must continue to strive to prevent fires, to learn the lessons from unpreventable fires, and to properly train and equip our firefighters. It is vital that our Federal Government ensure that our brave firefighters have  the training and the support they need to keep  our families and communities safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this reauthorization bill will promote national consensus standards for safe fire fighting at all levels of Government. <bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> will also help to provide training for firefighters who are increasingly called on to handle modern-day challenges and catastrophes, including fire fighting in the wildland-urban interface and responding to hazardous material incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters are the first on the scene and the last to leave. Captain Robert Livingston echoed these sentiments in his testimony before the House Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation when he said, "The days of firefighters whose primary function was to `put the wet stuff on the red stuff' are long gone. The men and women of the 21st century fire service have evolved into highly-trained, highly-skilled all-purpose emergency responders with broad responsibilities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters in my district know this all too well. With the recent and reoccurring damaging floods in cities like Barberton, North Royalton, Elyria and Lorain, our firefighters have been called upon to provide emergency flood assistance. And we must never forget, Mr. Speaker, the heroics our Nation witnessed on September 11th as these brave men and women ran into the Twin Towers to save as many people as possible. Three hundred forty-one of New York City's finest firefighters, three fire safety  directors, two paramedics and one volunteer firefighter died in the line of duty at the World Trade Center on that fatal day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our responsibility to provide the resources necessary to train those who protect us, and today, with passage of this act, we will be providing the support to meet the needs of our firefighters for the 21st century. By reauthorizing and improving this act, we are ensuring that the USFA continues to provide training, education and the tools to the firefighters we entrust to protect our communities and our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio, Ms. Sutton, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2003, this legislation, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act, passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent, and it passed the House that same year as a suspension bill by a voice vote. This year it was approved with bipartisan support and a voice vote out of the House Science Committee. The history of this bill has clearly been one of bipartisanship and broad agreement on the merits for renewing the U.S. Fire Administration activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a prime candidate for consideration as a suspension bill by this House, and in a Tuesday meeting of the Rules Committee, I suggested that if no amendments were filed with the committee, that the House should actually consider it as a suspension bill because of its broad support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats on the Rules Committee said no to consideration as a suspension, as was done in 2003, which, I might add, was done with their consent in 2003. The Democrat Rules Committee insisted on a structured amendment process requiring Representatives to file their proposed amendments through the Rules Committee for the committee's review. Ultimately three amendments were filed with the committee. This rule would make only those three amendments in order, thereby prohibiting the 432 other  Members of the House from coming to the House floor and offering an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majority has set an historic record for the most closed rules in the history of the House. In doing so, they shut down debate on the House floor more than any other majority has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is really a terrible record. As the new Democrat majority took control after the November 2006 elections, they promised the exact opposite. They pledged to run the most open House and to allow for bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, they have broken that promise. Other than appropriation bills, which are historically considered under open rules, this Congress has had only one, just one open rule, and that was over a year ago, in February of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill to renew the activities of the Fire Administration is noncontroversial. If it is not going to be considered under suspension of the rules, then it should be done under an open rule. If this noncontroversial bill is not a candidate for an open rule, then what bill will this Democrat majority be willing to bring to the floor and allow under an open rule?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat majority blocks debates on controversial bills and noncontroversial bills. No legislation appears safe from their drive to shut down and shut out debate in this House. They promised to run the House in an open manner, and they are not. They passed new rules to make conference committees more open. Then they just stopped using conference committees and retreated further behind closed doors to write final bills. Mr. Speaker, as just one example, take the Democrat refusal to conference  with the Senate on FISA legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people were promised that this House would be run differently, that it would be run better, but in fact it has not been. The Democrat majority has exceeded and surpassed the heavy-handed tactics that they condemned in the last Congress. Now they have gone so far as to take a noncontroversial bill that was passed by voice vote and turn it into another opportunity to tighten the vise and block debate on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This House deserves to be allowed to work in an open and free manner, and it hasn't had that, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to, if I could, just mention this bill. The bill has such wide support, not only within this Congress, but it has been endorsed by some extraordinarily important organizations out there. It has been endorsed by the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the International Fire Service Training Association, the National  Fire Protection Association, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the North American Fire Training Directors. So this bill has wide support and on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would just make the observation: This bill, as I mentioned in my remarks and as the gentlelady from Ohio mentioned in her remarks, has obviously very, very broad bipartisan support. Why not consider it then under an open process? There are probably many Members that have an idea that they could perfect this legislation, but we are being denied, with the exception of three amendments, to try to perfect this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just think it is the wrong way to go in a body that prides itself being open to debate and being very deliberative. We are certainly not getting that opportunity under this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have heard on this floor today why we must pass this rule and pass the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said, we must continue to support firefighters in communities like Sheffield Lake, Brunswick, and Akron, and all across this Nation, and ensure that they have the resources available to do their job to protect our loved ones and our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes appropriations for the fiscal year 2009-2012 for the USFA in the responsible manner the American people expect of Congress. According to the Congressional Budget Office, enacting this legislation will not affect direct spending or revenues, and will impose no costs on State, local, or tribal governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4847">H.R. 4847</bill> expands the list of training activities the National Fire Academy is authorized to engage in, which will  help our firefighters manage the demands of the 21st century. These programs include response activities to all types of national catastrophes; exposure of hazardous materials; and increased emergency medical services. This bill also authorizes the USFA to assist the Nation's fire services by improving equipment and sharing best practices  to address fire suppression and prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was passed by a voice vote by the Science and Technology Committee with bipartisan support, and has been endorsed by the International Association of Firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
