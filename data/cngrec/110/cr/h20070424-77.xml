<record where="h" when="1177387200" ordinal="77" title="TRIBUTE TO THE LATE RALPH FORD, JR.">
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my former colleagues who have talked about foreclosures and predatory lending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, I also want to thank the committee that I established a few weeks ago, made up of about 50 people, including State Representative LuShawn Ford, who has agreed to chair. I come from the community that pretty much led the movement for community reinvestment in this country under the leadership of a woman named Gail Cincotta who was the head of the Organization for a Better Austin, and then Gail came to Washington and went ahead and founded the National Training and Action Committee  which still exists to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I simply want to associate with those comments made by my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I really also rise with a great level of sadness to pay tribute to a good son, a good husband, a good father, a good citizen and one of Chicago's finest of the men and women in blue, Police Sergeant Ralph Ford, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been my pleasure and that of my wife to know the Ford family for many years. I first knew Ralph's mother, Mrs. Jacqueline Ford, when she was a pioneer community activist serving on the board of the Martin Luther King, Jr, neighborhood health center. She and my wife Vera have attended Carey Tercentenary AME Church together, and I say forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first knew Ralph well when he was a young Chicago police officer. I had begun to run for public office. He was a diligent and enthusiastic volunteer who was not afraid to be associated with our campaign, even though I was running as what we call an Independent against the existing political machine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that Ralph had attended the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff added another star to his crown because I had attended the same school when it had another name, Arkansas AM&amp;N College, before it attained university status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being the excellent police officer that he was, Ralph made sergeant and outdistanced many of his peers. He was jovial, a great talker, had a great personality and a wonderful sense of humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Family meant everything to Ralph. He was totally devoted to his wife and children, and he had a great affinity for other members of his family, and of course, he and his mother Jackie had an absolute long-standing love affair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, Ralph passed away a few days ago. Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Ralph Ford, Jr, was an absolute credit to his law enforcement profession, the apple of his wife and family's eyes and a joy to humanity. He shall be sorely missed.</paragraph>
