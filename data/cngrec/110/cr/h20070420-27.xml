    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Chisholm Middle School in Newton, Kansas, for a prestigious award they recently received. Chisholm Middle School was one of only 16 schools selected by the Intel Corporation and Scholastic for their Schools of Distinction Awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chisholm received this award under the category of Collaboration and Teamwork. They were also awarded the "Best of the Best" award in part for their impressive academic record and exceptional staff, as well as their engaged and involved parents, community leaders, and local businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intel and Scholastic sponsor the awards and honor those schools which demonstrate academic excellence in the areas of science, mathematics, technology, literacy, and leadership. They reward the selected schools with $10,000 as well as other wonderful prizes to acknowledge their achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The school chosen as "Best of the Best" also receives an additional $15,000 grant from the Intel Foundation and other prizes such as computer software. What an accomplishment it is for Chisholm Middle School to receive these grants for new technology and software.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is wonderful to see families and communities come together to support the youth of America. The students, parents, educators, community leaders, and local businesses should all be commended for working together to improve education, for bringing excitement to learning, and for investing in the future of our generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The grants Chisholm Middle School received will go a long way in bringing new and exciting technology into the classroom. In fact, on Monday, April 30, they are hosting a reception in their media center to demonstrate the new technology that they have purchased with this award. That will be an interesting and exciting day at Chisholm Middle School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to maintain a competitive edge in the global economy, America's schools need to provide quality education to ensure the next generation is well prepared. Schools across the Nation are striving for this kind of quality education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is evident that through the dedication of teachers, parents, communities, doors of opportunities are opening for America's young people. I encourage you to keep striving for excellence, and you will reap the benefits of hard work and perseverance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to also note that Ogden Elementary School in Ogden, Kansas, received a School of Distinction Award in the Mathematics Achievement category. The State of Kansas had two schools that were recipients of the Schools of Distinction Award for 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud of our students at Chisholm and Ogden for this high honor, and today I am pleased to offer congratulations on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
