    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program. President Bush, as you know, has callously denied health care for 10 million poor children due to his misplaced priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 800,000 children in my home State of California depend on the Healthy Families Program. More than half of those children happen to be Hispanic. The health of millions of children will be endangered and millions more will continue to suffer if we do not reauthorize this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in Congress have an incredible opportunity to do what is right for our children, especially those children who are disadvantaged and come from low-income families. All children, regardless of race, income or geography deserve a healthy start in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to end this false allegation that undocumented immigrants are receiving this coverage. Ten million children are counting on us to do the right thing. We have a moral obligation to protect the health and well-being of all of our children.</paragraph>
