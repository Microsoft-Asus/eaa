  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when it comes to the new Democrat Congress, it is the 1970s all over again. Think about it. We have hostages in Iran, Congress is making plans to withdraw from another unpopular war, and the Democrats return to the floor of Congress with plans to tax and spend once again. Higher taxes for working families, small businesses and family farms to finance billions of dollars in new spending with absolutely no reform of entitlements, the real threat to our children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GOP budget alternative will balance the budget by the year 2012 without tax increases, without raiding Social Security and with truly historic entitlement reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say, Madam Speaker, say "no" to bell bottoms, disco and the tax-and-spend politics of the 1970s. Say "yes" to the Republican budget resolution.</paragraph>
