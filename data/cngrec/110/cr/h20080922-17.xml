    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I forgot to say on the last bill that my colleagues from California, Mr. Rohrabacher and Mr. Issa, are strongly supportive of it, and will participate, I'm sure, in helping us get the required votes to pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, I first want to point out, is amended. It was and is still a comprehensive bill that will help millions of our veterans, including recently wounded and transitioning OIF/OEF veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have done to amend it is to move this from a mandatory spending bill to a discretionary spending bill by removing all of the mandatory provisions and also the PAYGO provisions that have caused so much controversy. So now we have a bill that will continue this Congress' unprecedented record of putting our veterans first and making them a top priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would potentially provide extensive benefits to all of our Nation's veterans in the areas of insurance, disability compensation, education, pension, housing, and other critical VA benefits. The bill would only invoke discretionary spending and would not require an offset under the PAYGO rules adopted by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would ensure that permanently disabled servicemembers who are hospitalized and receiving medical care and treatment can receive structural alterations to their homes before they come home. I think this is a provision that Mr. Stearns mentioned as one of the high priority items in his previous list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also would ensure that so-called State approving agencies, and the Departments of Labor and Education and other Federal agencies collaborate to improve the efficiency of education benefits for our servicemembers and veterans, as well as establish outcome-oriented performance standards for the administration of our new GI bill benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would better enable Congress to provide adequate oversight of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, while allowing this highly specialized court to maintain its discretion to administer fair justice for our veterans filing appeals of VA decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to state again, for the Record, that this bill does not require any mandatory spending, and veterans may stand to benefit if it is passed and ultimately enacted. I hope people will take a look at the new bill and see it as a comprehensive veterans bill that will help veterans in all of our districts. I urge my colleagues to give this bill support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I request as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this bill, <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, as amended, the Veterans Benefit Enhancement Act of 2008. It's a modest bill. But it would enhance veterans insurance and housing benefits and improve benefits and services for transitioning for servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment to this bill would remove the language in the original Senate-passed bill that would have overturned a decision made by the United States Court of Appeals for veterans claims in the case of Hartness v. Nicholson, that held VA must pay a special monthly pension benefit to severely disabled, elderly, homebound and poor wartime veterans pursuant to a law enacted in 2001. I'm pleased that this detrimental provision that would have impacted our most vulnerable veterans, has  simply been removed from this bill. That's good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment also removes all mandatory spending provisions in the Senate-passed bill that would have utilized the funding that would have been available if the disabled veterans no longer were to receive their special monthly pensions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what remains is a bill that is a compilation of numerous veteran benefit provisions. Among these, I'd like to highlight just a few that will benefit our servicemembers and our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would ensure that severely disabled servicemembers can receive structural alterations to their homes prior to discharge from active duty. Right now, even if they know they are going to be discharged, they must wait until discharge to receive this very necessary housing benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would expand SGLI to include certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve for the first  time. It would allow the termination or suspension of cellular telephone contracts upon the request of servicemembers undergoing deployment outside the United States. That is good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Madam Speaker, the legislation would improve the administration of veterans' education and employment programs and of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, passage of this manager's amendment will provide improved benefits to our Nation's veterans. These heroes have sacrificed so much for our Nation's, freedom and we must ensure that their needs are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to support the bill as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my gratitude to all the men and women who have served and are currently serving in our Armed Forces. It is there courage and sacrifice that has paved for the rights and freedoms we enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since September 2001, more than 1,700,000 members of the Armed Forces have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and nearly 611,000 have been deployed more than once. Many of our men and women in the armed forces have given the ultimate sacrifice to secure the freedoms of others. As of May 3, 2008 over 4,500 died and over 32,000 wounded while deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The members of our Armed Forces and their families deserve all the medical, financial, education, and moral support that our Nation can provide. The resolution we considered today provides an opportunity for each of us, regardless of political views, religion, ethnicity, gender, or background to come together, and to recognize and honor our nation's heroes and those that support them and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though we may be divided by our positions on the war in Iraq, we stand together to support our veterans. Our nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country. We must be united in seeing that every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine is welcomed back with all the care and compassion this grateful nation can bestow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All too many of our veterans are left without the help and support they need to transition from the horrors they bravely face on the front lines of battle to successful civilian life. According to the Veteran's Affairs Department, as of 2006, on any given night, 196,000 veterans of all ages were homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The V.A. also reports 400 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan alone have already become homeless, and this figure only takes into account those who have sought services from V.A.-sponsored programs. Experts have predicted that the trauma resulting from the extreme horrors of these modern wars could lead to a surge in homeless veterans in the coming years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though I have opposed the war in Iraq from its inception, I remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we recognize, celebrate, and honor the service of our sons and daughters in and returning from, Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> by my colleague in the Senate, Senator Akaka. I firmly believe that we should celebrate and support our armed forces and their families, and I remain committed, as a Member of Congress, to both meeting the needs of veterans of previous wars, and to provide a fitting welcome home to those who are now serving. Current serving military personnel and veterans have kept their promise to serve our nation; they have willingly risked their lives to protect the country  we all love. We must now ensure that we keep our promises to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Veteran's Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 will assist with: life insurance issues, housing matters; better coordination and more money for educational work recognition of the contribution of Filipino World War II Veterans, assists retired judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Court, adds osteoporosis to the list of diseases presumed to be service-oriented and therefore compensable with respect to former Prisoners of War (POWs), authorizes supplemental benefits for burial  and funeral expenses of veterans, provides for specially adapted housing assistance for disabled veterans whose disability due to severe burn injury, assistance in the purchases of automobiles for disabled veterans, authorizes the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to maintain and manage the assets (including electronic data files and biological specimens of study participants) transferred to the Agency from the Air Force Health Study. Also, for them to conduct additional research toward the goal of understanding the determinants of health, and promoting wellness,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are over 25 million veterans in the United States. There are more than 1,633,000 veterans living in Texas and more than 32,000 veterans living in my Congressional district alone. I hope we will all take the time to show appreciation to those who have answered the call to duty. As the Winston Churchill famously stated, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting our troops, their families, and those groups that are working to support them.</paragraph>
