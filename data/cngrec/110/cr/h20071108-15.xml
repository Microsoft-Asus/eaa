    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, everybody knows that the key to America's future is providing an excellent education for our children. As a former schoolteacher myself, it gives me great pleasure to recognize four schools from my congressional district, Ohio's First, which have truly lived up to this commitment. Elm Avenue Primary School, Hilltop Primary School, Our Lady of Visitation, and St. James School in White Oak have recently been named 2007 Blue Ribbon Schools of Excellence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Achieving test results in the top 10 percent of the State is truly an accomplishment. Some, like St. James, have received it in the past. On Monday, I presented them a flag that was flown in their honor over this very building, and the atmosphere was really electric. These kids were filled with enthusiasm and pride for the job they had done, and they are to be commended, as are their teachers, their administrators, the parents, but especially the students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend all those schools for the excellent work they have done. This is the future of America. And if this is our future, America's future is bright.</paragraph>
