    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from Maryland, the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, Mr. Blunt, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the House will meet at 12 noon in pro forma session. No legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday the House will meet at 10:30 for morning hour business and noon for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of those bills will be made available by the close of business tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday the House will meet at 10 a.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday no votes are expected, assuming we complete our business scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We'll consider <bill type="h" number="1429">H.R. 1429</bill>, the Head Start reauthorization bill; <bill type="h" number="1867">H.R. 1867</bill>, the National Science Foundation reauthorization bill; <bill type="h" number="1868">H.R. 1868</bill>, the NIST reauthorization bill; and <bill type="h" number="1592">H.R. 1592</bill>, the Local Law Enforcement and Hate Crimes Prevention Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information. And on the discussion of Tuesday, I want to say, first of all, I appreciate the early information you were able to give us on Monday and Tuesday, and wonder, as Members are planning on traveling either Monday or Tuesday, if you have any further sense of when votes may occur on Tuesday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Votes could occur as early as 12 noon. It will be a full day. Even though we are not here Monday, usually you're in 6:30 the next day. But because of the shortness of the week, we will be in, as I indicated, at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour and then 12 for business. There could be votes as early as 12 noon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that, and I think that is helpful to Members to know where the leader is headed on that topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two bills you mentioned for next week. I know the local law enforcement, the hate crimes, some of our Members are beginning to be, I think, concerned about this bill, refer to it as a thought crimes bill. But there was a long markup in committee, lots of amendments, and I am thinking on that bill we're hopeful that we can have the same kind of opportunity for a wide-ranging discussion on the floor that the committee had; and on both that and the Head Start bill, we are hoping for a rule that  allows that. I wonder if the gentleman has any sense of what the rule on those two bills will look like.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The answer is I have not talked to Rules Committee Chairman  Slaughter about the specific nature of those rules. But, as you know, the Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on the Head Start bill and two science bills on Tuesday, and they will do the rules then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We'll do the hate crimes bill rule later in the week, probably Wednesday, for consideration on Thursday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I understand the gentleman's observation that there was significant debate on both these bills. There are issues that a number of people want to raise on the floor, and I would think that the committee would want to try to make in order some amendments to accomplish that objective.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I certainly hope so. And I think the time that this took, and the bill on hate crimes or thought crimes, whatever we decide to refer to it as in the coming days, the markup there would indicate a lot of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the supplemental that we voted on last week, Mr. Leader, do we have a sense of when that will go to the White House or how quickly that bill will come back? And would you expect us to deal with a return? I mean, we all expect the President to veto this particular supplemental. Would it be your sense that we would likely deal with that next week as well?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Obviously, to some degree, that is dependent upon how quickly the President acts. Obviously, he has a number of days to act. But our presumption is he will act soon. And one of the reasons that we have put the time of 12 noon, I mean, it depends upon how early in the day he vetoes that bill. We may have it back here very soon. I talked to the majority leader in the Senate just an hour ago. It's his expectation that that vote will occur today. It's our expectation that we will send  the bill down either late Monday, obviously the funeral is occurring and people won't be here, or very, very early Tuesday so that the President will have it Tuesday. And then it will depend upon how soon the President acts. But it would be our expectation that we would act quickly on any action the President took if he vetoes the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, of course, as you know, are hopeful that he will sign the bill. We think it gives all the money for the troops that the President has asked for, and then some additional monies, and it does not either micromanage the troops or set any precipitous withdrawal dates. But obviously the President has expressed a contrary opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think you're right; I think the expectation, based upon the President's representation, is that he is going to veto that bill if it comes to him, and we will have to consider that veto.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>This bill has been, of course, very widely debated, pretty divisive in our points of view on it. A couple of our Members voted with you. A number of your Members voted with us against the bill. But I am certainly in agreement with the gentleman's view that we should pursue whatever next steps are there as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to say to the gentleman that I, and I know others on our side, a significant number of others on our side, are eager to work with the majority and the White House both, and get this issue resolved so that our troops are appropriately funded. We can move on to the other appropriations work. And some of these issues, I am sure, are going to be available to the other appropriations bills as topics of discussion that don't necessarily need to be resolved immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the topic of rules, on the bill that was considered on Tuesday, the science bill, we had an open rule on that. But the deadline to file an amendment, a potential amendment, was last Friday. Obviously, Friday was a travel day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Normally the deadline would have been sometime the day before the bill was taken up, and I am hopeful that we are not seeing that as a pattern; that we'll still give maximum time for Members to look at legislation, to be able to file a bill. And obviously, if you've got a rule that requires looking at the amendments, you have to have the amendments in before the Rules Committee can meet. But a Friday deadline, when no one was here anyway, on a bill to be handled on Tuesday, seemed to me to be  outside of the norm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And I hope that the gentleman's response is that it is outside the norm and not a new view of a very limited, needlessly limited, time to file amendments. And I would be glad to hear your response to that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, as you know, that bill was scheduled for consideration last week. We did not get to that bill. We took it off the calendar.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think I am talking about the other science bill. Not the one that was scheduled on Friday, but the one that was the teachers bill also had a Friday deadline.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me find out.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I believe that is the case. Maybe we could let our staff sort this out.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am not sure of the exact sequencing. But let me say this in answer to your question, because your question was really not necessarily about this specific bill, but about general process.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>It was.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Clearly, we are trying to pursue a process which gives notice to Members about what they are going to consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you noted, I hope, we waited the full 24 hours on the supplemental conference report so that Members will have the full 24 hours. And as a matter of fact, we were almost to the hour at 5:50 p.m. yesterday. And although there were some Members whom it had caused a problem to because of their schedules, we had said we were going to give 24 hours' notice, and we did give 24 hours' notice, and we want to continue to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the amending process, obviously, we are going to many times require that amendments be filed timely so that Members have an opportunity to see what amendments are going to be asked of the Rules Committee. But we will pursue what we believe to be, and hope in consultation with you, is a reasonable time frame to expect people to notice their amendments. Clearly, they have to be out of committee. Clearly, they have to have time to see the bill and prepare amendments. But we want to have amendments  in many instances noted so that the membership can know what they are considering.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that and I appreciate your commitment to consultation. Our staffs can look at which of these two Science Committee bills that we are talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, my concern would be that we give Members maximum opportunity to file a bill and not set a deadline on a travel day for a bill that is not going to be on the floor for several days anyway. And I think we have had a discussion that I am comfortable with, and I hope our staff continues to talk about that process meeting everybody's needs, the Rules Committee, the Members that want to file amendments, and understanding that a deadline on a day when Members are trying to get back to their  district is really almost a day that the Members themselves may not be able to be engaged in that process. If it is necessary, it is necessary. But when it is not, I would hope we can avoid it. And I believe the gentleman suggested we will continue to view that in that way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly we want to make a process where all Members on either side of the aisle have the opportunity to note their amendments in a fashion that does not put them in a place where it makes it very difficult for them. On the other hand, obviously, it is not just the floor that considers it. It is the Rules Committee that has to; so you have to consider when the Rules Committee is going to meet as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although I appreciate the gentleman's observation about Fridays, I have heard a lot about what we can or cannot do on Fridays, I will tell my friend, or what we should be doing on Fridays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having said that, assuming a Member is working with his staff and/or the committee's staff or CRS in preparing his or her amendment, obviously if they get it ready and the Rules Committee is going to meet Monday or Tuesday, an expectation that it would be filed by close of business on Friday I don't think is unreasonable, even if we are not here on Fridays, because presumably their staff has been working with them on their amendment and  can make  sure that amendment gets filed even if the Member is not physically present here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend as long as the bill is available the full week before, and our opportunity at the end of the week to talk about what is going to be available, I think there is reasonableness there. On a bill that suddenly we just decide we have time to do it, that might be different than the normal procedure that my friend is suggesting.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will my friend yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Because you said as long as the bill has been available at least a week before. I want to think about that timeframe. That was sort of an add-on in your comment. I don't want my silence to be perceived as, oh, yes, okay, that's a procedure we can follow. I am not sure we can follow that. But certainly the substance of your comment we do want to follow, and that is give Members a reasonable opportunity to prepare an amendment to a bill. Obviously they considered it in committee and  they reported it out of committee, but there may be times, as you observed, when that doesn't happen and it goes more quickly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>On that topic of what may be out there, Mr. Speaker, I have just a couple of final questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is we are now approaching 4 weeks before another opportunity for a district work period during the Memorial Day time. I wonder if the leader has a sense of a couple of items, your sense of what you are hoping as major things to get done during that month, generally; and, specifically, if there is any information about a GSE bill. The committee voted a GSE bill out on March 28. That was a full month ago. I am wondering if there is a sense of when that might be on the floor. And anything else  the gentleman has about an appropriation schedule that might involve the next 4 weeks would be helpful. And that would be my final question unless your answer prompts a question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will try to be precise so that your response will be germane to my observations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that with respect to the GSE bill, there has been a reference to another committee. That committee has not reported out that bill, so obviously we have to find out what it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On your general question, let me say it is my hope during the next 30 days prior to the Memorial Day break there will be a number of significant things we will do. We mentioned this coming week's work. We will start the appropriations process. I am hopeful that we will adopt a budget resolution conference report by that time. If we do not, as I indicated last week to you, it would be my hope that we would have the Appropriations Committee move ahead and mark bills to the House-passed level, as  we have done in the past, and deem its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that we would pass a number of appropriations bills in May. And as the gentleman also knows, as we have historically done, we will be considering the defense authorization bill in May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So appropriation bills, the authorization bill. There will be some other pieces of legislation, but I expect them to be the major focus of the balance of time between now and when we take the Memorial Day break.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think that is very helpful, and I thank the majority leader.</paragraph>
