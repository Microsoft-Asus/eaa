  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise also in strong suspects of the COPS Improvement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the COPS program began in 1994, it has provided for the hiring of 404 police officers in my congressional district. It has directed billions of dollars in grants to law enforcement agencies, including more than $20 million to benefit my constituents on the central coast of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COPS deserves much of the credit for the major drop in crime across our country during the 1990s, but the Bush administration has repeatedly targeted the COPS hiring program for elimination. So I'm glad the new Democratic majority in Congress realizes the  importance of putting cops on the beat. The COPS Improvement Act continues the good work we started in the 1990s. It will help law enforcement agencies in my district to hire another 173 police officers.  That's 173 men and women to patrol the streets and keep their hardworking neighbors safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge this House to pass this much-needed legislation today.</paragraph>
