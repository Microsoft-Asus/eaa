    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise with profound sadness to recognize a fallen marine from my district, Lance Corporal Jordan Christian Haerter who was only 19 years old when he was killed in Iraq last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal Haerter was from the small Peconic Bay community of Sag Harbor, New York, and is the village's first war casualty since World War II. He is the 30th of our brave troops from Long Island, and the eighth constituent of mine, who has fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal Haerter had been in Iraq for only a month when he died a hero while defending a checkpoint in Ramadi. He was killed while firing at the driver of an enemy truck full of explosives that was running a barrier and about to crash into dozens of his fellow marines. His noble sacrifice was honored earlier this week when hundreds of Long Islanders paid their respects outside the Old Whalers Church in Sag Harbor. They remembered his youth, his love of the Marine Corps, and his determination  to be the best marine he could be. He was always faithful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of New York's First Congressional District, I extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Their loss will never be forgotten, and we will always remember Jordan's noble sacrifice.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
