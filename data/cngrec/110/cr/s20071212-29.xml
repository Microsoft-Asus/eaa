  <narrative>100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PINNACLES NATIONAL MONUMENT</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 100th anniversary of Pinnacles National Monument, located in San Benito County, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 16, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed 2,080 acres of the Pinnacles National Forest Reserve as Pinnacles National Monument. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary. Part of an extinct volcano, the spectacular geology of Pinnacles National Monument has fascinated visitors for decades. A variety of flora and fauna flourishes in this unusual landscape, including an exquisite chaparral ecosystem and nearly 400 species of bees, the highest known bee diversity of anyplace  on earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Situated near the San Andreas Rift Zone with the central coast to the west and Gabilan Mountain Range to the east, Pinnacles National Monument now occupies over 26,000 acres 14,000 acres of which are congressionally designated wilderness. With surrounding lands tended by farmers whose ancestors homesteaded the region, and cowboys who watch over the cattle that graze on the expansive plains, Pinnacles National Monument offers a sublime glimpse into California's past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pinnacles is home to 20 endemic species holding special Federal or State status, and is also the ancestral home range of the California condor. Pinnacles is the only National Park site that releases and maintains this extremely endangered bird species and is critical to the overall condor recovery effort. Pinnacles is also located within the Pacific Flyway migratory route and contains the highest concentration of nesting prairie falcons of any national park in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only 100 miles from the urban centers of San Francisco and San Jose, Pinnacles National Monument remains a haven of solitude for nature enthusiasts and offers a stunning reflection of California's rural history and heritage. For 100 years, Pinnacles National Monument has served as a recreational escape for hikers, outdoor enthusiasts, and those seeking a glimpse of California's rich history. It is a powerful reminder of the beauty of nature and the importance of conservation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the National Park Service staff and volunteers for maintaining the natural beauty and historical significance of Pinnacles National Monument. I look forward to future generations having the opportunity to study and enjoy this unique piece of our State and national history for another 100 years.</paragraph>
