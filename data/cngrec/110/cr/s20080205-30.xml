  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early morning of February 2, 2008, a gay couple, Thomas Colonna and Brad Crelia, were walking in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, when they were nearly struck by a vehicle. The car then screeched to a halt, and several men exited, yelling anti-gay slurs. The couple attempted to run away, but Crelia, who had a broken foot, was unable to move quickly. The attackers descended upon the two men, still hurling epithets as they began to hit them. One assailant snatched the cane Crelia had been  using to support his weight and began to beat him around the head and face with it. Crelia and Colonna both suffered cuts, bruises and broken bones as a result of the attack. Police have not yet made any arrests, but witnesses have provided descriptions and a license plate for the attackers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
