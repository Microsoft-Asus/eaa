    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, next week we'll be celebrating the 6th anniversary of the terrible attacks that happened on September 11 in New York, here in the Washington area, the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we remember those that we lost, I hope that we also reflect on how our Nation, and especially this Congress, came together during the weeks and months that followed that terrible, terrible day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following 9/11, we, as Americans, demonstrated the best of all of us. Thousands volunteered to help with the rescue and recovery efforts on Ground Zero. Scores more donated money, gave blood, took time to help people that they didn't even know. Millions prayed for the families of those that lost loved ones. It was a remarkable time. People from all walks of life stood together with a renewed sense of purpose and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we remember those we lost on this anniversary of September 11, let's also remember how we came together to help get America through perhaps the most difficult time in our history. Let's remember the firefighters, the police officers, the union workers who risked their lives to save others. Let's remember the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, who became advocates for commonsense laws down here in Washington that would prevent another tragedy from happening. These courageous men and women  worked tirelessly so that other families wouldn't experience what they went through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As each year passes, the needs of those affected by 9/11 change. We work with a number of families back on Long Island in my district, especially the children, that still need mental health care. We need to improve the health care for the recovery workers who put their lives on the line and are now suffering from illnesses. And local residents, it is still paramount in our minds to make sure that they stay healthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The long-term mental health of families and children who lost loved ones maintains its high importance. Most people will remember it as being post-traumatic syndrome. One never knows when those flashes of that day come back. Sometimes it takes years and years for the treatment to take hold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fourth Congressional District, I want to salute such groups as the South Nassau Communities Hospital and the World Trade Center Family Center that have been working hard to address the mental health needs of the children affected by 9/11 and have made great progress in helping them cope with this horrible tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my office, I have a painting that was done several years ago by a young child on how they saw the world. And through therapy, you can now see the paintings have improved with the sun shining, meaning the young child is getting on with their life. Their work is equally as important as the search and recovery efforts following the attacks, and I commend them for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001, our hearts were broken, but our spirits grew stronger. On September 11, 2007, I can think of no better memorial to those we lost on 9/11 than making their children and grandchildren's world a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some will say time has passed and it's time to move on with their lives. I have worked with many of those 9/11 families, and they have moved on with their lives. But again, through every great tragedy one never knows when you'll break down and cry because you remember something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every American remembers September 11, the year 2001. Every American knows where they were that day. Every American came together to make sure that those that needed help would have it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the American people for standing together. I thank those that lost their lives to save other lives and, hopefully, we will never forget those that made the great sacrifices who still need our help. September 11 will be in everybody's minds forever in history. Let us not, here in this Congress, forget those that have survived but still need our help to get them through the illnesses they are facing.</paragraph>
