  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we will vote on <bill type="h" number="1700">H.R. 1700</bill>, which calls for putting 50,000 additional police officers on the street over the next 6 years, authorizing $600 million a year for the COPS program, and it also authorizes $350 million a year for the COPS technology grants, and $200 million a year for hiring community prosecutors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting today because today is the 26th annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service. Of all the cuts to needed domestic programs the Bush administration has devised over the years, the decimation of funds to our law enforcement personnel has to be among the most ill-considered and reckless. How he could ever stand next to any cop and do what he has done in the last 5 years is reprehensible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COPS program is a proven winner, cutting crime and making neighborhoods safer across the Nation. More police on the streets means less violent crimes and greater vigilance. It just makes sense. According to the GAO study, between 1998 and 2000, the COPS grants are responsible for reducing crimes by 225,000.</paragraph>
