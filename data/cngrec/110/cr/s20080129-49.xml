  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF BO PELINI -- (Senate - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="443">S443</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with the Senate having reconvened after the recess, I start the new year by rising to recognize Bo Pelini, the new head coach of the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers' football team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Nebraska at Lincoln, my alma mater, has a proud and distinguished record in National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, football, including 5 National Championships, 3 Heisman Trophies, 8 Outland Trophies, 93 Academic All-Americans, and other impressive records and awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nebraskans statewide are united behind their Cornhuskers and will undoubtedly welcome Coach Pelini at Memorial Stadium with an NCAA-record 290th consecutive sellout for his first home game on August 30, 2008. Husker fans' optimism has been renewed with the hiring of Coach Pelini, who we hope will build our program back to its glory days, which were marked not only by athletic success on the field, but also academic success in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I joined many of my fellow Cornhusker fans on January 7, 2008, in celebrating the 38-24 victory of Louisiana State University, LSU, over Ohio State University in the Bowl Championship Series National Championship Game. Our partisanship was directed more at LSU's then-defensive coordinator, Bo Pelini, than it was for the team itself. Although Coach Pelini had already been hired as Nebraska's new head coach, he honorably chose to finish his commitment at LSU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Pelini and the Tigers came through as champions, further encouraging Nebraska fans everywhere that the Big Red can return to national prominence under our new leader. We look forward enthusiastically to the annual Red/White Spring Game and the start of the fall collegiate football season. On behalf of my fellow Huskers, I welcome Coach Bo Pelini with a resounding, "Go Big Red!" or perhaps, even more appropriately, "Bo Big Red!"</paragraph>
