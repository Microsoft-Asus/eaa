    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my great privilege to pay tribute to Alexander McGregor Dao Doane as he celebrates his first birthday on February 17, 2007, with his parents, W. Allen and Christina Doane. This is the couple's first child, born at 11:44 a.m. at the Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. At birth, Alexander was 7 pounds 9 1/2  ounces and 20 inches long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being happy and fulfilled parents, the Doanes are pillars in Hawaii's corporate leadership circle. Allen is chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Alexander and Baldwin. Founded in 1870, it is one of the oldest and most prestigious companies operating in Hawaii, with its primary focus in real estate development, ocean cargo carriage and sugar production. Christina was born in Saigon, Vietnam, and immigrated to Hawaii as a child where she would earn her bachelor's  degree from the University of Hawaii, a master's in business administration from Hawaii Pacific University, and enter the field of corporate marketing. She is presently enjoying the full-time joys of motherhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To give you some sense of the depth of the Doanes' commitment to our community, 8 days after Alex's birth, on February 25, 2006, as the event cochairs, Allen and Christina, hosted the American Heart Association's Heart Ball. With more than 1,200 guests in attendance, $792,000 was raised for this worthy charity. They never skipped a beat. I am very proud to call Allen and Christina, and now Alex, my constituents from the great State of Hawaii.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alexander is named for one of the founders of Alexander and Baldwin, Samuel Thomas Alexander. He was described as "outgoing and adventurous, the idea man." Who knows what the future will hold for Alexander McGregor Dao Doane. It is no happenstance that Alexander and Baldwin's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol ALEX. Happy Birthday.</paragraph>
