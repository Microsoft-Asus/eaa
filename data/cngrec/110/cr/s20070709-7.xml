  <narrative>MEETING THE SENATE SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8758">S8758</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it wasn't too many years ago that sessions of the Senate were much shorter than they are now. During the summertime, the months of July and August, people went home because it was so hot. They simply couldn't handle the heat in this building and this town. But that has changed now with air-conditioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still traditionally take August as our break. We do it for good reason. There are a lot of things we have to do to catch up on work at home. Senators have to travel throughout their States to catch up on things. The State of Nevada, for example, is the seventh largest State area-wise in the country. Seventy percent of the people live in Las Vegas; 20 percent live in Reno. But the other 10 percent are entitled to representation in the Senate, as are the two metropolitan areas. In addition,  we have important obligations around the world. August is set aside as a time when Members travel around the world to check assets our country has and obligations through treaties and other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I mention that is we have a lot of work to do. This is a work period of 4 short weeks, and we hope it is 4 short weeks. It wasn't but a month ago when Members of this body and the House were criticizing the Iraqi Parliament for taking their summer vacation because they hadn't done the work they were supposed to do. The American people are looking at us--not the Iraqi Parliament, the American Congress--to make sure we also do our work. We have a schedule during this 4-week work period  we have to meet. If we don't do that, the August recess period is going to be shorter. Everyone should understand that. I know I have come to the floor earlier in the year talking about the need for us to do different things, and it has worked out very well. We</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this could be one of the most, if not the most, important work periods of the year. It was reported in the press today that we, the majority, have filed 42 cloture motions this year already. Why? Because everything we have had to do--motions to proceed, basically everything--the Republicans have had us go that route procedurally to try to invoke cloture to move forward. We have not always been successful, but most of the time we have because it was simply stalling when it came right down  to it. On many occasions, the Republicans voted with us, but they still got their 30 hours to slow things down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of that, we have been able to accomplish a lot. We, of course, passed an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. As a result of the supplemental appropriations bill the President gave us, we were forced into that legislation, not only the minimum wage bill but disaster relief which is 3 years overdue for ranchers and farmers. We were able to, for the first time over the President's objections, get extra money for homeland security. We got a billion dollars there.  We were able to finally get money for the gulf, $7 billion. The President had gone there 22 times, but the money had never been forthcoming. We were able, in the supplemental appropriations bill, to force that in. We were also able this year to pass a budget, a good budget. We think it will set the pattern for what needs to be done this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had other accomplishments. We also have things we have to do. That is why this work period is so important. The Defense authorization bill is one thing. This gives us a chance to support our troops with a readiness amendment, which will be the first amendment up, which requires that active-duty troops have at least the same amount of time at home as the length of their previous tour overseas. This will also be our chance to force responsible action in Iraq that the President up to this  point has refused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had, during the week we have been gone, a number of Republicans of good will who have spoken out for the need to change policy in Iraq. I appreciate very much their stepping forward, as do the American people, Democrats and Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we are going to do everything we can during this work period to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program which provides health insurance to 6 million children. SCHIP must be reauthorized before it expires. I hope we can all agree to this as important to keep the children healthy. We are also going to turn to the Higher Education Access Act, a bill that will help more Americans afford college by addressing the alarming rise in tuition costs. It could be and will be the  most significant change in higher education since the GI Bill of Rights. It is going to change programs. It is going to take moneys used to pay people who provide these loans, who are getting, in the minds of many, outrageous profits from the money they give to young people to go to school, take that and put it</paragraph>
    <paragraph>into something that will really educate children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, we are going to tackle appropriations bills. The first bill I want to do is Homeland Security. This bill strengthens airport, seaport, and water security, supports our first responders, and plugs security gaps that have been ignored for far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we are going to send the 9/11 and ethics bills to conference. As I said during the last day we were here, no longer am I going to come here and hope that the good will of the Republicans will allow us to go to conference. We are going to finish these bills. If it means I have to file cloture to get conferences, that is what we will do. It is too bad because on the ethics bill, it is important that we do this. It is so important that we do ethics and lobbying reform to address the culture  of corruption. This legislation passed the House and the Senate with minor differences. We should complete them. We almost got there the last week we were here, but at the last minute somebody  stepped in and wanted to stop us from doing this--always some diversionary tactic. As to 9/11, we got another letter today from the 9/11 families saying do something about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is our work schedule. Let's make sure everybody understands what we need to complete during this work period: Defense authorization; we are going to work hard at SCHIP; we are going to finish the conference reports on 9/11 and ethics and lobbying reform. We are also going to do the Defense authorization bill, as I talked about. We are going to do the reconciliation on the Higher Education Access Act, and we are going to do an appropriations bill or more, if we can. I repeat: It is time that  we start legislating for the American people. The minority has certainly proven that they can slow things down here, and 42 times we have had to file cloture. I hope we don't have to continue doing that. We will address the issues I have talked about before we end the work period and break for the August recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recess is important. I repeat: It gives Members the opportunity to travel home and abroad, which is so important. It widens our understanding of the issues we face. Two of our colleagues, for example, both former members of the military, Senators McCain and Reed, traveled to Iraq during this Fourth of July work period. They will have a lot to report. I have already met with Jack Reed, and I have had a wonderful conversation with him. I don't think there is anyone  in the Senate who has traveled there more than he has. I am quite sure that is true. The August recess is also a time to meet with constituents. That is also important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are sent here for one reason above all others; that is, to legislate. That is what we must do. So I say as respectfully as I can to my friends, Democrats and Republicans, who are Senators, you need to keep your August travel plans flexible. I believe we can address each of these issues I have mentioned in the next 4 weeks and complete our work. The conference reports could go very quickly, but it is not just up to me, as we move this calendar along at a pace that allows for fair debate but  not obstruction. In recent weeks, we have seen some of our Republican colleagues filibuster even issues that it appears they support, which is hard to comprehend, but that is what we have seen. That is their right, but I don't think it is good for the country, and we are simply going to do what we can to move this body along so we can accomplish passage of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Wilson said on one occasion:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commands of democracy are as imperative as its privileges and opportunities are wide and generous. Its compulsion is upon us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, the compulsion to get the job done is upon us now, and I look forward to a very successful work period. We are going to have to put in some long hours, but certainly that should not be a hindrance to our work.</paragraph>
