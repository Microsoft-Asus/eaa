  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take less than a minute to tell colleagues where we are. I thank the majority leader for his assistance on the WRDA bill. Our understanding is that we have a managers' package with several amendments. There may be only one or two that are contentious. Our goal for tomorrow, once we complete the Iraq votes, is to go to the managers' package without the contentious one or two amendments in it. By the way, I don't think any of them are contentious, but one Senator  is saying they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will adopt that managers' package hopefully by a voice vote, and then if it is necessary to have a recorded vote on these one or two additional amendments, we will do that and then move to final passage of WRDA, something we can be very proud of after 7 long years of not having a bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues in advance for their cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the Senator who may have a problem with one or two of these amendments, please take another hard look because they are noncontroversial, and I hope that Senator can join with us. We can finish this bill tomorrow in the very early afternoon or the late morning, and both sides can be very proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is a bill that is endorsed by just about everyone in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues, our intention is to conclude this bill tomorrow. Senator Inhofe and I are very strongly interested in concluding it tomorrow. The bipartisan members of the committee are very strongly interested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
