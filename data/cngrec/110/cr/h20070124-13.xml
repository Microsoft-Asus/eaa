    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, "The Democrats are stretching the Constitution beyond its limits and inviting further partisan abuse." Mr. Speaker, those aren't my words, that is a direct quote from a 1993 USA Today editorial. That was the last time House Democrats moved to give congressional voting privileges to the Delegates of the U.S. territories, and today they will attempt the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the other side will cloak this move in the language of inclusion and fairness, make no mistake, this is a power grab. Democrats are simply looking for more votes on this floor. They will say this is fair and just, but keep in mind that four of the five U.S. territories are exempt from U.S. Federal income tax laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is fair or just about letting untaxed Delegates vote on tax policy for the rest of Americans who do pay taxes? The American public should not be fooled by my friends on the other side of the aisle today. This is nothing more than a thinly veiled power grab, and it comes at the expense of the U.S. Constitution.</paragraph>
