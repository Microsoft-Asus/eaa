    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend, General David Petraeus acknowledged that we will not see any significant improvements in the situation on the ground in Iraq by September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Bush first proposed the troop escalation plan at the beginning of this year, he said we should know if it's actually working by the beginning of the summer. A couple of months later, when the troops were actually on the ground, the President revised that time frame, saying that we should have a good grasp if the plan is working by September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have confirmation from the President's top general on the ground that positive signs in Iraq will continue to be elusive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question now is, will the administration do as it has in the past and change the deadline?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moving deadlines are simply no longer acceptable. President Bush has been promising for months that we would see significant changes come September, and since that is no longer possible, a significant change in direction is needed in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for the President and the congressional Republicans to realize that Petraeus is now admitting that no improvements will be seen by September.</paragraph>
