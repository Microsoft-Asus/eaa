  <narrative>IRAN SANCTIONS ENABLING ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9190]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Iran's self-proclaimed ambition to develop nuclear weapons is a grave threat to the United States and the world. Imagine the consequences of Iran developing nuclear weapons. It would destabilize the Middle East in an unprecedented fashion, ramp up the threat to our greatest ally, Israel, and give Islamic extremists the means to satisfy their gruesome goal, which is to bring chaos and death to our Nation and world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In confronting this perilous threat, the United States must employ every element of our national power to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons program. The House will take a strong step today in that direction by passing the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, which discourages investment in Iran's energy sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Countering the Iranian threat requires a steady, rational assessment of the world around us. And when a country led by Islamic extremists vows to attack our greatest ally and our country, you better believe we will stand firm and stare down the enemy.</paragraph>
