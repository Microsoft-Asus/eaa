    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend and highlight the wonderful education framework called Character Counts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of the Santa Barbara YMCA and the Santa Barbara county education programs in my district that support this important framework which promotes civil responsibility through the following six pillars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first pillar is called "trustworthiness." This program teaches children and young adults the value of reliability, honesty, loyalty and the courage to do the right thing. It is followed in sequence by a pillar named "respect."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Respect encourages students to treat others with the same kind of tolerance of differences and consideration that they would wish to be treated themselves. It is never too early to begin to teach that framework that is centered around respect for one's self and respect for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third pillar in the framework called Character Counts is titled "responsibility," which teaches young people to consider the consequences of their actions and to be accountable for the choices that they make. Again, the earlier we can begin to both model and teach ways to make choices which lead to good consequences for a young person's life, the better the results can be for them and for those with whom they associate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have the pillar of Character Counts that is labeled "fairness," and that is easy to see but it is hard to teach. It is taught by repetition on a playground, in a classroom, by following rules and understanding why rules are established, to be open-minded and not to take advantage of others, to learn to wait for one's turn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we come to the pillar of responsibility called "caring." Caring can be described in so many ways, but again, we learn to be caring individuals by seeing how others care for us and we begin to experience compassion, gratitude, forgiveness. These are behaviors that we want to repeat with young people over and over again until they become second-hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we come to the sixth pillar in this framework called Character Counts which is labeled "citizenship." Here we teach students the merits of getting involved in making a community an environment, a place where they would want to live and be themselves and where they can see the benefits for those they care about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last October I had a chance to see Character Counts firsthand in my district on two separate occasions. I attended the Fifth Annual Civic Mission of Schools Forum sponsored by the county schools office. I also was part of the Santa Barbara YMCA Character Counts event where each of these promoted these six pillars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to particularly thank Art Fisher for his dedication and his tireless work toward civic education at the Santa Barbara County Education Office. I know that the work he is doing to teach our children the value of responsibility, respect, honesty and compassion is remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want also to highlight the work of Aaron Martinez at the Santa Barbara YMCA in promoting the very same program for children as young as 2 and 3 years old, stretching all the way through every age of life, which is what the YMCA is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By promoting these six pillars of Character Counts, the YMCA gives our children, our young people, lifelong tools for success, and of course, our children will be the leaders of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these lessons are invaluable, not just for them and for their day-to-day life but also for the future of our community and our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told these young people as I listened to them describe these pillars that from what I have seen in Washington, D.C., and in the House of Representatives in the Congress, these principles of trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship are absolutely necessary for making decisions affecting their lives and should be important for us to model here in the United States Congress ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told them that I could envision these six pillars here on the floor of the House of Representatives, that we would say to ourselves every day that just as we want to teach these values to our young people we want to model them here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to set the example in our own House to remind our children that character does count.</paragraph>
