    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the University of Hawaii, my alma mater, and to congratulate its football team for an undefeated season. Coach June Jones and the entire team deserve recognition for all that they have accomplished this season. Their perfect record of 12 wins and no losses is the best in the school's history, and they are the champions of the Western Athletic Conference. UH is the only unbeaten team in the Nation; and, as a result, the Warriors have qualified  for a BCS bowl game. The team has been led by star quarterback Colt Brennan, who is my candidate for the Heisman Trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm holding footballs signed by Coach June Jones and Colt Brennan, and I  keep them prominently displayed in my office in D.C. as reminders of the Warriors' success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join the rest of the Aloha State in cheering on the University of Hawaii and wish the team good luck in the Sugar Bowl.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
