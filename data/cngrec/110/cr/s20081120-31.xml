    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has proclaimed November as National American Indian Heritage Month and the Congress has designated November 28, 2008, as Native American Heritage Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the time when our country traditionally offers thanks for the bounty and protections we enjoy. This year, Congress and the President have chosen to specifically acknowledge and be thankful for the contributions and achievements of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Together, we have called on Federal, State, and local governments, tribal governments, and others to come together to celebrate and share with one another the cultures, traditions, and languages of more  than 500 tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Nevada, our tribes represent three distinct cultures and languages Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe. Throughout my career, I have promoted programs and education efforts to preserve these native languages and others and expand cultural programs for children, young adults and elders. Nevada's tribal leaders and youth tell me this cultural exchange with tribal members and with those in their school and local communities bridges differences and leads to individual successes. Nevadans  can be proud of our State's diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while Nevada's 26 tribes are distinct, they share goals common to nearly all sovereigns--to care for their people, to keep them safe, to help them prosper, to protect and use their resources wisely, to engage in the larger world while being mindful of their histories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this session, the Senate worked with tribal leaders and advocates and our colleagues in the House to help tribes achieve these goals. Working together, we reauthorized the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act, reauthorized the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, and amended laws to strengthen families and improve the care and development of children in foster care. We passed legislation that helps tribes develop their natural resources, expand  their commercial activities, and encourage investment in Indian Country. During this time of war, we made it a priority to help our Native American veterans and their families--who continue a long history of serving in our Armed Forces--by expanding benefits</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this month especially, we recognize the leadership and efforts of tribes and others to improve the lives of Native Americans. But our work is not finished and we will not rest on the accomplishments of the 110th Congress. As majority leader, I am committed to work with my colleagues to reform health care and reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I hope that the Senate will be able to again consider a package similar to one the Senate passed earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach the end of this Congress, I am pleased that we take a moment to recognize and celebrate the gifts Native Americans and Alaska Natives share with all of us daily.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, each November we celebrate American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month to honor the first inhabitants of this land and recognize the relationship this country has with American Indian people. In that same spirit, I would also like to specifically recognize the nine treaty tribes that I am honored to represent in South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American Indians are unique among other groups in this country because of the government-to-government relationship established through countless treaties--documents affirmed in article VI of our Constitution as the supreme law of the land. This special status and the strength of these age-old contracts have enabled American Indians to shape this country's history in profound ways, as tribal history is deeply entwined with America's. The continued fulfillment of our treaty and trust obligations  along with a respect for the  tenets of tribal sovereignty are thus essential responsibilities of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Dakota's tribes have a special place in this history due to their proactive leadership in the Federal-tribal relationship. For example, the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie was entered into by Indian tribes in South Dakota that desired a peaceful relationship with the United States and a mutual recognition of sovereignty. In this treaty, like many others, the United States entered an agreement to end hostilities and for the cession of land, in return entering into a contract to provide assistance  with education, health care, farming and other necessities; these responsibilities continue today. During this month of recognition and remembrance it is only appropriate to recognize the special status of the treaty tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to this unique governmental relationship, American Indians actively enrich the fabric of our Nation's character in many ways. Tribal members have courageously served to protect America in every conflict since the Revolutionary War, and they have served at the highest rate of any group in the country. Tribal educational models are rapidly gaining respect for an approach that stresses the importance of history and culture as well as the skills necessary for students to prosper in an  increasingly global world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month falls in the same month as Thanksgiving and I hope this affords us with the time to give thanks for the sacrifices of the first Americans. Once reduced to a population of less than 50,000, the American Indian population is now some 4.5 million strong. Their story, like that of the country as a whole, is a proud, resilient history and I am committed to supporting tribes as they continue to build a strong future. Observance of American Indian and  Alaska Native Heritage Month honors the unique heritage of this country's first inhabitants, and most importantly reaffirms our responsibility to honor Indian treaties.</paragraph>
