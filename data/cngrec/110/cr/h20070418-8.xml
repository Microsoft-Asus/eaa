  <speaking speaker="400386" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today's opening prayer was given by the Reverend Ronald B. Jackson. Reverend Jackson serves as the minister of East Gaffney Baptist Church in Gaffney, South Carolina, a pulpit that he has filled with distinction since 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Jackson's ministry is based in East Gaffney Baptist Church, but not confined there. He has a television ministry in Greenville and a radio ministry in Gaffney. He is a prominent preacher, for sure, but he is also a pastor who has been recognized for service throughout the Southeast. He has established, for example, a foundation to help needy ministers and their families called the Parsons' Pantry Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three years ago, Governor Sanford awarded him the Order of the Silver Crescent, our State's highest award for volunteer service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Jackson has spread the gospel from the Second Baptist Church of Great Falls, South Carolina, where he was called to the pulpit, to Bethel Baptist Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and even to Bourbon Street in New Orleans, where he was assistant chaplain, before coming home to South Carolina and eventually settling in Gaffney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Jackson is married to Karen A. Jackson. They have two children, Kimberly McMillin of Inman and Bryan Jackson of Gaffney; and three grandchildren. Karen also has a son, Brock Burgess, of Gaffney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the House, I want to thank Rev. Jackson for his inspiring prayer and the Speaker and Rev. Coughlin for asking him to open today's session.</paragraph>
