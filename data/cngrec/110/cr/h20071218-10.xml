    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last night when Congress passed its year-end spending bill, our Nation took another step forward in caring for the heroes and heroines of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By including $108 million for the health needs of the World Trade Center first responders, residents, students, and others exposed to the deadly toxins at Ground Zero, we again show that we will not turn our backs on those who came to New York from every single State in our Nation to help in the aftermath of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in the new year, I look forward to continuing to build support for the bipartisan 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which I introduced with my colleagues Jerry Nadler, Vito Fossella, and George Miller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Caring for the heroes and heroines of 9/11 is our duty. They were there for us, we were there for them last night in our budget, and we need to be there in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for their support, especially for the leadership of Mr. Obey and Speaker Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
