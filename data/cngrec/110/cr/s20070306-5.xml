    <paragraph>Mr. President, following whatever time the leaders utilize, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 60 minutes, with each side controlling 30 minutes and the majority going first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I offered a unanimous-consent agreement to have votes on the pending amendments relating to collective bargaining. There was an objection to that request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of that objection, I indicated I would move to table the DeMint amendment, and I will make that motion at 12 noon today, so Members can expect the first vote at noon today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today being Tuesday, the Senate will recess at 12:30 until 2:15 for our weekly conferences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to remind Members that tomorrow at 11 o'clock, King Abdullah, the King of Jordan, will address a joint meeting of Congress in the House Chamber. The Senate will depart for the House Chamber around 10:45 a.m.</paragraph>
