  <narrative>DEMOCRATS HOLD IRAQIS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR OWN RECONSTRUCTION COSTS IN SUPPLEMENTAL -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3112]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this House will have the opportunity to send the Iraqi Government a strong message: They're now responsible for their own reconstruction funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we debate a new war supplemental, Democrats are bringing an amendment to the floor that requires all Iraqi reconstruction costs to be provided on a dollar-for-dollar match.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, the United States has spent an estimated $46 billion in reconstruction costs in Iraq, all while our infrastructure is crumbling. The Iraqi Government is also currently working under a budget surplus, while, thanks to the Bush administration, we continue to face record deficits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also requires the Iraqi Government to charge the U.S. military in Iraq the same discounted price for fuel that it charges everyday Iraqis. Another fair measure considering that the Iraqis are expected to take in a record $70 billion in oil revenues this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would hope that Democrats and Republicans could come together tomorrow to pass this common-sense amendment so that we can invest in America, rather than Iraq.</paragraph>
