  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>And I now yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, a companion bill to <bill type="h" number="6250">H.R. 6250</bill>, providing for revising the short title of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 31, 2007, I introduced <bill type="h" number="745">H.R. 745</bill> to add Barbara Jordan and Cesar Chavez. On June 12, 2008, I authored and introduced the House companion to <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, <bill type="h" number="6250">H.R. 6250</bill>, in order to add numbers of individuals who deserve the recognition of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senator Salazar on the Senate side for his leadership on this issue. And certainly I would like to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Conyers, and the ranking member, Mr. Smith, for their leadership and collaboration, along with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee. I also want to thank Mr. Keenan Keller of the Judiciary Committee staff and all the staff who worked with him, Mr. Yohannes Tsehai and Mr. Arthur D. Sidney  of my staff, for their work on the House bill and for their work on bringing this bill as quickly as possible to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us adds the names of Cesar E. Chavez, Barbara C. Jordan, William C. Velasquez and Dr. Hector P. Garcia to the short title. It is only an addition of names. It is not a deletion of any names. It is adding to the name portion of the bill only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These great people are pillars in the Nation's struggle for civil rights, equality and justice for all, and I strongly support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allow me, Madam Speaker, to share the humble beginnings of all of the individuals that have come before us to be named now to this very important bill, a bill of which we know was really borne in the sweat and tears of those who struggled in the civil rights movement. Many lost their lives in this battle. This reauthorization that occurred in the last session, and the session before is a testimony to the struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cesar Estrada Chavez was born of humble beginnings on March 31, 1927, in Yuma, Arizona. Early in his life, Mr. Chavez was forced to recognize the harsh realities of racism that all too often plagued communities of color. After his family's home and land were taken from them, Mr. Chavez knew firsthand what it meant to be a victim of gross injustice. Yet despite this and similar experiences of discrimination, Mr. Chavez was not deterred. He often said that "the love for justice that is in us is  not only the best part of our being but also the most true to our nature."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At only 10 years old, Mr. Chavez became a migrant farmworker. He attended 38 different schools before quitting at the end of the eighth grade to support his family full time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1945, he joined the U.S. Navy and served in the western Pacific during the end of World War II. After completing his military service, Mr. Chavez returned to his roots, laboring in the fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chavez was unwavering in his activities in voter registration campaigns. He is truly warranting of this honor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By day, Mr. Chavez picked apricots in an orchard outside of San Jose. And be reminded that he served in the United States Navy. But he picked apricots in this orchard, and by night he was actively involved in galvanizing voter registration drives. In 1952, Mr. Chavez was a full-time organizer with the Chicago-based Community Service Organization (CSO), not only coordinating voter registration drives, but battling racial and economic discrimination against Chicano residents and organizing CSO  chapters across California and Arizona, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, Chavez conducted a 25-day fast to reaffirm the United Farm Workers' commitment to non-violence. In the process, Mr. Chavez gained the support of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was propelled onto the national political scene. Kennedy called Cesar Chavez "one of the heroic figures of our time" and actually flew to be with Mr. Chavez when he ended his fast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 8, 1994, Mr. Chavez became the second Mexican American to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The award was presented posthumously by then-President Bill Clinton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chavez dedicated his life to improving the working conditions for the poor and exploited. He worked on behalf of the migrant workers in the western United States. He worked also tirelessly to ensure that Hispanic Americans were involved in the political process. He is deserving of this honor. And we commend him as we move this legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next named person to have her name listed on the Voting Rights bill is Barbara Charline Jordan. Congresswoman Jordan was a friend to many, a mentor to me, and an icon. The late honorable Congresswoman Barbara Jordan represented the 18th Congressional District. She was the maiden holder of this seat. After this opportunity was given through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, I am now privileged to serve, and she was one of the first two African Americans from the South to be elected to the House  of Representatives since Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan was known for her eloquence but also to many for her quiet thoughtfulness and seriousness in the legislative process. Barbara Jordan was a renaissance woman, eloquent, fearless and peerless in her pursuit of justice and equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pay tribute also to her sister who has carried on her legacy by presenting herself to the public and helping people understand Barbara's legacy, that is to a dear friend, Ms. Rosemary McGowan, who lives in Houston, Texas, today. All of her family grew up and lived in Fifth Ward, and we were with them just a few weeks ago when they showed us the remnants of where they lived. It is now railroad tracks. But we will never have their history extinguished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan exhorted all of us to strive for the excellence, stand fast for justice and fairness, and yield to no one in the manner of defending the Constitution and upholding the most sacred principles of a democratic government. To Barbara Jordan, the Constitution was a very profound document, one to be upheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 17, 1996, Barbara Jordan died too early, at the young age of 59. On that day, Texas and the Nation lost one of its finest daughters, a woman who had served the people of Houston and Harris County in State and national government for over a decade. And with Barbara Jordan's passing, America lost one of its finest citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan's voice and eloquence was one of a kind, and so was she.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From her outspokenness during Watergate, to her ethics back in Texas to improve transparency, accountability and ethics in government, no stand was too controversial or too unpopular for Barbara Jordan to take. If she believed that it was the right thing to do, she did it. She was not afraid to take unpopular stands. And she often ruffled the feathers of friends and foes alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Post, too, half-jokingly described Barbara Jordan as "the first black woman everything." And a Cosmopolitan magazine survey of 700 political opinions in 1975 put Jordan at the top of the list of women they would like to see become President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in 1966 she became the first African American woman elected to the Texas State Senate. She was the only woman in that legislative session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, she came to the United States Congress. She worked on worker's compensation and she also amended the Voting Rights Act to include Mexican Americans in Texas and other southwestern States and to extend its authorities to those States where minorities had been denied the right to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>She obviously was renowned for her Watergate work and also her 1976 speech to the Democratic Convention. One of Professor Jordan's colleagues paid her the ultimate compliment. "She pushed her students. She said, `You know, you have an obligation. You owe something for what you have, and you need to pay it back.' " That was Barbara Jordan, continuing to give public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She ended her life as a professor at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School. In the tradition of Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall, she believed that the Constitution should be upheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We honor her, deservedly so, by naming her to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, reauthorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next named person is William C. Velasquez, also a Texan, affectionately known as "Willie." He paved the way for his generation and future generations of Hispanics to empower themselves through voter registration, political empowerment, economic self-reliance and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Velasquez was one of the founding members of the Mexican American Youth Organization, MAYO, a Chicano youth organization aimed at social action. His role in MAYO led to his becoming Texas' first statewide coordinator of the El Movimiento Social de la Raza Unida, the precursor of La Raza Unida Party. His involvement with the Latino organization was extensive. In 1968, as boycott coordinator for the United Farm Workers, he organized strikes in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving the UFW, he became the founder and director of the Mexican-American Unity Council in San Antonio, Texas. In 1970, he was named field director of the Southwest Council of La Raza.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1972 to July 1974, he concentrated his efforts on building the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. That is what so many of us know him for, SVREP. Little notice was given when Velasquez opened the doors to SVREP in 1974, seated on a folding chair behind a small desk calling from a borrowed rotary telephone to spur Mexican Americans into politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Velasquez's work of empowering all Americans through political participation by his nonpartisan voter registration, voter education, candidate training, get-out-the-vote efforts, this work of SVREP continues as it began through his work. He enlisted the aid of community organizers. Together they launched hundreds of voter registration and get-out-the-vote GOTV campaigns throughout the Southwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legacy of Mr. Velasquez is apparent. Since its inception, his organization has cultivated 50,000 community leaders, successfully litigated 85 voting rights lawsuits, and has conducted 2,300 nonpartisan voter registration and GOTV campaigns. Consequently, voter registration has grown over the years from 2.4 million registered Latinos in 1974 to almost 12 million nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon news of his death, the Congress adjourned its session for the day, symbolically illustrating his single-handed effect on our political process. President Clinton posthumously awarded Mr. Velasquez the Presidential Medal of Freedom, stating that he was driven by an unwavering belief that every American should have a role in our democracy and share in the opportunities of our great Nation, adding that Mr. Velasquez made this a greater country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with him. It is for this reason, Madam Speaker, that we are honored today to be able to add Mr. William "Willie" C. Velasquez in the short title of the Voting Rights Act, now reauthorized, but the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our next named person, Dr. Hector P. Garcia, was an interesting and strong Texan. Dr. Hector P. Garcia was a Mexican immigrant who became a doctor, soldier, war hero and presidential confidante. He dedicated his life to advocating for the education, civil rights, labor rights and human rights of our community by struggling against racism and injustice. His life is an example for the younger generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Garcia received many honors during his life-long fight for veterans rights. He is a giant in Texas. He is well-known, as we have found, throughout the Nation, throughout the veterans efforts that have come about, particularly representing Latinos. He is a giant. His fight for veterans rights and his struggle against discrimination in housing, education and voting rights is renowned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson made him the first Mexican to serve on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Johnson also appointed him Alternate Ambassador to the United Nations to promote better relations with Latin America and Spain. Dr. Garcia served Presidents John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter as an adviser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor. Pope John Paul II recognized him with the Equestrian Order of Pope Gregory the Great. President Clinton eulogized him as a national hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Treasury Department's new $75 Series I U.S. Savings Bond bears Dr. Garcia's portrait. The eight Americans depicted on the bonds, which debuted on September 1, 2007, were chosen for their individual achievements and service, and, for the first time, to reflect the Nation's racial and ethnic diversity. Dr. Garcia is the only Hispanic. Other honorees include General George C. Marshall and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress honored Dr. Garcia, who died on July 26, 1996, at the age of 82, by passing a bill in August 1996 that made the American G.I. Forum a Congressionally chartered veterans organization. Dr. Garcia founded the organization in 1948, and today it is the Nation's largest Hispanic veterans group. The charter status recognizes the G.I. Forum as a peer of the American Legion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Garcia was born in a Mexican village in 1914 to a college professor and a schoolteacher. They fled to Texas in 1918 to escape the Mexican Revolution. He was one of seven children, six of whom became doctors. He graduated from the University of Texas Medical School, joined the Army in World War II and served in North Africa and Italy as an infantryman and combat engineer until the Army officials found out that he was a doctor. He earned the Bronze Star Medal with six battle stars in Italy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A disturbing incident in 1949 convinced Dr. Garcia that the Forum needed to fight for more than veterans rights. Army Private Felix Longoria was killed on June 14, 1945, while on patrol in the Philippines to flush out retreating Japanese. It took nearly four years to identify and return his remains to his family. A funeral director in Three Rivers, Texas, told the family that the Anglo community wouldn't stand for his remains to lie in the chapel for a wake, but he offered to arrange for Longoria's  burial in the segregated Mexican cemetery separated by barbed wire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private Longoria's widow called Dr. Garcia for help, who then contacted the funeral home and asked permission to use the chapel. The director told him no Mexican American had ever used the chapel and he wouldn't allow it because it might offend the whites. Dr. Garcia went on to talk about this issue and to fight against it, and ultimately he prevailed when many noticed that the State of Texas, which loomed so large on the map, looked so small tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So within 24 hours the founder of the newly organized American G.I. Forum received a telegram from then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, who expressed his regret about what occurred, and therefore he made arrangements to have Felix Longoria buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is truly a story of a hero, and that is why we stand today to acknowledge Hector P. Garcia, who will be named to the short title of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He will join these heroes, Cesar Chavez, Barbara Jordan, Willie Velasquez, and now Dr. Hector P. Garcia, for he has fought for those who could not speak for themselves to in essence have the opportunity to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation in honor of these magnificent individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, to revise the short title of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. On January 31, 2007, I introduced <bill type="h" number="745">H.R. 745</bill> to add Barbara Jordan and Cesar Chavez. On June 12, 2008, I authored and introduced the House companion, <bill type="h" number="6250">H.R. 6250</bill> to <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>. I want to commend the author on the Senate side, Senator Salazar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Mr. Keenan Keller, and Mr. Yohannes Tsehai and Mr. Arthur D. Sidney of my staff for their work on the House bill and for their work on bringing this bill quickly to the floor. The bill before us adds the names of Cesar E. Chavez, Barbara C. Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and Dr. Hector P. Garcia to the short title. These great people are pillars in the nation's struggle for civil rights, equality, and justice for all. I strongly support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cesar Estrada Chavez was born of humble beginnings on March 31, 1927, near Yuma, Arizona. Early in life, Mr. Chavez was forced to recognize the harsh realities of racism that all too often plagued communities of color. After his family's home and land were taken from them, Mr. Chavez knew first hand what it meant to be the victim of gross injustice. Yet, despite this and similar experiences of discrimination, Mr. Chavez was not deterred. He often said that "the love for justice that is in us  is not only the best part of our being but also the most true to our nature."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At only 10 years old, Mr. Chavez became a migrant farmworker. He attended 38 different schools before quitting at the end of the eighth grade to support his family full time.</paragraph>

In 1952, Mr. Chavez was a full time organizer with the Chicago-based Community Service Organization (CSO), not only coordinating voter registration drives, but battling racial and economic discrimination against Chicano residents and organizing new CSO chapters across California  and Arizona as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chavez was also a passionate member of the labor movement in this country. In 1962, he moved his wife and eight young children to California, where he founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), the first successful farm workers' union in U.S. history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, Chavez conducted a 25-day fast to reaffirm the United Farm Workers commitment to non-violence. In the process, Mr. Chavez gained the support of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was propelled onto the national political scene. Kennedy called Cesar Chavez "one of the heroic figures of our time," and actually flew to be with Mr. Chavez when he ended his fast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1991, Mr. Chavez received the Aguila Azteca (The Aztec Eagle), Mexico's highest award presented to people of Mexican heritage who have made significant contributions outside of Mexico. When he passed away on April 23, 1993, at the age of 66, he was the president of the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 8, 1994, Mr. Chavez became the second Mexican American to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The award was presented posthumously by then-President Bill Clinton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chavez dedicated his life to achieving better working conditions for the poor and the exploited migrant farmers in the western United States. He also tirelessly worked to ensure that Hispanic Americans were involved in the political process and were registered to vote. He is regarded as one of the most important people in the U.S. labor movement and in the Hispanic voter registration movement in this country. We honor his life and his legacy with the addition of his name on this important  piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Charline Jordan was a friend to many, a mentor to me and an icon. The late honorable Congresswoman Barbara Jordan represented the 18th Congressional District of Texas that I am now privileged to serve, and was one of the first two African-Americans from the South to be elected to the House of Representatives since Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan was a renaissance woman, eloquent, fearless, and peerless in her pursuit of justice and equality. She exhorted all of us to strive for excellence, stand fast for justice and fairness, and yield to no one in the matter of defending the Constitution and upholding the most sacred principles of a democratic government. To Barbara Jordan, the Constitution was a very profound document, one to be upheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 17, 1996, Barbara Jordan died at the young age of 59. On that day, Texas lost one of its finest daughters--a woman who had served the people of Houston and Harris County in state and national government for over a decade. And with Barbara Jordan's passing, America lost one of its finest citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan's voice and eloquence were one of a kind. And so was she.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her accomplishments and admirers were legion. As a statesman and as a teacher, Barbara Jordan transcended race, gender, class, and political affiliation. She was not afraid to take unpopular stands--and she often ruffled the feathers of friends and foes alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From her outspokenness during Watergate, to her efforts back in Texas to improve transparency, accountability, and ethics in government, no stand was too controversial or too unpopular for Barbara Jordan to take--if she believed that it was the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her rise through the ranks of state and national politics compelled The Washington Post to half-jokingly describe Barbara Jordan as "the first black woman everything." And a Cosmopolitan magazine survey of 700 political opinion leaders in 1975 put</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jordan at the top of a list of women they would like see become President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, she became the first African-American woman elected to the Texas state Senate. She was the only woman in that legislative session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, she became the first African-American woman elected to Congress from Texas after Reconstruction. While in Washington, she served with distinction on the House Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a public servant, Barbara Jordan sponsored bills that championed the cause of the poor and the disenfranchised. One of her most  important bills as state senator was the Workman's Compensation Act, which increased the maximum benefits paid to injured workers. As a congresswoman, she sponsored legislation to broaden the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to cover Mexican Americans in Texas and other southwestern states, and to extend its authority to those states  where minorities had been denied the right to vote or had their rights restricted by unfair registration practices, such as literacy tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She gained national prominence for the position she took and the statement she made at the 1974 impeachment hearing of President Richard Nixon. In casting her "yes" vote, Jordan stated, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, she was the first African-American woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. She would deliver the keynote address again at the Democratic National Convention in 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Jimmy Carter considered her for Attorney General and U.N. Ambassador, but she chose to remain in Congress. She seriously considered challenging Sen. John Tower in 1978, but became ill and retired from politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Jordan left Congress in 1979 to become Professor Jordan when she joined the faculty of the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. President Johnson was a mentor to Jordan. Fittingly, Professor Jordan held the endowed Lyndon B. Johnson Centennial Chair in National Policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Professor Jordan's colleagues paid her this ultimate compliment: "She pushed her students. She said, `you know, you have an obligation. You owe something for what you have and you need to pay it back.' And I think they all caught that passion that she had for public service."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professor Jordan, reflecting on her service in Congress, offered this pearl: "One sometimes gets the feeling that the Washington politician feels that all wisdom resides in the nation's capital. That is not the view of the people on the outside, the people I am now working with and communicating with. Distance has a way of lessening the impact of what the Federal Government does." Few truer words have ever been spoken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a distinguished professor at the LBJ School, Professor Jordan was able to have a major influence on the next generation of public officials. She impressed her students with her intellect and ability to inspire them to achieve excellence in the classroom, and to be committed to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan was a lawyer, legislator, scholar, author, and presidential adviser. She was immensely gifted, and used every bit of her talent and skill to address, improve, and dignify the conditions of human life. In the tradition of Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, and Thurgood Marshall, she challenged the Federal Government and the American people to uphold the principles set forth in the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we honor Barbara Jordan by including her name on the Voting Rights Act, an Act up which she personally worked. She sponsored legislation to broaden the Voting Rights Act of 1965 so that its promises would be extended to all Americans. For this, we celebrate her and her legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William C. Vel&#xE1;squez, affectionately known as "Willie," paved the way for his generation and future generations of Hispanics to empower themselves through voter registration, political empowerment, economic self-reliance, and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Vel&#xE1;squez was one of the founding members of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), a Chicano youth organization aimed at social action. His role in MAYO led to becoming Texas' first statewide Coordinator of El Movimiento Social de la Raza Unida, the precursor of La Ram Unida Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His involvement with Latino organizations was extensive. In 1968, as Boycott Coordinator for the United Farm Workers (UFW), he organized strikes at the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. After leaving the UFW he became the founder and director of the Mexican American Unity Council in San Antonio, Texas. In 1970, he was named Field Director of the Southwest Council of La Raza.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1972 to July 1974, he concentrated his efforts on building the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP). Little notice was taken when Vel&#xE1;squez opened the doors to SVREP in 1974, seated on a folding chair; behind a small desk calling from a borrowed rotary telephone to spur Mexican Americans into politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SVREP continues Mr. Vel&#xE1;squez's work of empowering all Americans, through political participation, by its nonpartisan voter registration, voter education, candidate training, and get-out-the-vote efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He enlisted the aid of community organizers, together they launched hundreds of voter registration and get-the-vote-out (GOTV) campaigns throughout the southwest. The legacy of Mr. Vel&#xE1;squez is apparent--since its inception, SVREP has cultivated 50,000 community leaders, successfully litigated 85 voting rights law suits and has conducted 2,300 nonpartisan, voter registration and GOTV campaigns. Consequently, voter registration has grown over the years from 2.4 million registered Latinos  in 1974 to almost 12 million nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The groundbreaking work of Mr. Vel&#xE1;squez and his associates created opportunities for Hispanics to enter into the political arena, and gain a voice for a significant community in American society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon news of his death, the Congress adjourned its session for the day, symbolically illustrating, his single-handed effect on our political process. President Clinton posthumously awarded Mr. Vel&#xE1;squez the Presidential Medal of Freedom, stating that he "was driven by an unwavering belief that every American should have a role in our democracy and a share in the opportunities of our great Nation," adding that Vel&#xE1;squez "made this a greater country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Presidential Medal of Freedom, in the words of President Clinton, celebrates those who have changed America for the better and who embody the best qualities in our national character. His contributions will broaden the historical understanding of the development and struggle of the Hispanic community of the United States and further serve to increase awareness of the influence of Hispanics on our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is indeed fitting that we include the name William "Willie" C. Vel&#xE1;squez in the short title of the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hector P. Garcia was a Mexican immigrant refugee who became a doctor, soldier, war hero and presidential confident. He dedicated his life to advocating education, civil rights, labor rights and human rights of our community by struggling against racism and injustice. His life is an example for younger generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Garcia received many honors during his lifelong fight for veterans' rights and his struggle against discrimination in housing, jobs, education and voting rights. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson made him the first Mexican American to serve on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Johnson also appointed him alternate ambassador to the United Nations to promote better relations with Latin America and Spain. Dr. Garcia served Presidents John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter as an adviser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Pope John Paul II recognized him with the Equestrian Order of Pope Gregory the Great. President Bill Clinton eulogized him as a national hero. The Treasury Department's new $75 Series I U.S. Savings Bond bears Dr. Garcia's portrait. The eight Americans depicted on the bonds, which debuted September 1, 2007, were chosen for their individual achievements and service and, for the first time,  to reflect the nation's racial and ethnic diversity. Dr. Garcia is the only Hispanic; other honorees include Gen. George C. Marshall and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress honored Dr. Garcia, who died on July 26, 1996, at age 82, by passing a bill in August 1996 that made the American G.I. Forum a congressionally chartered veterans organization. Dr. Garcia founded the organization in 1948, and today is the nation's largest Hispanic veterans group. The  charter status recognizes the G.I. Forum as a peer of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Garcia was born in the Mexican village of Llera, Tamaulipas, on January 17, 1914, to a college professor and a schoolteacher. When he was four, his family fled to Mercedes, Texas, in 1918 to escape the Mexican Revolution. He was one of seven children, six of whom became doctors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 1940 graduate of the University of Texas Medical School, he joined the Army during World War II and served in North Africa and Italy as an infantryman and combat engineer until Army officials found out he was a doctor. He earned the Bronze Star Medal with six battle stars in Italy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, he opened a medical practice in Corpus Christi and worked as a contract physician for the Veterans Administration. That's when he discovered his employer was denying proper medical treatment and educational benefits to Mexican-American war veterans. He founded the American G.I. Forum on March 26, 1948, to fight that discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A disturbing incident in 1949 convinced Dr. Garcia that the Forum needed to fight for more than veterans benefits. Army Pvt. Felix Longoria was killed on June 15, 1945, while on patrol in the Philippines to flush out retreating Japanese. It took nearly four years to identify and return his remains to his family. A funeral director in Three Rivers, Texas, told the family that the Anglo community "wouldn't  stand for" his remains to lie in the chapel  for a wake, but he offered to arrange for Longoria's burial in the segregated "Mexican" cemetery, separated by barbed wire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pvt. Longoria's widow called Dr. Garcia for help, who then contacted the funeral home and asked permission to use the chapel. The director told him no Mexican American had ever used the chapel and he wouldn't allow it because it might offend the whites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Garcia reported the conversation to a Corpus Christi newspaper reporter and sent 17 telegrams to congressmen, senators, a governor and other reporters. The telegrams stated, "The denial was a direct contradiction of those same principles for which this American soldier made the supreme sacrifice in giving his life for his country, and for the same people who deny him the last funeral rites deserving of any American hero regardless of his origin."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statement was aired internationally by radio broadcasters Drew Pearson, Westbrook Pegler and Walter Winchell, who said: "The State of Texas, which looms so large on the map, looks so small tonight. ....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within 24 hours, the founder of the newly organized American G.I. Forum received a telegram from then Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson that read, in part: "I deeply regret to learn that the prejudice of some individuals extends even beyond this life. I have no authority over civilian funeral homes. Nor does the federal government. However, I have made arrangements to have Felix Longoria buried with full military honors in Arlington (Va.) National</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cemetery ..... where the honored dead of our nation's war rest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson and President Truman's personal aide, Maj. Gen. Harry Vaughn, attended Longoria's funeral on February 16, 1949. The incident propelled the G.I. Forum's civil rights agenda to national attention. With its headquarters in Austin, Texas, the Forum has evolved from a veterans' rights group into a civil rights organization with more than 160,000 members in 500 chapters in 24 states and Puerto Rico. Today it serves all Hispanics and promotes greater participation in civic  affairs, educational attainment, employment, equality in income and health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1960, Dr. Garcia became national coordinator of the Viva Kennedy clubs organized to elect John Fitzgerald Kennedy-president. The civil rights agenda of the Forum, however, was not at the forefront of the Kennedy administration's platform, and Dr. Garcia and his supporters were forced to content themselves with his perfunctory appointment as representative of the United States in mutual defense treaty talks with the Federation of West Indies Islands in 1962. The talks were successful, and the  appointment was notable as the first instance that a Mexican American had represented an American president. After President Kennedy's assassination, his successor Lyndon Johnson appointed Dr. Garcia Presidential Representative with the rank of Special Ambassador to the presidential inauguration ceremonies of Dr. Ra&#xFA;l Leoni in Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, through the efforts of the Forum and other groups, the Texas poll tax was repealed. The Forum also undertook a march on the Texas state capital to protest the low wages of Mexican agricultural laborers. In 1967, President Johnson appointed Dr. Garcia alternate ambassador to the United Nations. He was tasked with the improvement of relations with Latin American nations. He made history when, on October 26, 1967, he became the first United States representative to speak before the U.N.  in a language other than English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, President Johnson appointed him to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1972, Dr. Garcia was arrested at a sit-in protest of the de facto segregation in Corpus Christi School District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there has never been a more important time to honor the great legacy of these civil rights pillars and it is, indeed, fitting that we include the name Dr. Hector P. Garcia in the short title of the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the renaming of this historic piece of legislation is critically important. These civil rights legends have left an indelible mark upon my career and they have paved the way for me. Much respect and honor is due to these individuals. I owe them a debt of gratitude. I have stood on their backs and enjoyed the fruits of their labor. I am grateful as an African American, a woman, and a member of Congress for the sacrifices these individuals have made for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, which adds several names to the short title of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The individuals whose names are added by this legislation deserve to be embodied in that historic legislation for the roles they played in encouraging the participation of all Americans in the political process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cesar Chavez and Dr. Hector Garcia followed the path of Martin Luther King, Jr. Mr. Chavez founded and led the first successful farm workers' union in the United States and became the president of the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO. From its beginnings, the UFW adhered to the principles of non-violent change. Mr. Chavez received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hector Garcia was a Mexican Revolution refugee and medical doctor. He, too, led peaceful protests to empower Mexican Americans to fight legal and political battles against discrimination through his founding of the American GI Forum. He was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan in 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Jordan was the first African-American woman to serve in the U.S. Congress from the South. She became the first African-American woman to serve in the Texas Senate since 1883, where she served as the chair of a major committee. As a Congresswoman, she sponsored legislation to broaden the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to cover Mexican-Americans and to extend its provisions to States where minorities had been denied the right to vote or had their rights restricted by unfair registration practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, William Velasquez founded the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project in 1974 to encourage Latinos to join the democratic process. Starting with a folding chair and a borrowed rotary phone, Mr. Velasquez's organization cultivated over 50,000 community leaders, successfully litigated 85 voting rights lawsuits, and conducted 2300 non-partisan voter registration drives. He was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of these voting rights leaders and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients deserve to stand side by side with Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, in the short title of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="DR. HECTOR P. GARCIA">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman. It is my hope that we will enthusiastically support this legislation in tribute to these outstanding Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="DR. HECTOR P. GARCIA">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, which would rename the Fannie Lou Hamer Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, to include the names of civil rights pioneers Cesar E. Chavez, Barbara C. Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and Dr. Hector P. Garcia. It passed the other body unanimously, and I would hope that this House would follow suit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, a distinguished Member of the Judiciary Committee from Texas, who introduced legislation in the House. It is vitally important that we all remember the many courageous leaders whose achievements make possible the work we do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act was an important achievement. The extension of this historic civil rights legislation passed in the last Congress with broad bi-partisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Voting Rights Act has, since its enactment in 1965, helped to fulfil the promise of this nation to the world that all are created equal, and all have an equal right to determine their destinies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the 15th Amendment to the Constitution was meant to guarantee that "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude," that guarantee was not given full effect for many former slaves and their descendants for a full century after its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Voting Rights Act changed the legal landscape and gave citizens, backed up by the Department of Justice, new legal remedies to ensure that their voices would be heard at the ballot boxes--freely, fairly, and equally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is therefore fitting that we should add the names of these four civil rights leaders to the title of the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who were these leaders?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cesar Chavez dedicated his life to the rights of some of the most vulnerable and powerless in this nation. The migrant farm workers who pick our crops were unable to provide even the most basic needs for their families. Lack of decent pay, schooling, education, sanitation, housing, and political power made them some of the most oppressed Americans. In a land of plenty, these workers had nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Edward R. Murrow rightly called it our "Harvest of Shame."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cesar Chavez organized the unorganized, built a national movement, and won a contract and a life with dignity for these workers. As the founder of the United Farm Workers, he brought hope, dignity, and self-respect to thousands of hardworking Americans who had  faced bleak oppression and disenfranchisement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the founding, and the success, of this movement, nothing would ever be the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara C. Jordan was a distinguished Member of this House from Houston, Texas, from 1973 to 1979, and a member of the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, she became the first African American to serve in the Texas State Senate since 1883.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, she and and Andrew Young became the first African Americans elected to Congress from the South since 1898.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If those dates are jarring, they should be. The post-Reconstruction era was marked by violence, state-sponsored terror, and legal roadblocks that disenfranchised African Americans throughout the South. These efforts were so effective in undermining the plain command of the 15th Amendment, that no African American would represent the South in this House until we enacted and began enforcing the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Jordan was both a symbol of that new law, and an activist who gave those legal guarantees real meaning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it came time to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 1975, Representative Jordan sponsored legislation broadening it to include Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Thanks to her efforts, the Voting Rights Act now protects the rights of voters with limited English proficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always a tireless fighter for social justice, Barbara Jordan was known for her passion and her eloquence. In 1976, she became the first African American to deliver the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For her outstanding contributions to this nation, Barbara Jordan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A legal scholar, a skilled legislator, an educator, and a fighter for social justice, Barbara Jordan's name belongs on the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William C. Velasquez, another Texan, and another Presidential Medal of Freedom honoree, founded the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, the nation's largest voter registration project aimed at the Hispanic community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his leadership, the SVREP launched hundreds of successful get-out-the-vote and voter registration drives throughout the Southwest, greatly expanding the number of registered Latino voters and increasing Hispanic participation in the political process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Velasquez, who was also a leader in the United Farm Workers and helped found the Mexican American Youth Organization, and la Raza Unida, helped others believe as he did that "Su voto es su voz"--your vote is your voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Clinton posthumously awarded Mr. Velasquez the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995, he was only the second Latino to receive the nation's highest civilian honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His contributions make it more than appropriate for us to add his name to the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hector P. Garcia was a decorated veteran of World War II, a physician, and the founder of American GI Forum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Organized by Dr. Garcia in a Corpus Christi elementary school classroom one evening in March, 1948, the GI Forum ultimately spread across the United States and became a leading civil rights organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World War II was very much a watershed in opening up new opportunities for Texas Mexicans. But civil rights between 1945 and the late 1950s did not come to Mexican Americans automatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many housing developments, restaurants, movies, swimming pools, and even hospitals were considered off-limits to Mexican-Americans. Police and other law enforcement agencies, such as the Texas Rangers and the Border Patrol, all too often reminded Tejanos of their second-class citizenship through disparagement or intimidation. Employment opportunities diminished quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Politically, Texas Mexicans had to pay the poll tax, and cope with other voting and office-holding restrictions. Mexican American farm laborers, like those in a labor camp in nearby Mathis, Texas, endured inhuman living conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Disabled Mexican American veterans were left starving or sick when a dilatory Veteran's Administration failed to send financial and medical benefits. Local school officials blithely admitted on the radio that Mexican American children were segregated. This was the Texas that Dr. Hector Garcia returned to after World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, through the efforts of the Forum and other groups, the Texas poll tax was repealed. The Forum also undertook a march on the Texas State Capitol to protest the low wages of Mexican agricultural laborers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1967, President Johnson appointed Dr. Garcia alternate ambassador to the United Nations. He was tasked with the improvement of relations with Latin American nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Garcia made history when, on October 26, he became the first United States representative to speak before the U.N. in a language other than English. President Johnson also appointed him to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, Garcia was arrested at a sit-in protest of the de facto segregation in Corpus Christi school district. In 1987, he became involved in the struggle against the campaign to name English the official language of the United States. His final project was to improve the standard of living in the colonias in the Rio Grande Valley along the United States-Mexico border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A fighter for this nation in combat, a distinguished physician, a courageous leader in the struggle for equality and freedom, it is fitting for us to add Dr. Garcia's name to the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
