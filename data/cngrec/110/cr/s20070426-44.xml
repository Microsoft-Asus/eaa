    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of a man revered as the most influential man in Arkansas agriculture. Cecil E. Williams, Jr., who passed on April 12, was respected by his peers and seen as an unparalleled advocate for farmer's interests, where he tried to save not only their lives, but also their jobs and livelihood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Undoubtedly, agriculture is the backbone of rural Arkansas and rural America. Today, Arkansas agriculture provides nearly one in every five jobs in my State, and we rank in the top 10 nationally in the production of many commodities, including rice and cotton, where we rank No. 1 and No. 2 respectively. Much of Arkansas' success in agriculture can be directly attributed to Cecil Williams and his hard work. Mr. Williams worked hard during his lifetime to make Arkansas agriculture a force to be  reckoned with while establishing workable, sensible, and sound farm policy. For nearly 40 years, Cecil Williams, known as the "Dean of Farm Bills," served as the director of the Agricultural Council of Arkansas, ACA, where he took great pride in serving what he considered a worthwhile cause: farmers and agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After receiving an agribusiness degree in 1960 from Louisiana State University, Mr. Williams began his career as a fieldworker for the National Cotton Council and gained valuable insight into the production, business, and policy angles of agriculture. After an impressive 5 years with the National Cotton Council, the Agricultural Council of Arkansas recognized his talents and heavily recruited him to join their ranks. Once at the council, he quickly ascended to a leadership role with the organization  and went on to fight for farm policy that made sense for Arkansas, improve checkoff programs for  crops, and provide better insurance programs. One of Williams' most storied accomplishments was getting the average farmer involved in the leadership and policy development process, most notably by developing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cecil Williams took each event in stride and persevered with leadership and optimism. His ability to develop and foster leadership among the producer ranks was and still is an impressive feat. His relentless defense of agriculture, and the years he spent cultivating active and knowledgeable producers in Arkansas will be long remembered by those whose lives he touched through his tireless devotion. I am always proud to see Arkansas farmers when they make their way to Washington or when I am traveling  the state. These are, without a doubt in my mind, the best farmers in America thanks to the leadership of people like Cecil Williams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his lifetime, Williams always led by example and stayed true to his cause; rarely will you find such a noble and grounded leader. This was a man who could see the big picture and still thoroughly understand the components needed on the ground. He believed firmly in what he represented and remained active in production agriculture and the legislative arena up until his last days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arkansas agriculture has suffered a great loss with the passing of Cecil Williams, but we will continue to remember this great man and benefit from his foresight and leadership. During his lifetime, Cecil Williams saw the passage of numerous farm bills and agricultural laws. From his active role in production agriculture and agricultural policy, he was also able to see the consequences of both good and bad farm policy. As Congress works on drafting the 2007 farm bill, let us not forget the legacy  Cecil Williams left behind and take heed from the wisdom of his decades of experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pay my tribute to this legend of Arkansas agriculture and express my greatest condolences to his family. He will be missed.</paragraph>
