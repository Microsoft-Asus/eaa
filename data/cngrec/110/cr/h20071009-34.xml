  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reconstruction fraud has run rampant during the engagement of the U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States has devoted more than $50 billion to relief and reconstruction activities there, and at least $8.8 billion cannot be accounted for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the reports of excessive profiteering are simply appalling. For example, one contractor was hired to build the Baghdad Police College, a facility to house and train more than 4,000 police recruits. After spending $72 million of U.S. taxpayer money, the contractor delivered an engineering nightmare with so many plumbing problems that auditors from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said that during the visit a substance dripped from the ceiling onto an assessment team  member's shirt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not only construction. There are widely reported stories of contractors double-charging taxpayers for sodas and overcharging the government 600 percent for fuel shipments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another report has a company running convoys of empty trucks back and forth across an insurgent-laden desert, pointlessly risking the lives of soldiers and drivers so the company could charge the taxpayer for phantom deliveries. Truckers referred to their cargo as sailboat fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspector Generals have opened hundreds of investigations into fraud and waste in Iraq and Kuwait and Afghanistan involving illegal kickbacks, bid-rigging, embezzlement and fraudulent overbilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has more than 70 open and active investigations in contracting fraud and abuse in the war. In addition, private whistleblowers have filed numerous civil claims involving Iraq fraud under the False Claims Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the breadth of all of these investigations and civil claims, the Department of Justice has chosen to pursue a relatively small number of cases. To promote a more vigorous Department of Justice prosecution of reconstruction fraud, the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) has introduced <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although there are anti-fraud laws to protect against waste of U.S. taxpayers' money at home, no law specifically prohibits war profiteering or expressly confers jurisdiction of U.S. courts to hear the fraud cases when our forces and reconstruction efforts are deployed overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To clarify the full reach of the U.S. jurisdiction to appropriately punish this conduct wherever it may occur, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> would criminalize overcharging taxpayers to profit excessively with the intent to defraud the United States Government or any provisional authority, such as the former Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This crime would be a felony, with criminal penalties up to $1 million in fines and up to 20 years in prison. In addition to prohibiting fraud, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> also criminalizes false statements in providing goods and services in connection with the war or reconstruction effort. This crime would also be a felony, subject to criminal penalties up to $1 million and up to 10 years in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us makes a few technical changes to the bill that was reported out of committee. Among them is a deletion of a provision providing for an alternative fund of twice the gross profits or other proceeds of the crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This alternative fund essentially duplicates and would possibly displace a stronger current provision in the law, section 3571(d) of title 18 of the U.S. code, which applies to all crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But also note that the bill explicitly provides for an extraterritorial jurisdiction. The inclusion of this provision is meant to make it abundantly clear that this statute reaches war profiteering crimes wherever they may occur. However, it is not intended and should not be interpreted to undermine the extraterritorial reach of any other Federal criminal statute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> sends a resounding warning, which I hope would be heard and taken to heart by all relief and reconstruction contractors doing business with the U.S. Government or any provisional authority operating under our control, that is, that contracting fraud not only undercuts our missions overseas, it is illegal. If you engage in it, you can expect to be vigorously prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007. If a contractor in Iraq decides to engage in the corrupt business practice of overbilling the U.S. military to maximize his profits, he will now face 20 years in a Federal prison cell and a fine of $1 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those bad apples who defraud the American taxpayer must be held accountable, regardless of whether the sleazy, fraudulent practice occurred in the United States, Afghanistan, or Iraq. This is especially true when the  fraud relates to our military and reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, because such schemes could directly harm our country's global war against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, corruption by a handful of individuals who are ostensibly engaged in supporting our military and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan unfairly tarnishes the reputation of the many honorable military and civilian contractors, the overwhelming majority of whom risk their lives daily and professionally perform their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, according to the testimony of Stuart Bowen, Jr., the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, most contractors are good apples, and the incidence of corruption within the U.S. reconstruction program constitutes a small component of the overall American financial contribution to Iraq's reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These cases often require extensive investigative resources and documentation. Having to gather such evidence in a dangerous setting like Iraq or Afghanistan makes it difficult to build a successful criminal case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, the U.S. Government has brought many successful prosecutions, and it will likely bring more. For example, Philip Bloom was sentenced earlier this year to 46 months in prison as a result of his scheme to defraud the Coalition Provisional Authority by rigging contract bids in excess of $8.6 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Robert Stein, the former Coalition Provisional Authority comptroller and funding officer, was sentenced to 9 years in prison earlier this year. He was prosecuted and convicted of funneling numerous contracts to Bloom in exchange for kickbacks and bribes. Overall, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has opened over 300 criminal and civil investigations, leading to 10 arrests, five persons indicted, five convicted, and two imprisoned. The Inspector General continues  to work on 79 live investigations, and these investigations may involve one or more targets. Twenty-eight of these investigations are currently being prosecuted by the Department of Justice, 23 of these are criminal cases, and five are civil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, this legislation creates a new crime with a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, which is double the existing crime of fraud against the government, and deservedly so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a statement from Stuart W. Bowen, Jr., Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statement of Stuart W. Bowen Jr., Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Before the United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WAR PROFITEERING AND OTHER CONTRACTOR CRIMES COMMITTED OVERSEAS&lt;center&gt;(Tuesday, June 19, 2007, Washington, DC) &lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to address you today on the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure accurate context, permit me to outline several points essential to understanding the challenges of investigating and prosecuting fraud in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, corruption within the Iraqi government, indeed within the fabric of Iraqi society, is a serious problem that inhibits progress on many fronts in Iraq. This is widely recognized by the Government of Iraq and the international community. In our quarterly reports, SIGIR has called Iraq's endemic corruption problem a "second insurgency."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I returned last month from my 16th trip to Iraq and, during my visit, I met with the Commissioner of Public Integrity, who heads the institution created by the CPA to increase accountability for public corruption in Iraq--and the President of the Board of Supreme Audit, the analogue to the Government Accountability Office, which has existed in Iraq for many decades. The Iraqi anti-corruption authorities again emphasized to me the widespread nature of the problem of corruption, which stretches  across the government, afflicting virtually every ministry. And they outlined for me the difficulties they face in implementing their respective anti-corruption mandates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CPI Commissioner told me that he currently has 2,000 cases involving $5 billion in alleged corruption. And the President of the Board of Supreme Audit has hundreds of audits ongoing. In virtually every case, he is uncovering a lack of accountability. Let me emphasize that the CPI and the BSA oversee Iraqi money--not U.S. money--that is missing or has been stolen from Iraqi programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my visit, I was informed about political interference with the work of Iraqi investigators and prosecutors. For example, I learned that Ministers and former Ministers are exempt from prosecution unless the assent of the Prime Minister is obtained; and each Minister is entitled, under an Iraqi criminal code provision, to immunize selectively ministry employees from being held accountable for corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq must make progress on rule of law enforcement, in general, and corruption, in particular; political interference with fighting corruption remains a problem, undermining the effectiveness of the developing rule of law system and consequently eroding the Iraqi people's confidence in their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq is a sovereign state. The role of the United States thus is to encourage the development of an efficient Iraqi justice system. We do this for its own sake and for the sake of maintaining and building upon the efforts made, at great cost in blood and treasure, by Americans and Iraqis since the liberation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR's specific role in this process has been to review the effectiveness of United States efforts to improve the rule of law system and to build up the corruption-fighting capacity of the Iraqi government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 28, 2006, SIGIR released a survey on this subject and found that American efforts were funded at a very modest level, given the scope of the problem, receiving about $65 million (about three-tenths of 1 percent of our total reconstruction spending). My auditors found that American efforts have not been sufficiently coordinated and focused and that more adequate leadership and organization was needed. The U.S. Embassy has responded to some of these concerns since the review was released.  SIGIR will soon release another review on the issue, updating our previous report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR has a continuing investigative responsibility to detect and investigate malfeasance in American relief and reconstruction programs in Iraq. As part of this effort, we have developed good working-level and leadership-level relationships with the CPI and the BSA. We coordinate with these Iraqi agencies whenever we come across evidence of potential wrongdoing by Iraqis. SIGIR, of course, concentrates its law enforcement efforts on American targets and works with the Department of Justice in  their effective prosecution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My second point is that the incidence of corruption within the U.S. reconstruction program--judging from those cases that we have uncovered thus far--appears</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in January, two individuals were sentenced to prison as a result of SIGIR investigations. In early February, indictments were announced of five more individuals, resulting from SIGIR investigations. To date, SIGIR has opened over 300 cases, and we have over 70 ongoing investigations. Thirty-two of those cases are under prosecution at the Department of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe that the publicity our enforcement actions have received has helped to deter misconduct in the U.S. reconstruction program. And we also believe that enforcement will be an increasingly important part of SIGIR's mission over the next 18 months. Moreover, in the course of this year, we expect to produce concrete investigative results as significant current cases come to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR remains committed to a robust, deterrent presence in Iraq as long as our temporary organization exists. Today, I have five investigators on the ground in Iraq investigating fraud. Although there are other law enforcement agencies fighting fraud in Iraq, SIGIR has maintained over the past 3 years the largest contingent of fraud investigators in Iraq. My investigators travel the country under dangerous conditions, pursuing leads, interviewing witnesses, and piecing together evidence on a  wide variety of cases. Their work also takes them to other countries in the region. Of note, SIGIR is currently reducing its overall personnel "footprint" in Baghdad in conjunction with the reduction in spending of appropriated dollars on Iraq reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important aspects of our investigative efforts is the development of  task-force relationships with other agencies involved in oversight in Iraq, including may colleagues from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. SIGIR has 16 investigators in Arlington, and we are participating in the new Joint Operations Center located  at the FBI to coordinate and enhance fraud investigations in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR's first task force was the Special Investigative Task Force for Iraq Reconstruction (SPITFIRE), and it combined the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigrations and Customs enforcement office, the FBI and the Department of State Office of Inspector General. That task force was able   to effectively pursue the Bloom-Stein conspiracy that my auditors uncovered in Hillah, Iraq--a very egregious kickback and bribery scheme involving over $10 million in reconstruction funds that Philip Bloom, the contractor, and Robert Stein, the Coalition Provisional Authority comptroller for that region, engineered for their own criminal ends. SPITFIRE continues its work today; and we continue to pursue a number of leads that arose from the Bloom-Stein case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other major task-force initiative that SIGIR has initiated with the FBI is the International Contract Corruption Task Force (ICCTF). ICCTF prompted the creation of the Joint Operations Center mentioned above, which is producing the effective collection and coordination of investigative leads and source development. Although I am not at liberty to discuss details of these cases, I am very pleased with the very significant progress the JOC investigators have made, news of which I expect to  be forthcoming later this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with SIGIR, the ICCTF includes the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigative Division's Major Procurement Fraud Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the FBI, and the inspectors general of the Department of State and the Agency for International Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR is also part of the DOJ National Procurement Fraud Task Force. We continue to work closely with DOJ in the investigation and prosecution of our cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, to coordinate efforts in oversight in Iraq, I formed the Iraq Inspector Generals' Council, IIGC, 3 years ago, which brings together every agency with oversight authority in Iraq for a meeting every quarter. The IIGC exists to deconflict and coordinate the member agencies' oversight efforts in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR is not limiting its efforts just to addressing contractor misconduct through the criminal justice system. We also refer cases to the U.S. government's administrative debarment and suspension processes. To date, the competent oversight authorities have, through established rules that preserve due process, suspended 17 companies and individuals, debarred ten, and have another nine pending debarments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, SIGIR has produced 13 quarterly reports, 86 audit reports, and 90 inspection reports. Our auditors and inspectors regularly refer investigative leads to our investigators some of which have developed into very significant cases. The Bloom-Stein case is just one example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SIGIR's three lessons-learned reports produced to date have provided recommendations on policies designed to improve economy, efficiency and effectiveness for the Iraq program and for future reconstruction and stabilization operations. The reports have prompted the introduction of reform measures in the Congress that will improve contracting processes. SIGIR is at work on a lessons-learned capping report, which will be produced at the end of this year. It is my hope that our lessons learned  reports will prompt reforms that will improve the capacity of law enforcement to deter crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with respect to <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, Representative Abercrombie's bill entitled the "War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007," our position is essentially what it was when we were asked to reflect on its counterpart at a Senate hearing this past March. SIGIR remains a strong proponent of legislation that would strengthen efforts to punish fraud or abuse in contracting programs in Iraq or elsewhere. We look forward to working with the Department of Justice to enforce <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, should it become  law. We are, however, unaware of instances where the Justice Department was unable to prosecute, under existing law, on the facts we developed in our investigations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of our responsibilities in Iraq is to encourage efficiency in the reconstruction effort. In that role, we have prompted management to seek the widest possible participation by business enterprises (especially Iraqi firms) in reconstruction. The security risks in Iraq are self-evident, and thus the risks to any business enterprise operating in such an environment are mammoth. International companies likely will not get into the business of reconstruction in Iraq without incentives that render  the risk-taking worthwhile. This reality should figure in the development of legislation that affects contracting in Iraq or similarly insecure environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> becomes law, SIGIR will continue to aggressively pursue investigations, provide robust oversight through audits and inspections, and will press for more efforts to improve contract administration, quality assurance, and quality control. It is my hope that our continuing efforts will help promote an aim we all share--a reconstruction program that is administered and executed honestly, and is as well-managed and efficient as possible under very challenging circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for your time and attention to these important matters, and I look forward to answering your questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to pay a special thank you, a big mahalo, to Mr. Scott and to the Judiciary Committee for their hard work. I am very grateful to the ranking members, the Republicans and Democrats. We cannot resolve this without seeing to it that we have a bipartisan approach on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly grateful to Senator PAT LEAHY, who is the Judiciary Chairman in the Senate, for entrusting this bill to our care here in the House and allowing me to introduce it as a companion bill to the one that has passed in the Senate. I am very hopeful that we can get a vote in the Senate and move this to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the wrong computer equipment arrived in Iraq, the contractor ordered it dumped into a mammoth burn pit and placed an order for replacements, rather than sending it back. The government paid for both the wrong computers and the replacements. The contractor collected a fee for each, thanks to a cost-plus contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Halliburton had drivers driving empty trucks between bases in Iraq, unnecessarily exposing the drivers to danger, because the company was paid by the trip, not by the amount of materiel hauled or a flat fee; $186 million was spent over 2 years to build 142 health care centers, yet only 15 have been completed and only eight are open. According to testimony, the contractor lacked qualified engineers, hired incompetent subcontractors, failed to supervise construction work, and failed to enforce  quality control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A large U.S. construction company was paid tens of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's schools. Many of the schools were never touched, and several that were repaired, and I say that in quotes, were left in shambles, one filled with unflushed sewage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least 10 companies with billions of dollars in contracts have already been forced to pay up to $300 million in penalties to resolve allegations of bid-rigging, fraud, gross overcharging, delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage, $300 million in penalties. Some of these same companies have faced such allegations during past military operations in other countries, but have had no problem receiving new contracts in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite millions of dollars in payments to U.S. companies, key pieces of Iraq's infrastructure, power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems, have either not been repaired or have been fixed so poorly that they still don't function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How has this been allowed to happen? The United States Government directly and through the late Coalition Provisional Authority have outsourced the war in Iraq like no other in our history, spending more than $50 billion on private contractors to provide food, water, gasoline and other supplies, guard bases, drive trucks, and many other activities in support of our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But consistent with the administration's overall attitude toward spending public money with private companies, little or no thought was given to contract oversight or accountability. As a result, some of these contractors have declared the U.S. occupation of Iraq open season on the taxpayer. Cleaning up this mess has been hampered by the fact that while anti-fraud laws protect against the waste or theft of U.S. taxpayers in the United States, there have been no statutes prohibiting sleazy business  practices by American companies overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have learned in the investigation of the Blackwater USA contract, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued order number 17, which specifically exempted U.S. contractors from Iraqi law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, one contractor was found guilty of 37 counts of fraud, including false billing, and was ordered to pay more than $10 million in damages, but the decision was overturned because the contracts were let through the Coalition Provisional Authority, and it was found that U.S. laws against fraud did not apply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the fact that the Coalition Provisional Authority was created by the Bush administration under the Department of Defense; despite the fact  that L. Paul Bremer, the overseer in Iraq, subsequent to the initial attack on Iraq, had an office literally across the hall from Secretary Rumsfeld, the Coalition Provisional Authority was not considered part of the U.S. Government, and, therefore, U.S. laws were unenforceable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These practices are a flagrant abuse of the public's trust and the public's money during a time of war and cannot be allowed to continue. <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007, will, one, criminalize war profiteering defined as contract fraud or overcharging for goods and services in connection with the mission of the United States Government overseas; two, violations of law will be a felony and punishable up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $1 million or twice the illegal  profits of the crime; three, jurisdiction for such cases, no matter where the alleged crimes are committed, will be in the United States Federal court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> was heard and considered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security and ordered reported to the full Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on August 1. Among the many significant consequences of the decision to invade and occupy Iraq marked by a complete dismissal of the need for intelligent planning and stunning incompetence in the conduct of the war, this problem has received too little attention from the news media, the public, and the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Most of the cases of fraud, questionable business practices and outright corruption have been uncovered and investigated through the efforts of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, Jr. Mr. Bowen and his super staff both here in the U.S. and on the ground in Iraq have provided oversight and insight under the most difficult conditions imaginable for billions of American taxpayer dollars intended to rebuild Iraq and support our troops in combat. They deserve our  gratitude. They deserve the gratitude of the Congress and the Nation for a tough job well done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill, together with <bill type="h" number="2740">H.R. 2740</bill>, legislation passed by this House last week to expand the reach of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to private civilian security operatives in the region are two important steps this Congress is taking to clean up the mess in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the War Profiteering Prevention Act will help end the open season declared on American taxpayers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill, not because I oppose punishing war profiteers or punishing corruption in contracting. I think these are critical, important laudable goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose this bill because creating a new law "involving a contract or the provision of goods or services to the United States" is a matter which must be considered in relation to the existing Federal acquisition systems, which this bill is not. Any attempt to legislate without considering the current system can have disastrous, albeit unintended, consequences which in this case include serious criminal penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As others have said today, we all agree that fraud against the United States undermines national security and there must be severe penalties for it. And of course we all agree corruption of any kind is unacceptable. Our committee in the last Congress held several hearings on contracting in Iraq and the difficulties that were faced there. And if the current law is inadequate to punish wrongdoers for these offenses, Congress should act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But taking up this bill in this way at this time proves to me that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are caring about passing a bill so that they can take political potshots at contractors. Hundreds of contractors' lives have been lost over in Iraq, and I think the widows and the mothers of these sons and daughters who have been killed in Iraq would be, I think, chagrined to hear their sons referred to as profiteers. In many cases the contractors are more in harm's way than  our troops. They don't get the body armor. Many of them don't operate in the Green Zone or on bases. This is, in fact, a substitute, a proxy, if you will, because the majority can't put together a plan to end the war in Iraq so we go after contracting</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to get good companies to do business in Iraq. It is dangerous, it is expensive, it has all kinds of contingencies, and a lot of the best companies say we don't want to have anything to do with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The relationship between the government and the contractor is an arms-length business one, with many laws outlining how this relationship should proceed. Adding additional language to the criminal code regarding certain aspects of this relationship will have unintended consequences which have to be considered before moving this legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the bill makes it a crime to materially overvalue a good or service. Under the Truth in Negotiation Act, a detailed process is already set out in which to address claims of defective pricing in Federal contracts. To those who don't know this government contract lingo, this might sound like fraudulent behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But defective pricing occurs when a company's contract price is significantly increased because the company submitted pricing data that was not accurate, complete and current. That's 10 U.S.C. 2306(a). In these cases, the government is generally entitled to a price reduction to remedy any overcharge by the submission of defective pricing data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government takes seriously overpayments based on defective pricing and aggressively pursues contractors found to have engaged in these practices, in some cases including debarment. A contractor's liability can extend beyond the repayment of any overcharges, and under current law, can include fraud claims against the contractor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But under <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, would an overzealous prosecutor be able to go after a company with a defective pricing claim against it as materially overvaluing a good or service? Maybe. Maybe not. But we, on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee with jurisdiction over Federal procurement should have the opportunity to consider this language and its impact on the Federal acquisition system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interrelationship of procurement law and the criminal law can be complicated. We have to be careful not to criminalize procurement management matters just because you can. Careful study is required to separate criminal behavior from management issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see other problems as well. Allowing a Federal prosecutor to enter post hoc determinations on whether a contract provides appropriate value to the government would have a chilling effect on a contracting officer's decisionmaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contractors would be discouraged from providing innovative solutions to government problems for fear that their solutions would subject them to charges of material overvaluation if the solution didn't work out as planned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competition would be discouraged, which is the cornerstone of getting the best price and value because prospective contractors could be subjected to harsh penalties at the whim of a prosecutor who probably doesn't understand the acquisition system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fixed price contracts, the price which the government buys would likely increase because contractors would have to include the possibility of these penalties in their pricing, costing the taxpayers money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In commercial contracts the market dictates what is a fair value, not a post hoc prosecutor's determination whether the government got appropriate value from the contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support strong penalties for war profiteering. I support strong penalties for corruption. I do not support <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> because I don't believe it has been given appropriate consideration by this House and numerous unintended consequences.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, just to point out that the standard in the bill on page 2, line 10, it says  that you have to execute or attempt to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud the United States or materially overvalues any good or service with the intent to defraud. That's a very high standard, not just overcharging, but overcharging with the intent to defraud or, in the second part, tries to  cover up the deed. Those are high standards, and people will know that they're committing a crime when, in fact, they do that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I find it very unfortunate that my good friend from Virginia has taken a position that the bill in any way encourages the whims of prosecutors. As Mr. Scott has pointed out, the standard is very high and applies to any contract, whether it's in the United States or overseas. There is nothing applied to the contracts overseas that is not applied to a contract here in the United States when it comes to the question of fraud or overcharging or deliberate deception  with regard to the contract. That standard has to be met in any court and has to come before any judge meeting such a standard. There is no differentiation whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason the bill is here, and the reason we're bringing the legislation, is the courts have ruled that there is, at best, an ambiguous situation, if not an outright gap between the capacity for prosecution of such a crime, should the standard for the crime be sustained by a prosecutorial investigation, and what is possible in Iraq. It can't be prosecuted in Iraq, and the courts found that it wasn't. We did not have legislation sufficiently clear in the United States in order to prosecute it.  Thus, far from arbitrary or capricious prosecution, we have the opportunity for arbitrary defrauding of the United States taxpayer with no consequences. That's why the legislation is here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and then I will turn and yield 30 seconds to Mr. Davis of Virginia. I will go ahead and respond as Mr. Davis is gathering his thoughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the concerns Mr. Davis raised was what if there was some inadvertent overpricing by a contractor based on a mistake and later went back and corrected it. My reading of the bill is that person wouldn't be prosecuted because there's a three-prong standard. First, you have to knowingly, materially overvalue goods or service with the intent to defraud. And the intent-to-defraud prong would not be met under the analogy or the example Mr. Davis gave because "intent to defraud"  is a term of art which requires that the actor possesses the specific intent to cheat the government. And you would not have that element of the crime proven if you had inadvertent overpricing based on a mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it doesn't mean you may not have what he's concerned about, an overzealous prosecutor try to prosecute someone without having the prongs or the factual basis for it. We can ask the prosecutor from the Duke case what happens when you're overzealous in your prosecutions. But I believe under that particular example that person wouldn't be prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, before I yield to Mr. Davis, let me just say, he does have a great deal of experience dealing with Government reform issues as the ranking member and represents a lot of government employees. And so I certainly am empathetic to his concerns that perhaps his committee might have had some insight into this bill that was worth looking at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think the key here is that this legislation is needed. You have defective pricing legislation. You have Qui Tam actions. You have the Procurement Integrity Act. The language in this bill that concerns me is not the fact that its intent to defraud; that's in a lot of legislation. It's materially overvalues any good. And I can't find any precedent for that in the federal acquisition regulations. I can't find any precedent in terms of what this means and  how a prosecutor could take this from materially overvaluing any good. That is a very subjective measurement. There are a lot of unintended consequences. And I suspect this bill will pass today, although not with my vote. But I hope we can improve it if we're going to make this actual law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think this is a very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take this opportunity to compliment my friend from Hawaii for introducing it and for bringing it to the floor. Mr. Abercrombie is indeed to be commended for this work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this does is merely closes some loopholes that are presently in the United States law. Defrauding the Federal taxpayer should be a felony, and it is subject to considerable years in prison and a fine up to $1 million or twice the illegal profits of the crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we're in a war situation, you want people to work hard. We expect a great deal from those in uniform. And we expect those who are supplying and building and reconstructing in the war-torn area to also play by the rules as we demand of those young men and young women in our United States military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill does the right thing. It goes after the war profiteering, that is the overcharging in order to defraud or profit excessively from the war. And this bill also confers jurisdiction within the Federal courts to hear and try such cases. It's the right thing. It's the right action for us to take in this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume and am prepared to yield back as we have no further speakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. We agree on a bipartisan basis that when a corrupt contractor overbills our U.S. military, it rips off the taxpayers, it hurts our national security, and it unfairly stains the reputation of the many honorable military and civilian contractors who risk their lives every day and do a professional and honest job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill appropriately says that if you plan on overbilling or ripping off the U.S. military in terms of these contracts to do reconstruction work or military-related work in Iraq or Afghanistan, you are going to be sitting in a prison cell for 20 years and you are going to pay a fine of $1 million. We think that is an appropriate message to accept in light of this problem. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Florida for his support for the bill.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the "War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007." I support this bill because it strengthens the tools available to Federal law enforcement to combat contracting fraud during times of war, military action, or relief or reconstruction activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> creates a new criminal offense in title 18 of the United States Code for fraudulent acts involving contracts or the provision of goods and services in connection with war, military actions, and relief or reconstruction activities. This new offense provides a significant new tool for federal law enforcement, as well as creating a strong deterrent to those who would contemplate exploiting the exigencies of war, military actions, relief or reconstruction activities to commit  fraud and profit thereby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new offense may be committed in two ways: (1) By committing fraud or (2) by making a materially false statement. The fraud provisions would make it a crime to execute or attempt to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud the United States or to materially overvalue any good or service with the specific intent to defraud. These provisions are designed  to prohibit schemes to defraud the United States, including efforts to exploit "cost plus" or</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions are not intended to prohibit or punish contractors providing goods or services in the normal course of business, and the legislation specifically requires that violators may only be criminally liable if they materially overvalue any good or service "with the specific intent to defraud." This provision is intended to ensure that no contractor will be prosecuted under this offense for mere negligent or mistaken conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material false statement provisions would make it a crime to: (1) Falsify, conceal, or cover up by any trick, scheme or device a material fact; (2) make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations; or (3) make or use any materially false writing or document knowing they contain a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement. This language is consistent with other material false statement provisions under Federal law, such as sections 1001 and 1035 of title  18 of the U.S. Code. The new offense also requires that conduct be done knowingly and willfully to constitute a criminal violation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new offense would require that the fraud or material false statement be in connection with any war, military action, or relief or reconstruction activities. This would include circumstances where war was declared, or where the executive branch was engaged in any military action with or without congressional authorization. This would also include relief or reconstruction activities, whether or not a war or military action was undertaken. This new offense is intended to deter fraud and material  false statements committed in connection with any of these exigencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new offense also requires that the conduct be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This term is to be interpreted broadly consistent with the jurisdictional scope of the federal material false statement statute, 18 U.S.C. &#xA7;1001. In addition, the new offense explicitly provides extraterritorial jurisdiction and is intended to extend jurisdiction for this offense to the full extent of U.S. law. This provision has been included to ensure that offenses occurring outside the  United States, even by non-U.S. nationals, may be prosecuted. Furthermore, consistent with other federal fraud provisions, the U.S. Government need not be a victim or suffer a loss from this offense provided the conduct meets the other elements of the offense. The bill also establishes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violations of the fraud provisions in this bill would be punishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years, and violations of the material false statement provisions would be punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years. All violations of this new offense would be subject to fines of up to $1,000,000 or twice the gross profits or other proceeds of the offense. The offense provides for criminal and civil forfeiture of any unlawful proceeds, and makes the new offense a predicate crime for money laundering</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us strengthen the tools available to federal law enforcement to combat contracting fraud during times of war, military action, or relief or reconstruction activities. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the "War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412200" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, introduced by my colleague from Hawaii Neil Abercrombie. This bill would prohibit profiteering and fraud relating to contracts executed by the United States Government or a provisional authority for the provision of goods and services in support of U.S. missions overseas. This long overdue legislation will help correct the unconscionable and  unpatriotic defrauding of the United States government, our armed services, and American taxpayers. Unfortunately, the problem of contractor fraud has proliferated in the past 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has spent over $50 billion on contracts thus far in Iraq to provide for support services, security, infrastructure construction, and reconstruction work. Much of this spending has been under no-bid or cost-plus contracts. As a result of inadequate planning, control, enforcement, and prosecution, the free-spending, former Coalition Provisional Authority could not account for $8.8 billion of that money. Allegations about rampant waste, over-billing, and outright fraud have been  reported time and time again, but no action has been taken to correct this waste of taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, current law does not explicitly extend extraterritorial jurisdiction for contract fraud on contracts executed by the U.S. Government or any provisional authority supporting a U.S. mission abroad. As a result, numerous instances of fraud have been committed and inspectors general have initiated hundreds of investigations of alleged fraudulent practices, including illegal kickbacks, bid-rigging, embezzlement, faulty construction, and fraudulent over-billing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to toughen the laws which apply to individuals and corporations who have placed personal profit and greed over the interests of American taxpayers and our men and women serving in the armed services. While most private contractors are not overcharging the government and are providing good value with their goods and services, others are engaged in fraud and waste, costing the American taxpayers billions of dollars that could be spent on domestic needs, including funds that could have gone  to our underfunded schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and environmental programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even when the government does act to enforce fraud statutes on the books, it has been stymied by the inadequacy of current law. The infamous case against Custer Battles, an American contractor in Iraq found to have committed 37 acts of fraud, is a case in point. Custer Battles was one of a few contractors that was actually prosecuted and was ordered to pay $10 million in damages. However, it was allowed to walk away scot-free when a federal judge overturned the verdict on a technicality. The  court found that United States fraud law did not apply to this contractor since the contract went through the Coalition Provisional Authority which the court held was not part of the United States government. The incompetence of this administration not only permitted fraud against the U.S. but allowed the perpetrator to escape punishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To successfully prosecute these individuals and corporations, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> provides clear and unambiguous legal authority to criminalize this unconscionable behavior on the part of greedy, corrupt contractors and provides a mechanism for successful prosecution. We are talking about prosecuting contractors who willfully and intentionally defraud the government, not those who merely make a business mistake. We should have no sympathy or leniency for those who purposely defraud taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a partisan issue. As Americans, we should all stand together to put an end to greed and corruption in our government programs, which hurts the troops on the ground, undermines the efforts of our armed forces, enriches the greedy and corrupt, and steals from the American taxpayer. This must end, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> is a major step to bring accountability to the contracting process.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as part of our ongoing efforts to end the war in Iraq, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill> is an important step in standing up against those who defraud our troops or improperly profit at the expense of our troops. We must be vigilant in prosecuting war profiteers, using every tool available. The President should use his legal authority to cancel contracts with those that defraud the government and be aggressive in seeking to recover lost funds. If he is unwilling to do so, Congress will hold  him accountable.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and believe it is important to clarify overseas contract fraud involving U.S. taxpayer dollars is a crime that will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contractors have labored in Iraq under incredibly severe circumstances; most have worked honestly and in good faith, and some have even given their lives trying to improve the lives of Iraqi citizens. During 18 trips to Iraq I have seen firsthand the incredible work contractors have done--building schools, repairing power plants, and working with the Iraqi people to restore critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, a few bad actors have operated greedily and dishonestly and in the end have defrauded not only the Iraqi people the contracts were intended to assist, but have also defrauded their own American government. Perhaps worst of all, the criminal actions of a select few have tarnished the image and integrity of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will create a new criminal fraud offense to prohibit fraudulent acts involving the provision of goods or services in connection with a mission of the United States Government overseas. It also makes this new offense a predicate crime for criminal forfeiture, as well as for Federal money laundering and racketeering offenses. It is my hope this legislation will provide more clarity regarding crimes committed abroad, and not less. Ranking Member TOM DAVIS has identified several  important criticisms of this legislation, and I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will seriously consider and address those as this bill moves forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Way back in 1988, I voted for the Major Fraud Act, which creates criminal penalties of up to $1 million in fines and 10 years imprisonment for anyone who knowingly defrauds the U.S. government. There are numerous other statutes, such as the Criminal False  Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Act, which criminalize acts of fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working with then-Government Reform Committee Chairman TOM DAVIS, the Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, which I chaired from 1999 to 2006, had several hearings on contracting concerns in Iraq. During the hearings, several DoD witnesses with oversight responsibility for contracting in Iraq testified about the challenges of coordinating the tremendous task of rebuilding Iraq. While I recognize the tremendous task and difficult challenges associated  with the reconstruction of Iraq, the bottom line is the Coalition Provisional Authority was under-staffed and overburdened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate this legislation being brought to the floor and hope it will provide needed clarity about the United States' intention to prosecute those who defraud our government.</paragraph>
