    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="612">H.R. 612</bill>) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend the period of eligibility for health care for combat service in the Persian Gulf War or future hostilities from two years to five years after discharge or release, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, not all of the returning veterans from the OEF/OIF suffer from obvious wounds. Those who suffer from an external injury are readily identified and receive immediate care for that injury. However, many of our returning veterans, and on this I include, Mr. Speaker, Guard and Reserve units who have been ordered to combat, are coming back with injuries that are not external. They are hidden wounds of the war, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, forms of brain injury, which  may not be evident without further diagnosis, which may not be evident to the soldier or to the doctor looking at him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the physical wounds, mental wounds are not easily identified and may go undetected. PTSD is a mental health condition that is triggered by a traumatic event which causes an intense fear and/or helplessness. Some of the symptoms for this condition include reexperiencing the trauma through nightmares, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks. We know that this condition may not reveal itself for many months or maybe for years after experiencing the event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We listened to veterans, veteran service organizations, family members, and we heard them say that their returning veterans needed more time to access the VA health care system when they came home from war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conditions like PTSD and traumatic brain injury are the driving force behind this bill, the Returning Servicemember VA Healthcare Insurance Act of 2007. It extends from 2 years to 5 years following discharge or release the eligibility period for veterans. And, as I said, we include Guard and Reserve units all those who served in combat during or after the Persian Gulf War are eligible to receive hospital care,  medical services, or nursing home care  provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It provides for an additional 3 years of eligibility for veterans discharged more than 5 years before the enactment of this act who may not have enrolled in the VA health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This system is recognized throughout the country, and indeed the world, as providing safe quality health care to our veterans. Two years was simply not enough time for returning OEF/OIF veterans to utilize this very important benefit. We are fixing that with this piece of legislation. It is a bill that will have a profound effect most immediately on our veterans returning from war. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and certainly the chairman of the Veterans Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="612">H.R. 612</bill>, the Returning Servicemember VA Health Care Insurance Act. This measure provides much needed expansion to the availability of VA health care to certain American soldiers returning from combat. Currently these individuals only have 2 years in which they can access medical services at the VA. Unfortunately, conditions associated with service in a combat theater can sometimes take longer to manifest themselves. In response, the measure provides a 5-year window  of health care for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Many of the young men and women in our Armed Forces have been away from their loved ones for very long periods of time. During this time, they have endured harsh conditions and tremendous physical and mental strains. The very least that Congress can do is to give these brave individuals 3 additional years of health care. I think it is the right thing to do, and I know that both the ranking member as well as the chairman fully support  this effort to extend the health care for the additional time. I think it is a good public policy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the chairman for amending this legislation to address my concern that, as originally drafted, the bill did not provide equity for those veterans whose eligibility period would have expired prior to the enactment of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At my request, the bill was amended to make sure that those veterans whose eligibility period had ended prior to the enactment and did not enroll in the VA health care would be eligible for an additional 3 years of VA health care services. All veterans who served in combat should receive the same level of care, and I appreciate the chairman for adopting and agreeing to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1993, Congress enacted Public Law 103-210 to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide additional authority for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide health care for veterans of the Persian Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The special health care authority allowed VA to treat those veterans who served in combat operations in the Persian Gulf for possible war-related illnesses, even though there was not definitive evidence that the disorders treated were related to wartime service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subsequent congressional hearings on Persian Gulf veterans health care highlighted the importance of early intervention in treating the kind of unexplained health problems experienced by many Persian Gulf war veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1998, with the potential of renewed combat in the Persian Gulf, Public Law 105-368, the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998, was enacted. This law authorizes the VA to provide medical care and other medical services to combat veterans for a period of 2 years following the service separation date for veterans who served on active duty in theater of combat operations during a period of war after the Persian Gulf War, or in combat against a hostile force during a period of hostilities after  November 11 of 1998. Members of the National Guard and Reserves may be eligible for this care if they meet certain requirements which essentially satisfy the definition of a "veteran."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The experience of the 1990s taught us the importance of both increasing understanding of war-related illnesses generally, and ensuring that the VA is better prepared to treat veterans of future wars and military combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also, at this moment, like to thank my colleague, Mr. Salazar of Colorado, who shared with me his statement that he gave honoring the life of a great American, Raymond Gerald Murphy. And I had an opportunity to read his statement that he read into the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record, and I appreciate him honoring such an American. My only regret is that I never had an opportunity to meet someone like this. And I'm sure that he touched the lives of many, many people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I suppose where we are, Mr. Speaker, is that with regard to how we recognize this Medal of Honor recipient by naming the hospital after him, the Veterans' Affairs Committee has specific criteria that we are to go by. And when you look at the specific criteria, we satisfy all the criteria. He's a Medal of Honor recipient. He has letters of support from all the veterans groups in the State of New Mexico, all of the recognized organizations, I have their letters here, Mr. Speaker, I'll be  more than happy to get them to you, along with the support of the Governor, all the Members of Congress, and we should be able to get this done. There's no reason why we shouldn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we have a situation whereby the committee has specific criteria for the naming of a VA hospital. This Medal of Honor recipient clearly applies. It passed the Senate. Yet we don't have criteria, as the chairman just spoke on the last bill, with regard to the naming of a cemetery. Yet we did it just for a political reason. And so now it's difficult for me to figure out how to follow the leadership of the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have criteria, but we take action on the floor. But where we do have criteria, we don't take action on the floor. So it is a puzzling moment that we have in how we are bringing these veterans bills to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for his helpful amendment to this bill. As I said earlier, this is a very important bill to thousands and thousands of returning veterans. They have basically unfettered access to one of the best health care systems in the world without going through a lot of red tape, without going through a lot of paperwork to prove that they are eligible. They will have 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is most important for our Reserve and Guard units, who are not eligible for the benefit structure of the VA system. They are not eligible for most of the benefits of the GI bill. And we are trying to make an effort to bring them in under the VA benefits under what we call "total force structure."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill is important to thousands of people, those that are coming back from the Marines or Army and those that are in the Guard and Reserve units. All of them now will have 5 years where these hidden injuries, brain injury, or post-traumatic stress disorder may become evident, and they may seek help. Now they will be able to do it without any of the bureaucratic entanglements. And I think this will have a remarkable impact on the lives of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will tell you, as George Washington said more than 200 years ago, "The morale of our fighting troops is dependent, most of all, on how they feel they're going to be treated when they come home." When they know they will have 5 years to come to the VA, they will know that a Nation is caring for them and is responsive to their needs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I often say that the opportunity to serve on Veterans' Affairs Committee is one of the greatest privileges I have been given in my short time in Congress. The action on the floor of the House today is another reminder of how it is truly an honor to serve on this Committee. Earlier this afternoon the House passed several pieces of legislation to improve outreach and care to our nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Memorial Day is the day for Americans to officially honor the heroes who have fallen in service to our country, and a day to pray for and remember the brave souls who have given the ultimate sacrifice. We are the beneficiaries of those who serve and who have served to preserve the peace and freedom we enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a nation, we honor the bravery of those who have fought and died for our country and recognize the tremendous sacrifices they and their families have made. But to truly honor these heroes it is our duty as a grateful nation to not just spend the day remembering their service, but to provide the promised support and benefits to the soldiers and veterans who served with and followed them. These bills help provide that support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act, creates a grant program to allow the VA to partner with State and county veteran organizations to reach out to veterans and their families to ensure they are aware of their eligibility for benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill also increases acountability in spending taxpayer dollars by requiring reports on how the grants in this program have been used to improve outreach. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and am pleased it has passed the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="612">H.R. 612</bill> is an extremely important piece of legislation. This bill will extend access to VA Healthcare for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans from two years to five years. This is vital to the health of our veterans returning from Iraq because of the nature of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some cases, TBI and PTSD symptoms do not emerge until several years after the injury occurred. With the current freeze on Category 8 veteran enrollment in VA healthcare, this means that some OIF/OEF will realize they suffered a brain injury while deployed but be locked out of the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They might not have health insurance to cover their treatment, and will not have crucial medical documents that will help them receive disability benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By expanding their eligibility for 3 additional years, Congress is acting to limit the damage done by the President's Category 8 veterans enrollment freeze. I was proud to also cosponsor this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another extremely important bill to our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is <bill type="h" number="2199">H.R. 2199</bill>, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long Term Support Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TBI is the signature injury of the war in Iraq and this bill vastly improves the VA's ability to provide care for brain injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires the VA to establish a program to screen veterans for TBI and establish a program of long term care for acute TBI victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, of the nearly 1,300 VA health care facilities in the United States, only 4 have specialized TBI programs. This bill allows the VA to partner with private facilities to provide treatment the VA cannot immediately provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also establishes centers of research and a national database so we can better understand the causes and symptoms of TBI. Hopefully, this will allow us to better treat victims in the future. This bill contains provisions of <bill type="h" number="1944">H.R. 1944</bill>, a bill I originally cosponsored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill> expands chiropractic care to all VA facilities throughout the country by 2011. During a subcommittee hearing on returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, several OIF veterans suggested that back injuries will be a long term problem for this generation of veterans. This bill will help the VA better prepare for this new wave of patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that these bills passed the House today and that I could support their passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has a responsibility to live up to our promises to our veterans. Today was another down payment on fulfilling these promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through my role on the Veterans Affairs Committee, I pledge to continue to push for legislation that will improve services for our veterans and treat them with the respect they have worked so hard to earn.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="612">H.R. 612</bill>, the Returning Servicemember VA Healthcare Insurance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill extends the eligibility period for receipt of VA hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for veterans who served in combat during--or after--the Persian Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the eligibility period for these VA services is two years. This bill lengthens that two year time frame to five years from a veteran's date of discharge or release from service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we learn more and more about what are increasingly being referred to as the signature wounds of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom--Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--I believe that this extension of VA care is essential to this Congress' mission to provide comprehensive care to our nation's heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often, a servicemember's battle scars run deeper than what is visible to an outsider. While many bodily injuries sustained are apparent to the naked eye, TBI, PTSD, and other conditions are not easily observed. Diagnosis of these conditions may require lengthy, detailed evaluations by specialists over the course of time. Furthermore, some psychological disorders take months or even years to develop following a servicemember's release from duty. Some chronic physical conditions also take time  to peak and subsequently diagnose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By extending eligibility to VA care to five years, we are helping to ensure that fewer physical and mental wounds go undiagnosed and untreated. We are helping to ensure that the care that veterans seek out and receive is more complete by enabling the VA to address more of servicemembers' health needs. Most importantly, we are offering another way to better care for our nation's wounded warriors who have sacrificed the best years of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="612">H.R. 612</bill> because it is an improvement upon the current system.</paragraph>
