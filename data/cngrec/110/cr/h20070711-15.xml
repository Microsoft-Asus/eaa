  <narrative>REDEPLOYMENT OF OUR TROOPS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7495]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, even for those convinced the surge in Iraq is a mistake, the manner in which we implement a decision to leave that country is critical to our Nation. Therefore, any Congress mandating a new security policy through force of law owes a careful explanation to the country why and how it is to be done, including dealing with what would occur in the aftermath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However much Americans may agree with us a desire to reduce U.S. forces and withdraw them from Iraq quickly, this Nation must face the alternative of what will happen in the region once that redeployment is done by a force of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must remember it took us approximately 6 months to withdraw a small number of troops just from Somalia. We have 160,000 troops in Iraq and over 100,000 contractors, but the time line of about a year that is needed for a safe redeployment also works well to protect our regional interests in a strategic approach to end this war. It provides the time needed for a strategy of regional accommodation to take effect with Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia,  a strategy  that rightly relies upon the long-term interests in a stable aftermath. Therefore, ending this war is necessary but insufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How we end it and by what means is even of greater importance for our troops' safety and our own security.</paragraph>
