  <speaking speaker="400290" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="356">H.R. 356</bill>) to remove certain restrictions on the Mammoth Community Water District's ability to use certain property acquired by that District from the United States.</paragraph>

  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="356">H.R. 356</bill> removes congressionally imposed restrictions on the use of lands transferred in 1987 from the United States to the Mammoth Community Water District in California. This legislation would allow the District to modify the use of these lands so that those 12 acres of land now used for material storage may be put to a more beneficial use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on similar legislation. In the 109th Congress, similar legislation was favorably reported by the committee and passed by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have no objections on this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="356">H.R. 356</bill>. <bill type="h" number="356">H.R. 356</bill>, introduced by our colleague from California, Buck McKeon, removes land use restrictions on property acquired from the Forest Service by the Mammoth Community Water District in Mono County, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1987, the U.S. Forest Service conveyed 25 acres to the Water District under land use conditions at the time. Of these lands, 12 acres are now needed for different uses, including much-needed water utility operations. Implementation of this noncontroversial bill will ultimately benefit the local water consumer and will adhere to all Federal, State, and local environmental laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong support for <bill type="h" number="356">HR 356</bill>, legislation I introduced earlier this year to remove restrictions on 25 acres of land patented to the Mammoth County Water District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to 1987, the District occupied this land through a special use permit with the Forest Service. Of these 25 acres, 12 acres were used for the storage of materials, and prior to 1987, for oxidation ponds, which had become obsolete by that year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After that time, Congress passed Public Law 97-465 that allowed these lands to be transferred directly to the District. While the law allowed for acquisition of these lands, it also directed that they could only be used for those purposes prior to the time of the conveyance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, however, these 12 acres are no longer needed for the storage of materials and the community would like to utilize this land in a more economically and socially viable manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such restrictions as those currently placed on the aforementioned acreage hinder the Mammoth community's ability to respond to the growing needs of its citizens and visitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As such, passage of this legislation would allow the town to accommodate for the growing economic and social needs of the region. In particular I am pleased to inform my colleagues of plans to use these acres for enhanced emergency services availability for the people of Mammoth Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to express my deep appreciation to Chairman Rahall for bringing this legislation to the floor and ask my colleagues to support its passage here today.</paragraph>
