    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor Army PFC Jonathan N. McCart Peterson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Peterson was born September 11, 1987, in Liberal, KS. He graduated from McCook High School in May 2005 and joined the Army on July 26 of that year. He attended basic training at Fort Jackson, SC, and was then stationed at Fort Lewis, WA. He later transferred to Rose Barracks Army Base near Vilseck, Germany, where he was an information systems operator and maintainer and worked specifically as a local area network manager.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday, May 25, 2007, Private First Class Peterson passed away at Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney as a result of an automobile accident. He was 19 years old. He is survived by his mother, Valery A. McCart, of Cambridge; two sisters, Jessica M. Peterson and her son, Nikolas Malleck, of McCook, and Jayme L. Peterson of Kearney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of PFC Jonathan Peterson during this time of heartbreak. Even in death, his selfless service to our country was evident. As an organ donor, he undoubtedly saved many lives. Few Americans ever achieve as much as Private First Class Peterson did in such a tragically short life. He will be forever remembered as a hero.</paragraph>
