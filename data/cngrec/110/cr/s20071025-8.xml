  <narrative>REMEMBERING SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE -- (Senate - October 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13392">S13392</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 5 years ago today, the Senate lost one of its hardest working, most respected Members: Senator Paul Wellstone. I can still remember very clearly the phone call I received from Pete Rouse, who was the chief of staff for Senator Daschle, and he said: I have some terrible news. There was an airplane crash, and we think Paul Wellstone was on that plane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, hope springs eternal, and I was hoping that was wrong, but it wasn't. He was in a plane crash. Sheila, who was his partner--she was with him everyplace--was killed in that plane crash. One of his three children, Marcia, was also killed, and three campaign aides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Typical for Paul Wellstone, he had made a commitment to be someplace, and he wanted to go. The weather was bad. The pilot said everything would be OK. The pilot wasn't telling him the way it really was. I am not going to get into how the accident happened or why it happened, but certainly it was nothing that Paul Wellstone did wrong. Paul Wellstone wanted to fulfill a commitment. He shouldn't have been up in that airplane. The pilot shouldn't have taken that airplane into the areas that he did,  but he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his life, Paul Wellstone earned the titles of doctor, professor, Senator, but he liked to be called Paul. That is what I am going to call him today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul loved to talk. He stood back there, and he was a good speaker. I can remember the first time I heard him speak. There were some new Senators who had been elected, and we had an event in the Rotunda for the new Senators. I had never heard him speak before. He was dynamic, what he said. He was talking about why he had gotten involved in politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul came here in 1991. He was a crusader. That is what he was. He was a crusader. He was always out charging ahead on some issue he believed in. Mostly, the issues were those where people needed help. The poor, the left behind, veterans, the environment, and those with mental illness were always a special concern to him. He took pride in championing the fight for people needing a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He knew a lot about growing up with adversity. He had a brother he loved who suffered from mental illness, and that is why he joined with Senator Domenici to work on mental health parity. His parents worked hard. They didn't have much. But Paul told me how his father would sit at the table in the evening and talk to him about what was important in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a remarkable man. He was very small in stature physically, but in that big facility across Constitution Avenue, the police headquarters, where hundreds and hundreds of police officers come and go out of that facility every day over the years, Paul Wellstone still holds the record of being able to do the most chin-ups and the most pushups in a given period of time. He was a powerful little man physically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of what he accomplished, as indicated with the chin-ups and pushups, was with sheer grit and determination. He earned a wrestling scholarship from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He married his high school sweetheart. He earned an Atlantic Coast Wrestling Championship and managed to graduate in just 3 years. After college, he earned a Ph.D. in political science and became a college professor at the age of 24 at a very academically known school, Carleton College in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even then, in his years before the Senate, he was a true believer and an impassioned fighter for justice, and that is an understatement. One may not have agreed with what his definition of justice was, but his definition was worth fighting for, and he fought hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While teaching at Carleton College, he led the charge to divest the university from apartheid in South Africa. He helped local farmers when banks came to foreclose on their farms. That is Paul Wellstone. He fostered a new generation of active, civic-minded students by teaching specialized courses with names like "Social Movements" and "Grassroots Organizing." These were courses he invented. There were no textbooks for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were some who said that for an untenured professor, teaching activism and leading campus protests wasn't the smartest career move a person could make. In fact, when Paul came up for tenure, he was initially denied. In effect, he was in the process of being fired. It took a groundswell of student support. Thousands and thousands of students, most of whom didn't even go to that university, rallied on his behalf. He kept his job. He got tenure. At 28, he was the youngest tenured professor  in the history of Carleton College. It was done because the students wanted him more than did the administration, because he was a great teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when he came to the Senate, it was no surprise he brought a fearless progressive spirit with him. I recall observers comparing him to Jimmy Smith's character in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." He was idealistic, he was determined, and he was very effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came here refusing to be phased by the politics of division, refusing to be phased by business as usual. I don't think the phrase "status quo" was in his vocabulary. Wherever he saw injustice, intolerance, or simply ineffectiveness, one would understand that Paul Wellstone would be around. When he found injustice in the treatment of the mentally ill, he stepped forward to ensure parity for sufferers of what were known as unspoken illnesses when it comes to insurance caps. When he found injustice  in the treatment of our veterans, he stepped forward to help them, especially those who were homeless. When he found injustice in the way our Earth was treated, he stepped forward to protect the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge from drilling, among other things. He never hesitated, paused, or pondered. He stepped forward. He was really a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in his leading, that didn't mean everybody agreed with him because much of the time--in fact, most of the time--he was in the minority. He didn't care if he had two people supporting him or one or if he was alone. He never hesitated--I repeat, he never paused or pondered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many wondered how this fire-breathing progressive was able to accomplish so much in his time. The answer is that he believed in bipartisanship and he actively embraced it. It was never a surprise to see Paul team up with one or more of the Senate's most conservative Members to get something done for the people of the State of Minnesota or our country. During his time here in Washington, it never changed him. It really didn't. He left this Earth with the same idealisms and passion he always had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He once said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never separate the life you live from the words you speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He lived by that rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall that when he first arrived in the Senate, he kept wondering--he would leave his office all messed up, and he would come back and it was clean. He asked: Who does that? He was told: People come in late at night and clean your office--the janitors. So Paul Wellstone, after learning that, stayed that night. They came after midnight. He waited for them so he could tell them how much he appreciated them cleaning his office. That is the kind of guy he was. True to form, he did that, as he  did many unusual things, in the minds of many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a man who still works here; his name is Gary. I don't know Gary's last name. He is a big man. He helps us here. We have all seen him. Gary said people refer to him as "Tiny." Paul told me: I would appreciate it if you wouldn't refer to him as "Tiny." His name is Gary. I have never referred to him as anything other than Gary. He thought that was a pejorative statement. Tiny, as many people refer to him, is a huge man, and Paul somehow thought that was not the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was really my friend. I counseled with him. I went to the doctor with him. Right before he was killed, he had  a terribly bad back. Oh, it was bad. He refused to go to the doctor. He refused to go to the hospital, which is where he should have gone. We took him to the doctor down here. The sweat, because of the pain, was pouring off his face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a very tough man. I will always remember that phone call I got from Pete Rouse. I will always remember Paul Wellstone. The loss of his presence has been felt and missed every day. He added a new dimension to the Senate. You don't always have to win to be a winner. So I say to his sons, David and Mark, and the entire Wellstone family, Paul Wellstone will always be in my heart and in the hearts of anyone who knew him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I, too, today wish to comment on the remarkable life of Paul Wellstone. Elaine and I got to knew Paul for two reasons. No. 1, they lived right near us on Capitol Hill and we would frequently see them coming and going. No. 2, Sheila was from eastern Kentucky, and we had an opportunity to share observations about those good people in eastern Kentucky from whom she sprang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is indeed a sad anniversary. I join the Senate family in honoring the memory of Senator Paul Wellstone and celebrating his distinguished Senate career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the most unlikely Senator. His election in 1990 was widely considered kind of a fluke, an accident. But he was neither. He was the genuine article, an extraordinary man who came to work every day with enthusiasm. He had a very upbeat outlook on life. Sometimes people who are either on the very left or the very right have a kind of grim view of things. Paul would, by his own admission, say he was on the very far left of things, but he didn't have a grim nature about him at all. He was upbeat  and optimistic, and he came to work every day ready to fight for what he believed in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul was a champion of mental health and other causes. With Paul, you never had any uncertainty about where he stood. It was absolutely clear. I am having a hard time recalling a single matter upon which he and I agreed, but Paul was what I would call a conviction-based politician, a public servant who never wavered from his beliefs, even when the political winds shifted against him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He and Sheila--that eastern Kentuckian I talked about--were absolutely inseparable. High school sweethearts, they had been married for 39 years when, regretfully, the plane carrying them, their daughter Marcia, three staff members, and two pilots went down in Eveleth, MN, on the way to a debate in Duluth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The entire Nation grieved that day for this former wrestling champ, an unlikely and, as I indicated, unforgettable Senator. We grieve on this anniversary with Paul's two surviving sons, David and Mark, and the many former Wellstone staffers, the Wellstone people who worked so hard to carry on his legacy. As the majority leader indicated, he had a distinguished academic career, earned his bachelor's degree in 1965 and his doctorate 3 years later. He plowed right through college at the University  of North Carolina, both his undergraduate degree and his doctorate. He was a Phi Beta Kappa. That is about as good as it gets for a student at college. He actually attended on a wrestling scholarship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul was not very tall. He was 5 feet 5 inches or 5 feet 6 inches but a strong guy. He was a champion Atlantic Coast Conference wrestler. He was named to the all-ACC wrestling team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the majority leader outlined, Paul was a great professor, widely loved and admired by his students, and I think it is safe to say he was widely admired and loved by his colleagues in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will always remember Paul Wellstone.</paragraph>
