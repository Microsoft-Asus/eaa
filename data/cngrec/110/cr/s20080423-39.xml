  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about <bill type="s" number="2324">S. 2324</bill>, the Inspector General Reform Act, which is expected to pass the Senate today with an amendment of mine. The amendment makes several reforms and clarifying changes to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 3 of the bill requires the President to give Congress 30 days' notice before removing or transferring an inspector general from his position. My amendment clarifies that the President may still take other actions against an inspector general without providing 30 days' notice, such as suspending him or otherwise preventing him from taking official actions. While section 3 appears to be designed to allow Congress to respond to a situation where an inspector general is fired in order to  impede his discovery of wrongdoing or for other improper reasons, my amendment is intended to address another kind of scenario, one where an inspector general is fired for very good reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not assume that inspectors general will be immune to human failings. If an inspector general is fired because he has been indicted or is under investigation for corruption or has otherwise abused the powers of his office, it should be clear that the President can prevent the inspector general from launching new investigations in retaliation or taking other official actions, and that he can be denied access to his office space. My amendment ensures that this is so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 6 of the bill authorizes inspectors general to obtain legal advice from the attorneys working for them. While this provision strengthens the independence of inspectors general, it creates a potential ambiguity as to who has ultimate authority to resolve legal questions within an agency. Agency employees should not face a division of authority if an inspector general were to reach a different conclusion on a legal matter previously resolved by the agency counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment clarifies that the agency or department's chief legal officer remains the ultimate legal authority within the agency. While an inspector general may obtain his own legal advice, his review does not constitute an appeal or review of the general counsel's decisions and judgments. The chief legal officer's views are what is final within the agency, and they are subject to review within the executive branch only by the head of the agency and the Justice Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 8 of the bill as reported by the committee allowed inspectors general to include their own budget comments with respect to their offices in the President's budget proposal to Congress. I would first note that the generous growth of inspectors generals' budgets during this administration leaves little  reason to fear that these offices are being starved of resources. More fundamentally, as a general matter, all agencies and departments should be subject to the Office of Management and Budget's budgeting process, to ensure that the President's budget proposal reflects and balances competing priorities. Rules such as that in section 8 should generally be disfavored. An exception is tolerable here only because of the unique status and role of the inspectors general. And even in their case, we  should not assume that every disagreement between the Office of Management and Budget and an inspector general about the size of his budget reflects some effort to suppress an investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All bureaucrats love to see their budgets grow and to build their little empires. We should not assume that inspectors general are immune from this tendency. To mitigate its effects, my amendment would require that an inspector general assert that he would be inhibited in the performance of his duties before he may submit a separate budget request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment serves two purposes. First, it should rein in requests for ever-expanding budgets, and ensure that inspectors general generally remain subject to budget discipline. And secondly, it ensures that if an administration is retaliating against an inspector general or otherwise reducing his budget in order to prevent him from doing his job, then Congress will be alerted to the fact. If separate budget requests were routine, the submission of such requests would provide little notice to  congressional overseers. And if an inspector general believes that an administration is starving him of resources with the intent to undermine his ability to do his job, Congress not only should have before it his separate budget request, it should also be made aware that the inspector general believes that he is being treated that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, section 14 of the committee-reported bill would have given the Justice Department's inspector general the authority to conduct legal ethics reviews. I found this provision strongly objectionable. An attorney's decision to investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice is a sensitive one and should be reviewed with great deference. There can be a wide range of legitimate disagreement as to how such issues should be decided. Justice Department reviews of such decisions are equivalent to  the attorney discipline proceedings conducted by state bar associations. They are currently conducted within the Justice Department by the Office of Professional Responsibility, and there is no evidence that this Office's reviews are anything less than adequate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, recently the Office of Professional Responsibility has taken upon itself the role of reviewing the merits of the Office of Legal Counsel's legal analyses. The Office of Legal Counsel's lawyers are recognized to be among the very best in the executive branch. They are assigned to resolve the most difficult legal questions that confront an administration. I find it dubious that an OPR lawyer would be in any position to assess whether an Office of Legal Counsel opinion is legally correct  or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Absent at least some evidence that such an opinion was the product of bribery or other improper external influences, I question the basis on which  OPR even assumes for itself the authority to initiate such a review. I fear that OPR's actions are influenced more by the toxic style of opposition attacks on the Justice Department in recent years, in which legitimate policy and legal disputes are recast as ethical lapses, rather than by a sound concern for  the integrity of the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some of the Office of Professional Responsibilities' recent actions are debatable, the notion of extending that Office's authority to the inspector general is totally unacceptable. Inspectors general investigate waste, fraud, and abuse. They are suited neither by temperament nor experience to second guess whether a Justice Department lawyer should have investigated a matter, prosecuted a case, or offered a legal opinion. It is at my insistence that the original section 14 has been removed  from this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their devotion to overseeing and improving the operations of the inspectors general and, with the changes made by my amendment, I will raise no objection to the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
