  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) for 11 minutes?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight for what time is left to us to talk a little bit about health care. I do try to do that every week because this is such an important issue that faces our country, and over the next 18 to 24 months we are going to see perhaps some significant changes proposed and some, in fact, enacted in the Nation's health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to draw your attention, today there was an excellent piece written in today's Wall Street Journal. This piece was on the editorial page, it was written by Dr. Robert A. Swerlick. It is entitled, "Our Soviet Health System."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dr. Swerlick does such a good job of encapsulating a lot of the issues that I have been talking about here over the past several weeks and I just wanted to share a couple of quotes with you from his article as we get started. He is talking about the imbalance between supply and demand. He became aware of it when he found no trouble finding a veterinarian for his pet, but found difficulty finding a pediatric endocrinologist for a diabetic child. And the reason for the imbalance, Mr.  Speaker, according to Dr. Swerlick, is because of some of the distortions of the marketplace and the inaccurate signals delivered to the marketplace because of our manipulation of those signals and of those market forces with the pricing structure we have in our Medicare system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am quoting from the article from today, and it says, "The roots of the problem lie in the use of the administrative pricing structures in medicine. The way prices are set in health care already distorts the appropriate allocation of efforts and resources in health care. Unfortunately, many of the suggested reforms of our health care system, including the various plans for universal care or universal insurance or a single payer's system that various policy makers espouse, rest on the same unsound  foundations and will produce more of the same." Going on and continuing to quote, "The essential problem is this; the pricing of medical care in this country is either directly or indirectly dictated by Medicare. And Medicare uses an administrative formula which calculates appropriate prices based upon imperfect estimates and fudge factors rather than independently calculate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then further on into the article, again quoting, "Unlike prices set on the market, errors in this system are not self-correcting." That is, we make a mistake in our policy meetings, in our committee hearings, we make a mistake in setting the actual value to a medical service, and that mistake never gets corrected by market forces. It is insulated, it is anesthetized from market forces, and the consequence is it gets worse over time. And then we compound the error when we try to fix things at  the committee level or at the level of the Federal agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One last thing that I would like to point out that the article does state so succinctly. Markets may not get all the prices exactly correct all of the time, but they are capable of self-correction, a capacity that has yet to be demonstrated by administrative pricing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, a very worthwhile article. And I commend it, Mr. Speaker, to you. And perhaps some of our colleagues will also be interested in that article as well because I think it very succinctly sums up a lot of the things that I have been pointing out over the past several weeks here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the few remaining minutes that I have left, I wanted to talk just a little bit about the physician workforce of the future, because that is something we have to focus on as we have this health care debate. A lot of times I worry we are getting the cart before the horse. Here is a cover of the Texas Medical Association's professional magazine back in my home State of Texas. Texas Medicine last March devoted a lot of the issue to the concept of running out of doctors. As a consequence,  I am introducing three physician workforce bills tomorrow that will deal with the person perhaps thinking about a career in medicine, the young physician just starting out in either medical school or residency, and then finally, a third bill to deal with the iniquities in the Medicare pricing system that I just referenced in the article of today's Wall Street Journal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The physician workforce crisis has to be approached on several fronts. The issue of medical liability is one that we need to take on, and we need to be quite serious about that. But when we look at perhaps the largest group of doctors that we may not have in the very near future because of the things we are doing in our Medicare pricing schedule, these are the areas where we really need to concentrate. Baby boomers are going to retire, they are going to get older. Demand for services are going  to go nowhere but up. If the physician workforce continues its downward trend, as it is doing year over year, we may not be talking any longer about funding a Medicare program, we may be talking about why there is no one there to take care of seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Year after year reduction in reimbursement plans from the Center of Medicaid and Medicare Services to physicians for services they provide for  their Medicare patients. This is wrong. It is not a question of doctors wanting to make more money, it's about a stabilized repayment for services already rendered. And it isn't affecting just doctors, it is affecting patients every day. It becomes a real crisis of access. Not a week goes by that I don't get a  letter or a fax from some physician who says, you know what? I've just had enough and I am going to retire early, or I am no longer going to see Medicare patients in my practice, or I am going to restrict the procedures that I offer to Medicare patients. Unfortunately, I know this is happening because I saw it in the hospital environment before I left practice to come to Congress a few years</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare payments to physicians are modified annually using a formula called the Sustainable Growth Rate. I won't bare you with the intricacies of that formula tonight, I may do that at some other time. But because of flaws in the process, physicians get a mandated fee cut every year, year over year for several years to come. If no long-term congressional action is implemented, the SGR will continue to mandate fee cuts. Unlike hospital reimbursement rates, unlike reimbursement rates to HMOs or  drug companies, those closely follow the cost of living index, but the physician's formula does not. In fact, Medicare payments to physicians cover only about 65 percent of the actual cost of providing the services. Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, any industry or company</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is repeal of the SGR is very costly. The Congressional Budget Office currently scores that at about $280 billion. There are ways to approach this. There are short term and long-term ways. And we need to have the political courage, we need to have the political will to do the things necessary to ensure that we do repeal the SGR and the formula and pay doctors on a more rational Medicare economic index such as hospitals are paid that recognizes the increase and cost of delivering care.  All of this information is technicomplex and it is even boring to listen to, but it is an incredibly important story for our country. It is a story of how the most advanced, most innovative and most appreciated health care system in the world needs a little help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The end of this story should read "happily ever after," but I am not sure we can reach that conclusion given where we are today. The last chapter should read "a privatized industry leads to a healthy ending."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I stated in the beginning, before I began this talk, we are in a debate that will forever change our health care system. We must understand what is working in our system and what is not. We cannot delay making changes and bringing health care into the 21st century. The only way that we can have this to work is to allow the private sector to lay the foundation for improvements. The pillars of this health care system we have must be rooted in the bedrock of a thriving public sector and not the  shaky ground of a public system that has proven costly and inefficient in other countries and in fact in our own back yard. Again, I reference the article from today where the errors are self-perpetuating in the system and market forces are never allowed to correct those errors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must devote our work in Congress to building a stronger private sector in health care. History has proven this to be the tried and true method. We can bring down the number of insured, we can increase patient access, and we can stabilize the physician workforce, modernize our technology, and bring transparency to the system. All of these things are within our grasp if we have the foresight, the determination, the courage and the political will to get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your indulgence. The day is concluded, and I will yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
