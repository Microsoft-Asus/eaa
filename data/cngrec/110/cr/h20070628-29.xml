  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this past Monday on the 57th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and I introduced legislation to rightfully honor Korean War veterans with a national charter. The charter pays no money but gives veterans leverage when dealing with the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is about time those who served in the Korean War enjoy the same mark of distinction and national recognition as those who came home from World War II. Some have dubbed the Korean War the "forgotten war" or even "the war that America forgot to remember."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I was in that war, and so were at least two of our colleagues, Charlie Rangel and John Conyers, and I think that it is kind of ridiculous that we haven't given them the recognition they deserve. I flew over 62 combat missions in Korea, and I can't think of a better way to honor our patriots who served in Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to cosponsor our bill, <bill type="h" number="2852">H.R. 2852</bill>, to give the Korean War Veterans Association a national charter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
