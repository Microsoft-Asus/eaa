  <narrative>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO SENATOR BYRD -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14599">S14599</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, might I be recognized for a moment to comment, as the Senator from West Virginia did, on the birthday of Senator Byrd?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be very brief. Certainly, Senator Rockefeller, being Senator Byrd's colleague, with great emotion, I noted, commented on his colleague's birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope perhaps coming from someone on the other side of the aisle it will be equally meaningful to recognize Senator Byrd's birthday, but also recognizing his long service here, not just his birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all hope we can continue to achieve those birthdays, but more important is the ability to represent the people of our State, the people of the United States, and do so over a long and distinguished career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few who have matched Senator Byrd in that regard. I join Senator Rockefeller in extending my best wishes to Senator Byrd, someone who, like me, loves bluegrass music. The only difference is he can play it; I cannot. Happy birthday, Senator.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join in wishing Senator Byrd a happy 90th birthday. I first heard Senator Byrd speak, and for that matter play his fiddle, in 1974 in Shelby, OH, a city in north central Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a candidate, right out of school, for the State legislature. I knew of Senator Byrd's reputation, but I never heard him play the fiddle, and I was honored by his coming to this small town and playing the fiddle for the assembled 200 or 300 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also had the pleasure of listening to Senator Byrd earlier this year as a freshman member of this body as he spoke to the Democratic caucus lunch. He talked about his background. He was born during the flu epidemic. It took members of his and so many families' lives, and his struggles, as Senator Rockefeller said, made him into the scholar and the fighter for economic justice that he has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I had the pleasure of visiting Senator Byrd in his office my first month on the job. He then came out during my maiden speech on the Senate floor and made a comment that my daughter talks about to this day. He said: Senator Brown's words will be in the Congressional Record not for 100 years but 1,000 years. And my daughter called me up right afterward and said Senator Byrd said the words will be in the Congressional Record in 1,000 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more important than that, he gave me his collection of speeches on the history of the Roman Senate, something we all, as newer Members of the body, should have the opportunity, and should take advantage of the opportunity to learn from his writings about the Roman Senate, how we can make this Senate work better than sometimes it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would finally say, as the Senator from the State on the other side of the Ohio River, we share Parkersburg and Marietta and Belpre. We share Wheeling and Belmont County, Saint Clairsville, Bellaire, Flushing, across the river, and all up and down the river. People on my side of the river have such great admiration--of course,  they do in West Virginia, but they have such great admiration on my side of the river for the terrific work Senator Byrd  has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I only have 4 or 5 minutes I would like to say about Thanksgiving and the farm bill. But if Senator Byrd would like to take time before that, I am certainly willing to yield or I can proceed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have some comments. They will be short, but I will save them for next Tuesday, which the Lord willing, at that time I will say a few things. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator. I thank all of the Senators. I thank all the Members and the staff who make it possible for us to do our work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good Thanksgiving.</paragraph>
