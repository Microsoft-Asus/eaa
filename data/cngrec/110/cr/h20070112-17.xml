    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my mother was an extraordinary woman. There is no doubt that Medicare helped her live the last of her 94 years with dignity and mostly independence. However, despite having one son as a doctor, one as a pharmaceutical executive and one as a Member of Congress, our family still struggled to meet her needs. As a Member of this body, I felt helpless and almost ashamed to know that there are millions more like her forced to decide between food and medicine each month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud now to be a part of this inspired and honest effort to make a difference in the lives America's elderly and disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although mother is gone now, I can still make a difference for her sister, my 91-year-old Aunt Mary. She fell into the part D doughnut hole and paid thousands of dollars a month for her medications. It is an outrage that my aunt and millions of Americans are paying record prices while drug companies are reporting record profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Giving Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices is a monumental first step. I hope it is just the beginning of expanding every American's access to quality and affordable health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you all to think of your mothers and aunts when you cast your vote for <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>. Do this for every one of your constituents who has to decide between meals and medicine and show America that we are all dedicated to a new direction.</paragraph>
