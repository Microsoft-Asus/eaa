    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I very proudly stand here today to recommend the Reverend Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, a minister in the Fifth Congressional District, which I very proudly serve, be given the honor of having a postal facility named in his honor at 4320 Blue Parkway in Kansas City, Missouri. All nine members of the Missouri delegation have signed on to this bill, and they signed on for one real reason. It is this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rev. Hartsfield is an American story. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 12 in 1929. He was raised by his mother. He was the only child and yet she worked and struggled and pushed him. He eventually graduated from high school and then served a 3-year tour of duty with the United States Army. He returned to this country and attended Clark College, which is now called Clark Atlanta University. He received a bachelor's degree, and then he went on to receive a Master's of Divinity at Gammon  Theological Seminary, which is known as the Interdenominational Theological Seminary today. He's received a number of honorary doctorate degrees, and he is recognized in our community as a man who is always going to be where something good is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been a strong worker in the field of diversity. He is a man who has been able to bring the clergy together from across racial and even religious lines. He's known as the dean of preachers in our community, and I dubbed him the "Godfather of Preachers" because of the respect he receives from members of the clergy. Anytime anything in our community is going on that is productive and meaningful, you can expect to see Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This postal designation is the first I've ever introduced, and one of the reasons that I feel strongly about this is the post office delivers mail to everyone, and if you look at the life and work of the Reverend Wallace S. Hartsfield, that is exactly what he's done. He has delivered ministry, friendship and civic concern to everyone in our community, and so a post office, I think, is very, very appropriate to bear his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Madam Speaker, it would be my hope that this body would allow our community to celebrate fully his retirement at a November 9 banquet, during which time I would like to proudly announce that the United States Congress has named a post office in his honor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to pay tribute to Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield, a family man, community activist, and man of God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rev. Hartsfield was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 12, 1929. After a 3-year tour of duty with the United States Army, he went on to receive a bachelor of arts degree from Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University. Three years later, in 1957, he received a Master of Divinity degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list of honorary degrees Rev. Hartsfield has earned is long and distinguished. They include a Doctor of Divinity from both Western Baptist Bible College in Kansas City, Missouri, and Virginia Seminary and College of Lyncher, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While his list of academic accomplishments is impressive, the work he has done since the end of his formal education is even more so. His first pastorate was in Pickens, South Carolina, and he served in the States of Kansas, Florida, and Georgia before settling into a position at the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church located in Kansas City, Missouri, a place he has preached for over 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rev. Hartsfield will retire on January 1, 2008, as senior pastor. During his long service to the church, he became affectionately known as the dean of Kansas City Ministers; and the cosponsor of this bill, Mr. Cleaver, has nicknamed him the Godfather of Preachers because of the knowledge he possesses and his impressive oratory skills. He has become a mentor not only for those in the local ministry, but for community leaders as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His steadfast dedication to Kansas City and the surrounding area have helped solidify the community and shape it into what it is today. However, his leadership and influence have extended well beyond the boundaries of his duty as a minister. He has fought to promote, protect, and ensure civil liberties for all races, not only at home but across the Nation. And he served as president of the greater Kansas City chapter of Operation PUSH, an organization dedicated to the promotion of religious and  social development and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a former chairman of the Congress of National Black Churches that represents over 65,000 churches. He has also served in many positions within the National Baptist Convention of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reverend was appointed by the Governor to serve as commissioner on the Missouri Highway Commission and was at the forefront of efforts to construct the Metropolitan Homes, a 60-unit low-income housing development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all of his work and the demands for his time and attention, they did not detract from his love for his family. The reverend just celebrated his 50th anniversary with his wife, Matilda Hopkins. They are the proud parents of four children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me, Mr. Cleaver, and all of the members of the Missouri delegation in congratulating Rev. Hartsfield on his retirement, wish him well in his new endeavors, and join us in supporting the naming of the post office facility on Blue Parkway in Kansas City in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3572">H.R. 3572</bill>, which names a postal facility in Kansas City, Missouri, after Wallace S. Hartsfield, Sr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3572">H.R. 3572</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Emanuel Cleaver on September 18, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 4, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Missouri congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Rev. Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, Sr.'s dedication and service to the people of Kansas City goes back many years. He is a committed community activist, civil servant, and has served as the senior pastor of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church since 1972. He is the vice president-at-large of the Economic Development Commission of the National Baptist Convention of America, Incorporated. He is a former chairman of the Congress of National Black Churches and past president of  the General Baptist State Convention of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska. He has served as an adjunct professor and guest lecturer at numerous colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rev. Hartsfield is a well-respected man of faith, and on January 1, 2008, he will retire as senior pastor of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, the Reverend Representative Emanuel Cleaver, for introducing this legislation. I enthusiastically support this legislation and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
