  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 30 years ago, Congress established CAFE standards to lower our dependence on foreign oil. And the cost? Hundreds of billions of dollars to comply with the regulation, hundreds of thousands of auto jobs lost, and dependence on foreign oil has gone up over 100 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CAFE has not worked. It's an antiquated model, and we should be pursuing new technologies instead. But Democratic leaders are pushing even more stringent CAFE. Democrats are telling auto companies to produce more hybrids and other unprofitable vehicles to comply with new regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent JD Power survey shows consumer demand is dropping for hybrids, forcing costly incentives to move these expensive vehicles. Even Honda is discontinuing its Accord hybrid because of poor sales.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we worked with the domestic auto industry to develop leap-ahead technologies and make them affordable for all consumers instead of overregulating, we could achieve breakthroughs to reach our goals and to protect American jobs, but instead, the Democratic leadership has made a conscious decision to bankrupt Michigan.</paragraph>
