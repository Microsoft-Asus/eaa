  <narrative>125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FREDERICK NEWS-POST</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor and congratulate the Frederick News-Post on its 125th anniversary. On October 15, 1883, a printing company in Frederick, MD, published the first edition of The News, an evening newspaper that reported about local happenings. In 1916, this printing company purchased another local paper, the Frederick Post, which it continued to offer in the mornings. After almost a century of circulating these two editions, the company chose to merge the two  papers in 2002 and offer just a morning paper that included not only great local news stories but also important national coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Frederick News-Post circulates over 11 million papers a year and employs over 200 people. The company also includes FNP Printing &amp; Publishing, a commercial printing venture as well as an Internet division called FNP Interactive. The Frederick News-Post is a vital part of the Frederick community, and I am so proud that this Maryland newspaper has been successful for the past 125 years. I hope that it continues to bring the news to families around the State for 125 more.</paragraph>
