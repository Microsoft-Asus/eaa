  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="TRIBUTE TO JUDGE RICHARD SHEPPARD ARNOLD">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this morning in Little Rock, AR, at 10 a.m. local time, the new annex to the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Courthouse will be dedicated. In honor of that event, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the life of Judge Arnold and the contributions he made to Arkansas and this nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Richard Arnold served his Nation with honor and distinction in the Federal judiciary for a little over 25 years. Considered by some to be the greatest jurist of his time not to serve on the Supreme Court, Judge Arnold was respected for his reasoned, straightforward decisions that he rendered from the bench without any ideological bias. In short, he was a brilliant, fair, effective judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His colleagues in the legal community recognized his brilliance. In 1999, Judge Arnold was awarded the highly prestigious Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award. This honor is presented to a Federal judge who has achieved an exemplary career and has made significant contributions to the administration of justice, the advancement of the rule of law, and the improvement of society as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Arnold also received the prestigious Meador-Rosenberg Award from the American Bar Association for his work and dialogue with members of Congress about the problems facing the Federal courts during his service as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The award, which has only been presented five times since its inception in 1994, was presented through the ABA's Standing Committee of Federal Judicial Improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Texarkana, TX, in 1936, Judge Arnold and his younger brother, U.S. District Court Judge Morris "Buzz" Arnold, had many role models in their early life that were active in the legal community. Their father, Richard Lewis Arnold, was a public utilities law specialist, and their paternal grandfather, William H. Arnold, Sr., was a circuit judge and former Arkansas Bar Association President. In addition, their maternal grandfather was U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Arnold received a Classical Diploma from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1953. He graduated from Yale with a B.A., summa cum laude, in 1957. Afterwards, Judge Arnold attended the Harvard Law School where he received the Sears Prize for achieving the best grades in the first-year class and the Fay Diploma for being first academically in his graduating class. Judge Arnold concluded his formal education upon receiving his LL.B. from Harvard magna cum laude in 1960.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After law school, Judge Arnold served as a law clerk to Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. Arnold then practiced law in Washington, D.C., and Texarkana, Arkansas. After serving the Honorable Dale Bumpers while Bumpers was Governor of Arkansas and a United States Senator, Judge Arnold was appointed to the federal judiciary by President Jimmy Carter in 1978. He served on the District Bench for the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas and was elevated to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in  1980. He was Chief Judge for the Circuit from 1992-1998 and achieved senior status in April 2001 after he turned 65.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Congress renamed the U.S. District Courthouse for Eastern Arkansas the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Courthouse. Judge Arnold continued to live a full life until he succumbed to complications while being treated for lymphoma in 2004. His passing has left a void, but his legacy continues to live on at the courthouse that bears his name in Little Rock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent addition of the annex will bring 21st Century changes to the Richard S. Arnold Courthouse originally built in 1932. A beautiful glass atrium will connect the original structure to the new wing. The annex will house 12 judges' chambers, courtrooms, and a parking garage. In addition, the exterior will feature a fountain and water sculpture, as well as a beautiful plaza. The design that is dedicated today will ensure that Judge Arnold will be remembered and his name will continue to live  on for generations to come.</paragraph>
