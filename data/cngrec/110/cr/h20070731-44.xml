  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of the House, if there is one message that was abundantly clear based on the results of last year's election results, it was that the American people want us to end the culture of corruption that has enveloped the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, Americans have seen business as usual where time and time again special interests trump the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So we've heard that message loud and clear. For the past several months, the House and the Senate have diligently worked together to fuse a legislative response that combines the best of the measures passed by both Houses earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure that we consider today will go a long way toward bringing back accountability to the Congress and to restoring the trust of the American people in their government. <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> accomplishes these critical goals in four ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> puts an end to the K Street Project, an insidious effort that employed threats and intimidation to control the legislative process. <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> ensures that such efforts will no longer be permitted. It specifically prohibits Members and senior staff from influencing hiring decisions or practices of private entities for partisan political gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> shines a disinfecting spotlight on lobbying activities by mandating full and enhanced public disclosure on these activities. Pursuant to this measure, lobbyists will have to file reports on their lobbying activities twice as often each year. They will be required to disclose their contacts with Congress. They must certify that they did not give a gift or pay for travel in violation of the rules and, for the first time, file these reports electronically in a public, searchable database  so that anyone can review them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> closes loopholes in the current law that have been exploited to avoid the clear intent of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. It does this by mandating the disclosure of contributions in excess of $5,000 by businesses or organizations that actively lobby through certain coalitions and associations. And, it also requires the disclosure of the past executive and congressional employment of registered lobbyists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> prohibits a Member's spouse who becomes a lobbyist after the Member's election from making direct lobbying contacts to the Member or the Member's office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill addresses the process by which political contributions are bundled by campaign committees. It requires each committee to disclose to the Federal Election Commission, on a semiannual basis, specified information for each currently registered lobbyist who has either forwarded or been credited for raising contributions totaling at least $15,000 during the reporting period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> puts real teeth into enforcement. It increases the penalties for violations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act to deter and punish corrupt activity. It substantially increases civil penalties from the current level of $50,000, to four times as much, to $200,000 and provides for the imposition of criminal penalties of up to 5 years for knowing and corrupt violations of the Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are some of the major reforms that <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> offers. This bill recognizes the importance of lobbying to responsive and effective congressional and executive decision-making. And these reforms will help strengthen the sound foundation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act and go a long way toward restoring the trust of the American people in our system of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to respectfully point out the contributions from the other side, particularly the ranking member of Judiciary, Lamar Smith, in this endeavor, and so I urge my colleagues all to join me in supporting the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all deplore unethical conduct by Members of Congress and their staff. Each party has their fair share of examples. The public wants and deserves honest government. Unfortunately, this legislation does not bode well for this Congress' ability to deliver it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May, this House brought up a base bill that seemed very familiar to Republicans because the increased disclosures required in the bill were largely those contained in <bill type="h" number="4975">H.R. 4975</bill>, which was introduced by Congressman David Dreier, and which passed the House in the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year's <bill type="h" number="4975">H.R. 4975</bill> contained all of the following provisions: a requirement for Members to disclose post-employment negotiations with private entities; a prohibition on partisan influences on an outside entity's employment decisions; and increased quarterly electronic filing in a public database of lobbyist campaign contributions linked to Federal Election Commission filings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That Republican legislation also increased civil and criminal penalties for failures to comply; required disclosure by lobbyists of all past executive branch and congressional employment; and contained a prohibition on lobbyists' violation of House gift ban rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation the Democrats introduced this Congress, in the form of <bill type="h" number="2316">H.R. 2316</bill>, largely replicated Republican efforts from the previous Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Judiciary Committee's markup of <bill type="h" number="2316">H.R. 2316</bill>, several additional Republican amendments that would strengthen this bill were adopted by voice vote. One provided for a 1-year revolving door ban that would prohibit private lawyers and law firms who enter into contracts with congressional committees from lobbying Congress while under contract to such committee and for 1 year thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That amendment by Representative Chris Cannon was adopted by voice vote at the committee, and was passed out of the House of Representatives. But it is nowhere to be found in the bill before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, in May, Democrats supported and passed two motions to recommit offered by Republicans that contained even more ethics reforms. Those reforms required lobbyists to disclose which special projects they lobbied for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If a special interest lobbyist is having closed-door meetings with Members of Congress regarding programs that do not benefit all Americans but only benefit a small group of people in one part of the country, then those projects should be disclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican motion to recommit also closed the existing loophole that allows State and local government entities to give gifts and travel to Members and their staff that other entities cannot give. It makes little sense to exempt entities that operate on taxpayer dollars from the gift and travel ban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current rules allow taxpayer-funded entities to give gifts and travel to Members and staff while they try to convince those same Members and staff to send more Federal taxpayer dollars their way. That is not fair, and the Republican motion to recommit, which was adopted, would have ended that practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans' motion to recommit also contained a reverse revolving door provision that would have prohibited a congressional employee who was a registered lobbyist prior to their congressional employment from engaging in official business with their former private employer for a period of 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans' motion to recommit also included the Republican-amended text to <bill type="h" number="2317">H.R. 2317</bill>, which required that bundled contributions to political action committees, often referred to as PACs, be fully disclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Viewed in the harsh light of recent history, the legislation we consider  today is a hollow shell of reform. Just listen to the following list of reforms that Democrats have abandoned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions in this bill requiring the disclosure of contributions bundled together by lobbyists is weaker than the reforms passed in May, as this legislation requires the disclosure of bundled contributions exceeding $15,000 rather than the original $5,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That means less disclosure and less accountability to the American people. The weakened bundling disclosure provisions in this bill do not even cover bundled disclosures to PACs, a reform that 33 Democrats supported when it was accepted as part of the Republicans' motion to recommit <bill type="h" number="2317">H.R. 2317</bill>, and that 158 Democrats supported when it was accepted as part of the Republicans' motion to recommit <bill type="h" number="2316">H.R. 2316</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The newspaper Roll Call reported yesterday that, "The average Democratic incumbent raised over 63 percent more from PACs during the first half of this year than during the same period in 2005." Could that be why Democrats don't want to disclose the bundled contributions lobbyists give to PACs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also fails to contain the following reforms that 158 Democrats supported in May. The length of this list defines the credibility chasm that now separates the Democratic Party from American voters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision requiring the disclosure of bundled contributions by political action committees? Gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision requiring lobbyists to disclose the special projects they lobby for? Gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision prohibiting State and local governments from giving expensive gifts and lavish travel to Members of Congress in return for taxpayer dollars? Gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision prohibiting congressional employees who were lobbyists from engaging in official business with their former lobbyist employers? Gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last May, the Washington Post reported that the Democrats brought up their original legislation "after scrapping most key elements of an ethics package meant to deliver on Democratic promises to bring unprecedented accountability to Congress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, essential reforms have been thrown overboard, and the Democratic pledge of reform is sinking fast.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for his examination of the bill. We've worked on this bill together. I think we're in support of it, and I hope to enjoy the gentleman's continued success and cooperation in the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's very important that we understand that we are ending the pay-to-play K Street Project which, under this bill before us, now prohibits Members and their staff from influencing hiring decisions of private organizations on the sole basis of partisan political gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It subjects those who violate this provision to a fine and imprisonment of up to 15 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We prohibit lobbyists from providing gifts or travel to Members of Congress who have knowledge that the gift or travel is in violation of the Senate or the House rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require now lobbyist disclosure filings to be filed twice as often by decreasing the time from filing from semiannually to quarterly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require lobbyist disclosures in both the Senate and the House to be filed electronically and creates a public and searchable Internet database of such information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We increase civil penalties for knowing and willful violations of the Lobby Disclosure Act. We increase them by four times as much, from $50,000 to $200,000, and imposes a criminal penalty up to 5 years for knowing and corrupt failure to comply with the Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require the GAO to audit annually lobbyists' compliance with these disclosure rules and, further, require lobbyists to certify that they've not been given gifts or travel that would violate either Senate or House rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require the disclosure of businesses or organizations that contribute in excess of $5,000 and actively participate in lobbying activities by certain coalitions and associations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're requiring disclosure to the Federal Election Commission when lobbyists bundle over $15,000 semiannually in campaign contributions for any federally elected official, including the Senate, the House or presidential, or leadership PACs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require lobbyists to disclose to the Secretary of the Senate and the House Clerk their campaign contributions and payments to presidential libraries, inaugural committees or entities controlled by the name for or honoring Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely difficult and new way of controlling lobby operations. I think we are restoring the trust of the American people and our system of government, and I think we are living up to the title of this measure, honest leadership and open government.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California, the current ranking member and former chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr. Dreier.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to say what a privilege it is for me to be, as always, on the floor with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my good friend from Detroit (Mr. Conyers) and, of course, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, my friend from San Antonio (Mr. Smith).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I listen to the distinguished Chair go through the litany of items that are included in this measure, I couldn't help but think it's virtually identical to what we passed in the last Congress. I know there are a number of things we came to agree upon, and so that's why I rise today in somewhat quiet resignation over this so-called Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. I am not opposed to the bill. I am not opposed to the bill because, frankly, there is nothing to be opposed  to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that I sponsored that Mr. Smith referred to in the last Congress was repeatedly referred to by our leadership colleagues on the other side of the aisle as a sham. They regularly said that the items that frankly were just outlined by Mr. Conyers in this bill that he is describing, when I offered it, it was described as a sham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But my colleagues, unfortunately, while we were successful during the House consideration of the bill to bring it up to the sham level from its initial sub-sham status, I would argue that this bill is not much better overall on the substance, and it is far, far worse on the process, which is a big part of the responsibilities that I have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new majority, as we all know, promised us open conferences, with meaningful participation by the minority party. What we have here is a willful effort to avoid a conference entirely without any participation by Republicans or public disclosure of the language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules just last week complained to me about how the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee never told his ranking member about where and when conferences on tax bills were meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have got to hand it to the new majority. They have come up with a novel answer to that problem. Don't hold conferences at all. That way, you aren't even bothered with having to file a conference report. That's right, the most open Congress in history, which is what we have continued to hear this one described as, has not made the text of its ballyhooed lobbying bill available to the public or rank-and-file members anywhere, anywhere that we could find.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As late as 8:30 this morning, we checked the Speaker's Web site, the majority leader's Web site, the Judiciary Committee's Web site, even Thomas. It was nowhere to be found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were able, we were able, though, to get a copy of it. Guess how? We got it from a lobbyist. When I say that there was no participation by Republicans, I mean none, none whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, I have the greatest regard for my friend from Detroit (Mr. Conyers) who works so ably as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate his support for my amendment that I offered on floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, you can imagine my surprise when I discovered late yesterday that there were changes in my amendment in the document that we have in front of us. Now, these changes aren't  bad changes. I am not going to complain about the changes that were made. They probably actually improved the amendment; that's what the legislative process is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if the majority really wanted to declare a new day and live up to the promises of inclusion, calling me, asking me my thoughts on the change might have been a step in the right direction; but apparently the majority just couldn't be bothered with that at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a great deal missing from this bill that a majority of the House, including 138 Democrats, voted for, things like a reverse revolving door, requiring a lobbyist to disclose earmarks that they are lobbying for, and an end to the State and local governments lobbying loophole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite promises to the contrary, they haven't extended our earmark rules to cover authorizing and tax bills, which is one of the last things we did in this Congress. Unfortunately, we have yet to bring the new majority's level up to ours on dealing with that disclosure on authorizing and tax bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the majority pushes this bill through without any input from Republicans, they are responsible for its content. They are responsible for its content, not us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mourn this missed opportunity for bipartisanship, which we continue to hear about on a regular basis, and, frankly, grieve the broken promises which, not just Republicans, but the American people have been subjected to.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding and thank him for his extraordinary leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and would allay somewhat the grief that is felt by the former chairman of the Rules Committee, the ranking Republican.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on the one hand he says much of this bill is that which we passed last time offered by our friends on the minority side. If that is the case, we, as I understand the premise, we have adopted much of what you have proposed. It's hard to say that you weren't consulted when we have adopted what your contention is, much of what you have proposed. So I would hope that the grief would be allayed in that respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, let me say this. No conference. Why no conference? Because a Republican Member of the United States Senate wouldn't let us go to conference. That's why there was no conference. He stood day after day after day objecting to adopting this important reform package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, we couldn't go to conference. So you can't complain on the one hand we are not in conference when it is a Republican Senator from South Carolina who day after day, week after week, objected to doing just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is a proud day for this body. Again, I congratulate my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and a dramatic example of how the Congress that was elected last November pledging to clean up the culture of corruption is making good on its promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will talk about that a little bit at the end in terms of rules are nice, but performance is better. Last January, on the first day of this new, Congress we enacted sweeping ethics changes. Today, with this Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, we have a simple, straightforward purpose, to continue to restore public confidence in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Conyers, as I have, for his leadership in making possible this comprehensive reform measure. By shining a bright light on the campaign contributions that registered lobbyists bundle for Members of Congress, the conference report before us increases transparency and gives the American people important insight on the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By denying Members convicted of crimes their congressional pensions, the conference report ensures that Members who break their oath to uphold the laws of the land will not only suffer public disgrace and criminal sanction, but also lifetime financial loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason for taxpayers to subsidize criminal behavior of Members of Congress. Freshman Member Nancy Boyda deserves a great deal of credit for her work on this provision. By requiring Members engaged in any job negotiations to recuse themselves from any matter in which there is a conflict of interest, the conference report before us will end the practice of Members trying to cash in on the legislation they steer through this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how many of you had the opportunity to watch "60 Minutes" this past Sunday and hear the comments of Mr. Burton and Mr. Jones, but that is trying to address that critical problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As important as this legislation and the ethics changes made in January are, they alone will not ensure the integrity of our process and this institution. Rather, the Members of this House will ensure the integrity of this House when we conduct ourselves openly and honestly and hold accountable, through a vigorous pursuit of the enforcement of our rules by the Ethics Committee, hold accountable those who abide, do not abide by the rules in the highest ethical standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus we have an obligation to ensure that the Ethics Committee does the job that it was constituted to perform. It did not do so in the recent Congresses. The implementation of rules, while critical, must be followed by effective real enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This conference report is an important step forward, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle, including Mr. Smith, for the work that they have done through the years to bring us to this day and close by congratulating Mr. Conyers and the leadership of our Speaker in accomplishing this objective.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I would like to thank the majority leader for acknowledging this bill that we considered today largely mirrors the Republican legislation on ethics from the last Congress. As I mentioned in my opening statement a few minutes ago, I went through all the provisions that, in fact, had been carried over from the Republican bill last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would correct the majority leader in one respect, and that is many of the Republican reforms that were included in our motion to recommit which passed successfully with largely Democratic support earlier, all of those Republican reforms were eliminated. So this bill would have been much improved and much better if all the Republican reforms had, in fact, been included. I regret that was not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 1/2  minutes to my friend and my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise not in opposition to this bill, in fact, I plan to support the bill, and I think most of my colleagues will on both sides of the aisle, but to just say that I regret that this is an opportunity missed for the new Democratic majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it's all about wanting to have one more of the 6 for '06 to take home during the August recess and say, well, now, we have passed three of the six, I would say that it should only be 2.25 at the most, because, as my colleagues have pointed out, this reform is only about a fourth of what was brought to us in that first couple of weeks of the 110th as part of the 6 for '06, six promises that were made to the American people that if you elect us, the Democrats, to a new majority, this is what  we will deliver for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will say again that this is a tremendous opportunity missed on behalf of the new majority. This bill just absolutely does not go far enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking to that point, I want to point out that in the bill that we passed in the House last year, in the 109th, when Republicans enjoyed majority status, I had an amendment to this bill, which I think that we need to have as part of the bill today. It was passed by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, I regret, as the majority leader pointed out a minute ago, that the  other body did not go to conference on this good sound, solid bill that had my amendment as a part of it. But let me point out quickly what that amendment says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty years ago or more, in this Congress, a person could retire, a Member could retire and actually take what money they have in their campaign account, whether that's five figures or six figures or seven figures, could take that with them at retirement and convert that into personal gain. They could buy a Malibu beach home or a Rolls Royce car if they wanted to or send their children to the most expensive college in the Nation. Whatever they wanted to do, they could convert those campaign  funds to personal use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, in the wisdom of the Congress, that was ended about 20 years ago. Just before it ended, a number of Members retired, took retirement, so they didn't have to forfeit that money. That was a good change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a situation now where a lot of Members form what are known as leadership PACs. Now, they don't necessarily have to be in leadership. I formed a PAC that I called DOCPAC and raised a little money for that so-called leadership PAC. But what I am talking about is the fact that the most powerful Members of the Congress, both in the House and the Senate, formed these leadership PACs. Let me give you just a couple of names, not Members, but members of the PAC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Searchlight Leadership Fund PAC, in the other body, in the 2006 cycle raised $2,346,000; spent $300,000 of that money to support other candidates in that party, which is an appropriate use of that money. But $2 million of it was spent for God knows what, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another PAC, Hill PAC raised $2,900,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping America's Promises, $7,750,000 raised in the 2006 election cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>VOL-PAC, $8 million raised in the 2006 election cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing, Mr. Speaker, in the rules that says that money cannot be converted to personal use when these Members, some of whom have recently, retired or are going to retire in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would think that Members on both sides of the aisle would want to support something like this, to say that once a Member leaves this body that PAC money cannot be converted to personal use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me say once again, I have great respect for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I am not opposed to the bill, and I know we have worked hard and I plan to support it. I am just saying the opportunity was missed. We should have gone much further. I hope sometime in the near future we will solve some of these problems like this leadership PAC issue.</paragraph>

The Lobbying and Ethics Reform bill is not over with with today's work. Our job continues, and I will be looking forward for these constructive comments that they will be bringing to our attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record a letter from the Campaign Legal Center and others that support this legislation, and I would like you to know that the organizations' authors that signed this are among the most watchful and effective critics of the subject of ethics and lobbying that we have in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The letter was signed by the U.S. PIRG, the Public Citizen, the League of Women Voters, Democracy 21, Common Cause, the Campaign Legal Center, all who have said that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our organizations strongly urge you to vote for the lobbying and ethics reform legislation when it is considered by the House on the Suspension Calendar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation being presented to the House constitutes landmark reform of the Nation's lobbying disclosure laws and landmark reform of the Senate ethics rules. It is designed to help address the worst congressional corruption scandals in 30 years that were revealed during the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the legislation, for the first time citizens will be provided with a wealth of information about the multiple ways in which lobbyists and lobbyist organizations provide financial support to assist Members. For the first time, candidate campaign committees, leadership PACs, and political party committees will be required to disclose the bundled contributions raised for them by lobbyists and lobbying organizations. The legislation also includes fundamental reforms of the Senate ethics rules  very similar to the landmark House ethic reforms adopted at the beginning of the year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: Our organizations strongly urge you to vote for the lobbying and ethics reform legislation when it is considered by the House on the suspension calendar.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The legislation also includes fundamental reforms of the Senate ethics rules very similar to the landmark House ethics reforms adopted at the beginning of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The process being used in the House to vote on this legislation is the result of a Republican Senator, Jim DeMint (R-SC), blocking the House and Senate from going to conference on the lobbying and ethics reforms and bringing a conference report to the House and Senate floors for an up-or-down vote. There is absolutely no basis for a House member to vote against this legislation on process or substance grounds.</paragraph>

They have done an excellent job in helping us bring lobbying and ethics before the House, and I have no doubt that they will continue to monitor our success in the measure today, and what needs to  be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not closing down a chapter on a subject matter. Indeed, it will be a continuing responsibility of the Committee on the Judiciary to make sure that what we have put into law is not only effective and works but that it is enforced as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say, to correct the record, this bill does include violations of 18 U.S.C. 219, acting as a foreign principal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are several reforms in this measure, but what is most surprising are the reforms which are not in this measure, reforms which both Speaker Pelosi and Speaker Hastert supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this legislation, a Member of Congress convicted of income tax evasion would still have a full right to his Federal pension. Under this legislation, a Member of Congress convicted of  interstate and foreign travel or transportation in the aid of racketeering enterprises is fully able to have a pension. In fact, there are other felonies, all of which we included in previous reform measures which are were dropped from this reform measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Member can get a full Federal pension if they commit fraud by wire, radio, or television.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Member can get a full pension if they are caught and convicted of influencing or injuring an officer or juror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Member can get a full pension for intimidation to secure political contributions, or for the promise of appointment of a candidate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this legislation, a Member can get a full taxpayer pension if they make expenditures to influence voting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, previous reform legislation which Speakers Pelosi and Hastert both supported included 21 separate felonies which would kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony. But this legislation only includes four. It only includes four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the way that this happened is instructive. There was no amendment to this legislation allowed in the House of Representatives, because an amendment adding all of these felonies would have carried the day, as it carried in the past. Of course, there was no conference on this bill either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, a very limited set of reforms, including only four felonies, has gone forward, and the longer list of 21 separate public integrity felonies listed by the Department of Justice has not been included as it was in previous reform measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would simply say to the House that a Member of Congress convicted of income tax evasion should not get a taxpayer-funded pension. But that reform was left out.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>But every other one is. So I just wanted to refer the distinguished gentleman to the numbers of pages of felonies that are included in here, and I thank him for the one that concerns him mostly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to conclude my remarks by thanking all of my colleagues who have put time in on this matter. I want to thank the ranking member and the leadership on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a major accomplishment on our hands. What we need to do is to continue to follow through on implementing and improving anything in this measure that anybody would like to bring to our attention. But what we are doing is finally ending the cynical business as usual environment where big business and special interests dominate the legislative process to the detriment of the public interests. That is what all of these months and continuing wrangling and what our good government groups have  been looking at and criticizing us for far too frequently is now being corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a measure that every Member in the Congress can be proud of and support fully. A vote for this measure is a vote to end the culture of corruption. The time for <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> is now, and I accordingly urge my colleagues to support the measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report and commend the leadership as well as my colleagues involved in negotiating this landmark agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Referring to the House of Representatives, Alexander Hamilton once said, "Here, sir, the people govern." Today, that quotation no longer rings hollow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people are once again in charge of the people's House with this legislation. We followed through with our campaign promise by restoring integrity, transparency, and accountability in the way we do the people's business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of Congress, lobbyists, and special interests will share the responsibility to disclose information that sheds light on how the influence of money in politics shapes the outcome of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I am proud to support transparency in reporting "bundled" campaign contributions, as championed by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen), of whose legislation I am an original cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement will help avert corruption and back-room dealmaking that undermines this institution and the faith our constituents have in the way we do business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this conference agreement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the Honest Leadership, Open Government Act of 2007. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of it to clean up the culture of corruption in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first order of business in the 110th Congress has been to restore honesty and integrity to the U.S. House of Representatives. On the first day of the new Congress, we imposed tough new rules on Members of Congress to ban gifts from lobbyists, end the abuses connected to lobbyist-funded congressional travel, require full transparency and end the abuse of special interest earmarks, to ensure this Congress upholds the highest ethical standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> will now bring unprecedented transparency and accountability to lobbyists' activities. For the first time, lobbyists who collect campaign checks for Members of Congress must report this practice. Members of Congress will also be required to disclose if more than $15,000 in campaign contributions was collected on his or her behalf by a lobbyist. Lobbyists will be required to disclose contributions to Members' charities, events honoring Members, contributions intended to pay the cost of a  meeting and contributions to Presidential Library Funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lobbyists will now be required to file disclosure reports quarterly rather than semi-annually. The bill will establish an online, searchable public database of these lobbyist disclosure reports. In addition, this legislation increases criminal and civil penalties for violating the Lobby Disclose Act to $200,000 and five years in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have added additional restrictions on Members of Congress by requiring sitting Members to disclose job negotiations for post-Congressional employment and to recuse themselves if there is a conflict of interest. We will also establish an online, searchable public database of Members' travel and personal financial disclosure forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ongoing corruption scandals in the U.S. House and Senate anger me because they threaten the bonds between the American people and their elected leaders. Therefore, I am very pleased that this bill denies pension benefits to those Members of Congress convicted of corruption while serving the American people. I have always believed that public office is a public trust, and I work every day to live up to the trust the people of North Carolina's Second Congressional District have placed in me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for a new direction and to support honest leadership and an open government.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the Honest Leadership, Open Government Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the scandals of the past few years have made clear, it is time to change the way that business is conducted in Washington. The legislation before us today will implement several necessary reforms including new transparency for lobbyists who bundle campaign contributions, ending the K Street Project, expanding public disclosure of Members' travel and finances, and closing the revolving door between the legislative branch and post-employment lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> is supported by Common Cause, Democracy 21, Public Citizen, League of Women Voters, U.S. PIRG, and Campaign Legal Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this bill will help to restore the American people's confidence in their government. I want to commend Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Leadership for their commitment to getting this legislation through Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a freshman Member of this body, I believe it is critical that we restore the people's faith in the People's House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will bring transparency to lobbyists' activities and the relationship between Members of Congress and those who seek to influence us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is one in a series of steps we must take to change the status quo in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greater transparency, a willingness to change the way we do business, and adequate oversight are all essential elements of the reforms we have a responsibility to enact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The priorities of Iowa's Second District are my priorities as a Member of Congress. This bill is a step toward assuring my constituents, and all American citizens, that the House of Representatives remains in their hands.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="U.S. PIRG.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, as I have proudly supported each of this Democratic majority's initiatives to strengthen lobbying and ethics reform in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the current political climate it is increasingly clear that Congress must serve as an example for the Federal Government. With this bill's passage, Americans can be confident that their representatives in Congress will be held to an ever-higher standard of conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill closes the most abused loopholes by banning lobbyist-funded gifts and travel, reforming congressional earmarks, and by prohibiting Members from influencing outside hiring decisions for partisan gain. It also addresses the larger issues of reform by requiring public disclosure of bundled campaign contributions and lobbyist activity. And if that isn't enough, this bill also increases the punishment for Members and lobbyists who break the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's clear this bill raises the bar for congressional conduct. I look forward to its passage and to the creation of a more open government.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="U.S. PIRG.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="1">S.1</bill>, the Honest Leadership, Open Government Act of 2007. <bill type="s" number="1">S.1</bill> contains the contents of an agreement between the House and the Senate in the reconciliation of provisions between the respective bills of these institutions to impose the highest standards of ethics reform on the House and the Senate and to restrict the influence of special interests and lobbyists. The American people spoke loud and clear in their demand for change on Capitol  Hill. They conveyed a very strong message that an environment that accommodated Duke Cunningham and Jack Abramoff was unacceptable and that the culture of corruption must stop. As a result I urge the House to adopt this measure. This Conference agreement between the House and Senate contains some of the following provisions:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bans lavish convention parties--prohibits Members of Congress from attending national political convention parties held in their honor and paid for by lobbyists or their clients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creates new transparency for lobbyist political campaign fund activity and other financial contributions--requires disclosure when lobbyists bundle campaign contributions for any federal elected official, candidate or leadership PAC; and requires lobbyists to detail their own campaign contributions, and payments to Presidential libraries, Inaugural Committees or entities controlled by or named for Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ends K-Street Project--Prohibits Members of Congress and their staff from attempting to influence employment decisions in exchange for political access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imposes restrictions on corporate flights--requires Senators, Senate candidates and Presidential candidates to pay charter rates for trips on private planes; bars House candidates from accepting trips on private planes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expands public disclosure of lobbyist activities--requires lobbyists to file reports on their lobbying twice as often each year, and for the first time to file them electronically in a public, searchable database; and increases civil and criminal penalties for knowingly violating lobbying disclosure rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creates Congressional Pension Accountability--Denies Congressional retirement benefits to Members of Congress who are convicted of bribery, perjury and other similar crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains a provision that creates greater transparency at the intersection of campaign contributions and public policy. While existing campaign finance laws place limits on campaign contribution amounts, individuals that want to exceed the limits may do so by pulling together the contributions of third parties. This practice is known as "bundling". In and of itself, there is nothing wrong with this practice of aggregating the contributions of others. However, when the bundling  of contributions is done by someone who lobbies on behalf of a particular interest, this practice enables the lobbyist to enhance his or her stature with an official. This enhancement increases their opportunity to advance the cause of a special interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to guard against the use of this practice to exert an undue influence over public policy, I believe that we need to inject transparency into this process. Last year I introduced a bill to require that lobbyists disclose their bundling of campaign contributions on lobbying disclosure forms that are required under existing law in accordance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. While this bill was added to the lobbying reform bill by overwhelming support on a vote of 28 to 4 in the  House Judiciary Committee, it was stripped from the larger bill by the Republican leadership in the dead of the night. Ultimately, the underlying reform bill failed to pass the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the voters elected a Democratic House majority, in November of 2006 with a strong message of reform, I introduced a bill this year, <bill type="h" number="633">H.R. 633</bill>. This bill required that lobbyists disclose the contributions that they bundle on behalf of a candidate. After a series of clarifications were made to the bill, it was reintroduced as <bill type="h" number="2317">H.R. 2317</bill>. This bill required that registered lobbyists disclose the contributions that they bundle for a candidate that are equal to or exceed $5,000 on a quarterly  basis. "Bundling" was defined as the physical aggregation of contributions by a lobbyist or by attribution to a lobbyist for contributions received from other sources regardless the means of transmission. This bill passed the House on May 24, 2007 382/37 and was added to the Honest Leadership, Open Government Act of 2007 by a vote of 346 to 71 on the same day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the House passage of the bill, the House and Senate have been reconciling the differences between their respective bills. The Senate proposed on changing the bundling disclosure requirement by shifting the onus from the lobbyist to the candidate to disclose the receipt of contributions within reports already required under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The FEC disclosure would reflect bundled contributions from lobbyists that exceed $15,000 on a semi annual basis. The House  receded to the Senate's demands under the condition that the reporting shift, from the Lobbying Disclosure Act to the Federal Election Campaign Act, would not compromise or diminish the transparency of the bundled contributions provided by a lobbyist and hence, not reduce the availability of the information to the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reporting requirements in this bundling disclosure requirement apply to "bundled contributions" that have been made to the following covered entities: a candidate, political committees, party committees and Leadership PACs and Members who control Leadership PACs, and their agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subparagraph (i) defines a "bundled contribution" as any contribution that is "forwarded" by a lobbyist, or the agent of the lobbyist, to a covered entity. This includes all instances where a lobbyist transfers or otherwise delivers or forwards contributions to a covered entity. It includes the transfer regardless of whether the transfer occurs in conjunction with a fundraising event or in the absence of such an event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subparagraph (ii) is intended to capture bundling activity where the contributions may have been solicited in the aggregate by a lobbyist but where the contributions may have been provided at different times and/or transferred from the contributor or a party other than the lobbyist but is ultimately "credited" to the lobbyist. The "credit" that the lobbyist receives can be recorded through designations or other means of recognizing that a "certain amount of money" has been "raised" by  the lobbyist. However, the credit that is attributed to the lobbyist does not need to be memorialized in writing or captured within a database or any other contribution tracking system to trigger the reporting requirement. Moreover, the recognition that bundled contribution is attributed to a lobbyist does not need to be communicated back to the lobbyist; it merely means that a covered entity attributes the contribution to the lobbyist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The term "a certain amount of money" means that the covered entity has information that a dollar amount has been raised by &#xD0;the lobbyist who is credited with raising the money. The term does not require that the candidate or other covered entity knows the total amount raised by the lobbyist or that the lobbyist has reached the threshold amount for reporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subsection (5) requires the FEC to promulgate regulations implementing this disclosure requirement but prohibits the Commission from exempting from the disclosure requirement any lobbyist on the grounds that the lobbyist is authorized by the committee to engage in fundraising "or any other similar grounds." Moreover, this subsection explicitly prohibits the Commission from issuing a regulation to make this, or any similar grounds, the basis for an exception for the fundraising activities of  certain lobbyists from the bundling disclosure requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it must be noted that this provision is not designed to prohibit any action by a lobbyist. The purpose of this provision is to require disclosure. Therefore, I trust that the Commission, in its regulations, will strive to maximize the disclosure of contributions that have been bundled by lobbyists. This will bring much needed sunlight to the intersection of bundling and public polity and hopefully, will serve as a "disinfectant" to clean up any undue influence brought to bear by the  use of third party contributions by lobbyists.</paragraph>
