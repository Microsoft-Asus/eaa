  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO TOM KELLY -- (Senate - September 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11006">S11006</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>When Ada Mae Groetzinger left Russell High in the spring of 1946, Tom Kelly became the debate coach. Tom Kelly had not had experience as a debate coach. He was the drama coach. He directed the school plays "Lost Horizon" and "Nothing But The Truth," and was very adept at that. But having inherited an extraordinary group of high school debaters, Tom Kelly was our coach when we won the State AA championship in the spring of 1947.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the experience he gained at Russell High School, he then went on to Hutchinson Junior College, where he won national championships and was an outstanding teacher in his own right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He gave two lectures to us which have carried forth with me to this day. Every Friday, when we would prepare to go to a debate tournament, Mr. Kelly would organize the students and start to tell us about the forthcoming trip. His slogan was "Don't choke up in the clutch." That means: Don't get too nervous to do your job. "Don't choke up in the clutch." We would go to the tournament, characteristically come back having won the tournament, and on Monday he would again address the high school  debaters and say: "Don't rest on your laurels." Those were Tom Kelly's words, which have carried through to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made these comments and was reminded of the outstanding educational experience from those two high school debate coaches as I reflected on the events going to Salt Lake City for Kent Shearer's funeral. This past May, over the Memorial Day recess, Kent Shearer, Steve Mills, Gene Balloun, and I--the four debaters on the high school team--paid a visit to Ada Mae Groetzinger, who is since married and is now Ada Mae Groetzinger Haury, in her retirement home in Newton, KS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a good event to have the four of us get together. At that time, Kent was not feeling well. He suffered from emphysema. It was a good occasion for the group to get together with our high  school coach just a few months before Kent passed away.</paragraph>
