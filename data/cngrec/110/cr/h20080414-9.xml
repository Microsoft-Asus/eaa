    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the suffering of a quiet group of remarkable individuals is often overlooked by our culture. Victims of crime sometimes spend the rest of their lives trying to cope with being someone else's prey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These people are a cross section of America and include all races, ages, religions, and they come from all economic backgrounds. You see, violent crime plays no favorites and does not discriminate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, as neighbors, should be aware of and concerned about these victims. That is why we honor and remember them during this National Crime Victims Rights Week. Since 1981, each year in April, communities throughout these vast great plains have celebrated National Crime Victims Rights Week to promote victims' rights and to recognize victims, as well as those who advocate on their behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do victims justice by raising awareness of their plight and demanding that justice prevail in their lives, many of whom spend quiet lives of desperation. They are the forgotten participants in the judicial system, and we will forget them no more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
