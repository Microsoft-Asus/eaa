  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="TRIBUTE TO PEGGY EWING WAXTER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I commemorate the life of Peggy Ewing Waxter, a woman who worked tirelessly to promote positive social change and civil rights. Mrs. Waxter passed away last Tuesday, September 18, 2007, at the age of 103. The State of Maryland and our Nation have lost a remarkable woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1930s, Mrs. Waxter helped found the Waxter Center for Seniors in  Baltimore City. She also aided in the founding of various other organizations, including the University of Maryland Center for Infant Study, the Children's Guild of Baltimore, and the Maryland Committee for Children. She also helped establish the Baltimore Metropolitan Association for Mental Health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to working to improve the lives of seniors, women, and minorities, Peggy Waxter also served as chairwoman of the Volunteers Advisory Committee at Baltimore City Hospital, which is now the Johns Hopkins Bayview Hospital, and as head of the Northeast Symphony Society. Through these and numerous other service organizations, she influenced nearly every aspect of Baltimore society and was rightfully named by Baltimore Magazine one of the city's 11 most powerful women in 1978.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Baltimore is a better city because of Peggy Waxter's guiding hand. She is survived by her family: a daughter, Margaret Waxter Maher; a son, retired Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Thomas J.S. Waxter, Jr., with whom I was privileged to serve in the Maryland General Assembly from 1967 until 1971; 6 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren. I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the Waxter family, and I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering her today.</paragraph>
