    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the pages are helping me put up the portrait of an injustice. The picture shows two U.S. Border Agents on January 17, 2007, turning themselves in to United States marshals to begin serving 11 and 12 years respectively in Federal prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Border Agents Ramos, who is at the bottom of this portrait, and Compean, at the top, were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas. These men never should have been prosecuted, yet they are now handcuffed in Federal prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after months of silence, the President said in a television interview last week that he would take a sober look at the case and a tough look at the facts to see whether the agents should be pardoned. For the agents' sake, I am hopeful that the President will look into this case as soon as possible. The facts will tell the President what countless citizens and Members of Congress already know, that the U.S. Attorney's Office was on the wrong side in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agents fired shots during a foot chase with the smuggler who had fled in a van they were pursuing. The van contained approximately $1 million worth of marijuana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compelling physical evidence, the angle of the bullet that struck the drug smuggler, makes it clear that the smuggler was pointing something at the agents as he ran away, and the agents fired in self-defense. Yet the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents almost exclusively on the testimony of an admitted drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler for his testimony against our Border Agents. This drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas; was permitted to return Mexico; and is now suing the border patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. He is not an American citizen. He is a criminal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the agents were convicted, three of the 12 jurors have submitted sworn statements that they were misled into believing that there could be no dissent in the jury's decision and therefore believe that they had to give in to the majority opinion of guilt. Still, the judge refused to overturn the verdict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the extraordinary details surrounding the prosecution of this case assure that justice has not been served. The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General in this case has outrageously claimed that Agents Ramos and Compean admitted they were out to shoot Mexicans and confessed to knowingly shooting an unarmed suspect. But the Inspector General has failed to make good on his promise to deliver documents to Members of Congress to support these claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 2 years after the conclusion of the agents' trial, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas has answered repeated requests for transcripts of the trial with nothing but excuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, real justice does not fear the truth. For the sake of the agents and their families and for the sake of the American people who they were working to protect, I encourage the President of the United States to review the facts on this case as soon as possible. The President alone can immediately reverse this injustice by pardoning these two innocent men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I want to say to the families of Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean that there are Members on both sides of the political aisle in this House of Representatives that will not sit still until the President pardons these two men. They deserve the best of America, not the worst, and God bless America.</paragraph>
