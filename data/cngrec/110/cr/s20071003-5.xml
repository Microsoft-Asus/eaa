    <paragraph>Mr. President, those of us in the Senate do not take for granted our Chaplain. I want those who were fortunate enough to hear his prayer this morning to understand that the Chaplain of the Senate, Barry Black, is a brilliant man. He has a photographic memory. He is a great writer, as indicated by the prayer he delivered. The prayer itself says it all about what our function should be as legislators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His mother was a great mother. He talks about her all the time. He is from Baltimore. She used to give him pennies for memorization, and even at that, I am sure she lost a lot of money because he has such a great mind. He is the only person I have dealt with over the years with a memory that is comparable to Senator Byrd who has the ability to recite things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make sure those listening to this prayer understand that we don't take this great man for granted. He is a retired admiral from the U.S. Navy, a fine man.</paragraph>
