  <narrative>IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11553]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what I'm hearing from my constituents is they are still very concerned about our national security, about border security, about the security on their streets and in their communities. That's why I would like to raise one issue with the House this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the second time in the last several months, a mobile foreign consulate has traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, on the western edge of my district, to issue government IDs and passports, the latest courtesy of the Guatemalan Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, many illegal immigrants in this country are using these matricula consular cards to access American financial markets. And some American financial institutions are offering illegal immigrants credit cards and access to our financial services and financial markets based on the issuance of these cards. Only reason you need one, you're in the country illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've even had an industry representative tell me that they think they should be able to "bank illegal immigrants."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, that's why I've introduced <bill type="h" number="1314">H.R. 1314</bill>, the Photo ID Security Act, to close this loophole that allows illegal immigrants access to these services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all to join me in sponsorship of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
