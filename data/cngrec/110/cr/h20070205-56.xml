  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time that the U.S. ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, or CEDAW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The treaty has been in force since 1981 and has been ratified by 185 countries; 185 countries cannot be wrong, and they include such countries as Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The U.S. stands out as the only Western country that has not ratified the treaty and, in doing so, keeps company with Iran, Sudan, and Somalia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women continue to be subjected to severe human rights violations simply because of their gender. Women in many parts of the world are unable to receive a basic education, earn a living, own or inherent property, or protect themselves against HIV/AIDS. Violence against women continues to be a terrible problem in all corners of the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Mexican cities of Juarez and Chihuahua, over 400 women have been killed since 1993. In Guatemala over 2,500 women and girls have been murdered since 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women are still stoned to death and killed by members of their family in the name of honor. In 2002 at least 270 women were murdered in "honor killings" in the Punjab Province of Pakistan alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic violence continues to hurt and kill women at alarming rates. In Russia 70 percent of married women have been hurt in one form or another of violence from their husbands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CEDAW is an important tool in combating discrimination and human rights abuses against women around the world. It seeks to ensure that  women have equal access to education, public health, credit, property rights, as well as prevent violence against women. There have been numerous positive changes because of the convention, such as the implementation of equality legislation, the eradication of harmful practices such as sex slavery, and changes in inheritance  laws. But there is clearly a great deal more to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one of the most powerful nations in the world, the U.S. must be the leader in the fight against these violations of women's human rights. Our refusal to ratify the treaty sends the message that CEDAW is not important and does not need to be enforced. There is no valid reason why the U.S. should not ratify CEDAW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has voted twice to send the convention to the full Senate for ratification, first in 1994 and then again in 2002; but it has never been voted on by that body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. is already substantially in compliance with the treaty and agrees with its fundamental principles of nondiscrimination and equality for women. We cannot claim to be a defender of human rights without including over half of the world's population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ratifying CEDAW is something the U.S. can do that can make a difference in the lives of thousands of women around the globe. So what are we waiting for? We should move forward and ratify it.</paragraph>
