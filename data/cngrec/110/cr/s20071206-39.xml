    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the loss of Vietnam veteran Charles E. "Butch" Joeckel, who was buried yesterday with military honors at the Columbarium in Arlington National Cemetery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Butch was raised in Colmar Manor, MD, graduating from Bladensburg High School in 1965. In 1966 he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and fought for his country in Vietnam. He was seriously wounded during the Tet Offensive in 1968, losing both of his legs above the knees. For his heroic service, Butch received the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat Valor, and numerous meritorious citations, medals, and honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Butch's service to his country did not end in Vietnam. He became a national service officer for the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), and in 1988 he rose to the position of DAV national adjutant, serving in this capacity until 1993. He served on the board of directors of Help Disabled War Veterans, and contributed his time, wise counsel, and strong efforts to the President's Task Force to Improve Access to Health Care for our Nation's Veterans at the National Veterans Legal Services Program.  In 2004 he was appointed to the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Butch was an inspiration to all who knew him, and especially for those who were disabled. He accepted the heavy responsibility of "role model" for disabled war veterans with grace, dignity, and a special twinkle of humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of his selfless service to his country, Butch's family always came first. He is survived by his wife Dianne; his three children, Chuck, Tammy and Scott; his father, Charles, Sr.; his sister and brother-in-law; three sisters-in-law; 11 nieces and nephews; and seven grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Butch was an American patriot who believed in his country and fought for his country and the veterans who built it. America owes him our thanks for his contributions and sacrifices. Our country lost an American original, who will be missed by many.</paragraph>
