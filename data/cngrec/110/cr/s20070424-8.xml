    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I, before I begin my comments prepared for today, make two quick comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 1, I note the passing of Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia and a major figure in the transition between the Communist rule and the present democracy that exists in Russia. Like many Members of the body, I had the opportunity to meet Boris Yeltsin. That is one of the privileges we have as Senators--we get to meet important people from around the world. I can't pretend to know him at all. I simply shook his hand and said hello. But I was in Russia not long after he took power, spent time in  the U.S. Embassy there, and noted the impact he had on helping bring Russia into the modern world, the world of democracy, and out of the ancient world, the world of tyranny. He had his faults. He had his problems. But he played a pivotal role, and we should take a moment to recognize that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one quote attributed to him that I enjoyed personally with respect to our life here has to do with the Library of Congress. When my constituents come to Washington, I tell them: You need to go see the Library of Congress, the Jefferson Building. Aside from the  Capitol itself, it is the most beautiful building on Capitol Hill, and maybe in Washington. Boris Yeltsin is said to have gone into the Library of Congress and looked around at that magnificent  lobby and then questioned: How did you get a building like this? You didn't have any czars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having been to the buildings in the Kremlin and seeing the kinds of things the czars built, I understand that the Library of Congress probably would have impressed him.</paragraph>
