    <paragraph>Mr. President, next week, Idahoans of Hispanic and Latino heritage will be joining others in the United States and Mexico to celebrate the beginning of the decade-long battle to liberate Mexico from Spain almost 200 years ago. They gather to celebrate "El Grito de Dolores," or "The Cry from Dolores," issued by Father Miguel Gregorio Antonio Ignacio Hidalgo y Costilla Gallaga Mondarte Villasenor, better known as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Mexican priest and revolutionary leader.  Cura Hidalgo, although ethnically a criollo, or Mexican of Spanish or European descent, became sympathetic at a young age to the terrible plight of the Indians and mestizos--those of mixed ancestry--who had been subjugated by the Spanish for 300 years in Mexico. Hidalgo was an intellectual, well-versed in a number of languages and well-read. Some historians tell that his classmates called him "el zorro," or "the Fox." He was  also known to be an entrepreneur and humanitarian. With the intention to better the plight of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hidalgo's call to independence was obviously not recorded, and historical accounts cannot agree on the words of his exact speech, but it is understood that early on the morning of September 16, 1810, Cura Hidalgo, instead of delivering mass, rang the church bell and delivered a call to arms that has come to be known as "El Grito de Dolores," or, simply, "El Grito." The armed Indians and mestizos, under the command of Hidalgo, fellow revolutionary Ignacio Allende and others, marched to the  provincial capitol, Guanajunto, and, just 2 weeks after "El Grito," won a stunning battle with their now 20,000-strong army. Although Hidalgo was captured 9 months later and executed on July 30, 1811, the storm that had been unleashed could not be stopped. Mexico successfully fought and won its independence from Spain in 1821.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Idahoans and other Americans of Mexican descent have a proud heritage in this early freedom fighter. Much like the tradition of our American Founding Fathers, the seeds of revolution sprouted in the fertile soil of intellectual debate and a recognition of the inherent equality of all human beings regardless of race, gender or ethnicity. As people in Idaho and across the United States celebrate Mexico's independence and those young freedom fighters 200 years ago, parallels are strong with Mexican  Americans today who are fighting to keep the United States free from terror here at home. How fitting, then, for the week of September 11 that we also remember Hidalgo's "El Grito!"</paragraph>
