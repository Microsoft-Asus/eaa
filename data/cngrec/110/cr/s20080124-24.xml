    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Larry Healy, who has been named the 2008 Agri-Business Citizen of the Year. Larry has been employed by Campbell Supply Company for 20 years, and currently manages one of its Sioux Falls stores. He is also actively engaged in community activities and embodies the true spirit of the American farmer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry grew up in Montrose, SD, where he first worked in his father's welding and repair shop before becoming employed in the farm department at Campbell Supply in Sioux Falls. In 1990, he was promoted to store manager at the Rock Rapids, IA, store, a position in which he proudly served for 11 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, Larry transferred back to Sioux Falls where he continued to serve as store manager. Since then, Larry has become involved with the Sioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce Agri-Business Division, where he has served on the Agri-Business Division Council and volunteers with Agri-Business activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry chaired the Ag Appreciation Day for 2 years and has worked with the chamber and hundreds of volunteers on events such as an event during the Sioux Empire Fair that provided a complimentary meal to approximately 5,000 area farmers. He also chaired the Ag Division in 2006-07.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry is proud to work for Campbell Supply Company, which has been family owned since its founding. The Campbell family believes in giving back to the community and supporting local agriculture, something Larry sincerely appreciates because he understands the important role farmers play in American cities and towns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry sets a fine example for all involved in advancing our Nation's great agricultural foundations. I commend him for this award, and I wish him continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
