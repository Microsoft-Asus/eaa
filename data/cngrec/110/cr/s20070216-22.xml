    <paragraph>Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to come before the Senate today to speak on legislation that the Senate passed last night, <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month, I introduced <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill> with Senators Reid, Leahy, Feinstein, Boxer, and Menendez. This straightforward measure would incorporate C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez--a truly remarkable civil rights leader and American--into the title of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act passed last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez is an American hero. Like the venerable American leaders who are now associated with this effort, he sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable in America. For this reason, he continues to be an important part of our country's journey on the path to a more inclusive America. C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez believed strongly in our American democracy and saw the right to vote as a fundamental cornerstone of our freedom. I believe it is fitting that his name be a part of the  reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senator Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for his support. I sincerely appreciate his efforts to quickly steer <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill> through his committee. I enthusiastically supported last year's Voting Rights Act reauthorization. I firmly believe that this landmark civil rights legislation has opened the door for millions of Hispanic Americans to fully exercise their right to participate in our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adding C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez's name sends an important message to Hispanic Americans. It signals to the Nation's 40 million Hispanics that the Voting Rights Act has been reauthorized with their interest and constitutional rights in mind. During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, Senator Leahy offered an amendment that incorporated another important American leader. His amendment to add William C. Vel&amp;#225;squez to the title of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization  bill has my strong and unequivocal support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1974, Mr. Vel&amp;#225;squez founded the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, SVREP. Using his powerful slogan--Su Voto es Su Voz or your vote is your voice--he energized the Hispanic community and registered many to vote. Mr. Vel&amp;#225;squez envisioned a time when Latinos would play an important role in the American democratic process. When SVREP was established, there were only 1,566 Latino elected officials. Today, there are over 6,000 Hispanics elected to local, State, and Federal  office, including 3 U.S. Senators and 23 U.S. Representatives. Like C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez, Mr. Vel&amp;#225;squez did not live to see the remarkable progress our country has made. He passed away in 1988 from kidney cancer. However, I am sure he is looking down on this body with joy and pride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Senator Cornyn sought to include the name of former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also played an integral part in the history of the Voting Rights Act, and Dr. Hector Garcia, founder of the American GI Forum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Jordan was certainly a remarkable civil rights and social justice leader and I support her inclusion in my legislation. In addition, Dr. Garcia fought for half a century for civil and education rights for Mexican Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former President Bill Clinton, who first met Dr. Garcia while registering voters in the Rio Grande Valley in 1972, called him a "national hero." In the coming months, I will work with Senator Cornyn to find another appropriate manner to honor Dr. Garcia's work with the American G.I. Forum. The American G.I. Forum was established in the wake of World War II when Hispanic veterans returned home and were categorically denied their G.I. Bill of Rights benefits. Dr. Garcia was propelled  into the national spotlight when he fought to have Army PVT Longoria buried alongside others in the local cemetery in his hometown of Three Rivers, TX. Dr. Garcia called Members of Congress and alerted the press to this injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within 24 hours, he received a telegram from then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson that stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I deeply regret to learn that the prejudice of some individuals extends even beyond this life. I have no authority over civilian funeral homes. Nor does the federal government. However, I have made arrangements to have Felix Longoria buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery ... where the honored dead of our nation's war rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our Nation moves forward toward the next chapter of civic equality and inclusion, starting, last year, with the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, it is fitting that we honor civil rights leaders whose contributions and courage helped pave the way for today's more inclusive democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Senate's passage of <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>, my attention and efforts will now focus on the U.S. House of Representatives. I am hopeful that they will approve this measure so that this landmark law can now be known as the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez, Barbara Jordan, William C. Vel&amp;#225;squez, and Hector P. Garcia Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the accomplishments of the Kansas Air National Guard, and specifically of the 190th Air Refueling Wing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have made several statements on the floor recently regarding my feelings on these resolutions. And today, instead of repeating my feelings on the subject, I would like to acknowledge some of our country's brave men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, our Nation has been relying heavily on our National Guard in the war on terror. In Kansas, it is no different. However, these men and women continually rise to the challenge, saving lives and defending democracy at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the 190th Air Refueling Wing in Kansas. The enormous sacrifice and dedication of the men and women serving in 190th brings great credit to their unit and to the State of Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This outstanding organization began as the 117th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Hutchinson, KS. The unit was federally recognized on February 23, 1957.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week they will celebrate 50 years of flying aircraft--from the F-80 to the B-57 to the KC-135 tankers they maintain today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1967, the 190th has been based in our State capital of Topeka, KS. They continue to be leaders in the State and in the Air National Guard, which is evident through their most recent awards--the Spaatz trophy for outstanding Air National Guard Flying Wing and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to debate the difficult topic of our presence in Iraq, I hope my colleagues will take a moment to recognize, with me, the outstanding contributions of our Nation's troops. Not only has our volunteer force proven themselves the best in the world, our citizen soldiers have proven themselves second to none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will remember the personal sacrifices of these men and women as we debate our support for them and their mission.</paragraph>
