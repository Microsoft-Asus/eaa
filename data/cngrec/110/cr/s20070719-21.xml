  <narrative>RECOGNIZING DEBRA BROWN STEINBERG -- (Senate - July 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9609">S9609</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to recognize Debra Brown Steinberg for receiving an Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations. This award acknowledges her work representing immigrants whose family members died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. As a recipient of the award, Debra joins an elite group of distinguished Medal of Honor recipients such as Lee Iacocca, former Chrysler CEO and author  of "Where Have all the Leaders Gone?", as well as several former U.S. Presidents including Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Steinberg, moved with compassion, responded to the attacks by playing a vital leadership role in creating the New York Lawyers for the Public Interest 9/11 Project in early October 2001. She also played an important role in the creation of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, which awarded a total $7 billion to family members of individuals killed in the 9/11 attacks, by drafting the New York City Bar Association's comments on the interim and final regulations for the fund. Since that time,  she has worked selflessly to ensure that the family members of victims of 9/11 are cared for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 6 years after the 9/11 attacks, Debra Brown Steinberg is still fighting for the families of victims of the terrorist attacks--specifically immigrants without legal status in the United States who, after facing the traumatic loss of a family member on 9/11, now face potential deportation. As our Nation continues to mourn the loss of friends and family members who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Ms. Steinberg has set an example for all of us by helping families that have suffered greatly.  Her selfless and persistent efforts have given these immigrant families hope that one day they will be able to grieve freely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to her work representing these immigrant families through the 9/11 Compensation Fund process, she has helped to draft the September 11 Family Humanitarian Relief and Patriotism Act, <bill type="s" number="615">S. 615</bill>, which I introduced with Senator Lautenberg on February 15, 2007. This legislation would help immigrants whose family members were killed in the attacks heal from the tragedy as our Nation continues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our tradition teaches us to have compassion for the widow, the orphan, and the stranger among us. Ms. Steinberg's action representing the families of immigrant victims of 9/11 exemplifies such compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have much to learn from Debra Steinberg, and I am proud to honor her achievements before my colleagues in the Senate.</paragraph>
