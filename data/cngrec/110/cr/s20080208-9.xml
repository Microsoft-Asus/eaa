    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like for my colleagues to join me in congratulating Forest Avenue Academic Magnet Elementary School in Montgomery, AL, which has been named a No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School of 2007. I recently met with principal Jan Hill and teachers Jennifer Rodopoulos and Gina Thomase from Forest Avenue, and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to talk with them about education and this great achievement. Blue Ribbon Schools are selected because they are showing  dramatic achievement gains in working with students from disadvantaged backgrounds or they are in the top 10 percent of their State on State tests. This is a remarkable accomplishment, and I applaud the hard work principal Jan Hill and the many other hard-working faculty and staff have done to receive this high honor. I know that the lives of students at these schools are being changed.</paragraph>
