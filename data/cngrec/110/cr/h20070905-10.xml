    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week I was fortunate to visit Mexico City as a part of a bipartisan trip organized by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Our trip provided an excellent opportunity for my colleagues and me to meet with prominent Mexican leaders in business, journalism and government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also provided a forum to discuss ongoing political and economic changes in Mexico and ways in which we can improve the relationship between the United States and Mexico. We discussed civic and political life in both countries, how we can work more closely with Mexican partner institutions to help bring about a more open, competitive and equitable society. One example is the security issues we both face, one which we share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our relationship with our friend and neighbor Mexico is critically important. It cries out for more cooperation and engagement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars and its Mexico institute for facilitating this important dialogue. I know I was better able to get a picture of the state of democracy in Mexico, the shared goals and challenges that confront both of our countries, how we can be better neighbors to one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we can continue this important conversation and build a better future for the United States and for Mexico.</paragraph>
