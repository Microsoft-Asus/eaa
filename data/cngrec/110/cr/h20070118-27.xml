  <chair> For what purpose does the gentleman from Texas rise?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to a question of personal privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the question of personal privilege to which I rise is one regarding the tarnish that is on my reputation and the reputation of others here in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had heard for the last couple of years the term "culture of corruption"; and, frankly, one of the things that I looked forward to is an end to all this discussion about corruption that tarnishes each one of us. And I know for all of the people whom I am close to it is a big deal as far as our reputation when it is tarnished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what I would submit is that in the last 2 weeks that we have not cleared a culture of corruption; that a cloud of corruption has hovered over this body, it hovers over me now, tarnishing all that we are and that I am. And to have an American territory excluded from a minimum wage bill that directly benefits one of the Members, in fact the Speaker and a company----</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Under rule IX, it is provided in the precedents that any time someone's reputation has been tarnished or sullied, it may be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would in fact direct you to the second page of section 708 regarding the prior usage for the question of personal privilege. And you will find on the second page of the reference in section 708 of the Rules and Practice Manual that Former Speaker Jim Wright rose to a question of personal privilege and he addressed a matter that was sullying the reputation of the House, and him in particular, and addressed it in order to clear the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look underneath that in that same page, it references Speaker Gingrich, who rose to a question of personal privilege in order to clear the air and the cloud and allegation of corruption that had arisen. And then, beneath that you will see a reference of a precedent from Speaker HASTERT in 2000 who rose to a question of personal privilege to clear the air and clear the question of malfeasance over the issue of the selection of the Chaplain.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Chair would be pleased to examine the basis on which the gentleman from Texas would rely, individually, to be recognized on a point of personal privilege.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, then perhaps it would be better for the Speaker to come so we can clear the air and get this matter behind us so we can move forward in a bipartisan manner. If it was a staff member or someone else that allowed American Samoa to be exempted, we can get it cleared. The question of personal privilege would disappear. I would rise to make that----</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I have a constitutional point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may state his point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, under Article I, section 6, a matter that was discussed at some length in the past year, it says that for any speech or debate in either House, they, the Senators and Representatives, shall not be questioned in any other place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the only place in which a question of personal privilege, in which a matter that is tarnishing anyone's reputation or everyone's reputation in here may be addressed. If I will not be allowed to go further with the question of personal privilege, I would ask the Speaker to rise to a question of personal privilege as the last three Speakers have under Article I, section 6, clear the air, clear the cloud of corruption that is hovering over us so we can move forward in a clean and wholesome,  bipartisan environment. And I will do as the Parliamentarian has requested.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Under the precedents of this House, the Chair would be pleased to examine any documentary evidence the gentleman might bring to her attention in order to be able to proceed on a question of personal privilege. The Chair presently has no basis for decision. The Chair would ask the gentleman to conform to precedent to be allowed to proceed. The Chair has not been provided anything to examine as the basis of his question of personal privilege.</chair>

    <paragraph>Is the Speaker asking or directing that I bring in articles  and things into this House to present to the Speaker here in this floor of the House?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair at this moment is unable to identify a valid basis for a question of personal privilege. The Chair would encourage the gentleman to give the Chair a basis for decision.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>The law on its face and what we just passed exempted a territory. It should be very clear.</paragraph>
