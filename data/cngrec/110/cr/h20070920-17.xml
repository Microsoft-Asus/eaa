    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Frank Beckmann upon the 35th anniversary of his distinguished broadcasting career at WJR, the great voice of the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1972, Frank Beckmann has steadily risen through the station's ranks until today he stands as a beloved, in most quarters, Detroit radio personality. Frank's iconic status was cemented in February of 2003 when the "Frank Beckmann Show" debuted. Over the ensuing years, Frank's commitment to providing fair and candid news has earned him a legion of fans and countless awards, which he, no doubt, is at the present time trying to count regardless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the years, Frank has enlightened and entertained radio audiences with his laid back humor, his probing interviews and his male pattern baldness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Frank Beckmann's loyalty to his listeners, dedication to the truth, and enduring contribution to broadcasting, our community, and our country.</paragraph>
