    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to honor an exceptional group of teenagers from my home district, the Bentonville High School Chamber Choir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The choir, comprised of juniors and seniors, is one of only four across the Nation chosen to go to Carnegie Hall next week for the National High School Choral Festival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the direction of Terry Hicks, the choir has participated in many regional and national competitions, representing Arkansas and the Third District with class. We are privileged to have students such as the Bentonville Chamber Choir living in and representing the State of Arkansas, and I commend their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish them the best of luck on their performance at the world-famous Carnegie hall.</paragraph>
