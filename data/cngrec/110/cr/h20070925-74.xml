  <narrative>CHIP REAUTHORIZATION AND DENTAL HEALTH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10887]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express my appreciation to Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Dingell and our entire Congress which has passed a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for an additional 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I would have preferred a bill with more funding to cover additional children, I am pleased that the $35 billion increase agreed to by House and Senate negotiators will bring health coverage to approximately 10 million children in need, preserving coverage for the 6.6 million who are currently enrolled in a program, while reaching many others who are eligible but not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that the agreement ensures quality dental coverage for all children enrolled in CHIP. This provision became a major initiative for me following the tragic death of a 12-year-old Maryland boy named Deamonte Driver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Deamonte died February of this year when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. Eighty dollars worth of dental care might have saved his life, but Deamonte was poor and homeless. He did not have access to a dentist. Deamonte Driver's case was rare and extreme, but he was by no means alone in his suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, dental decay is the second most common chronic childhood disease in this country. And it is preventable. Few public health challenges of this magnitude are so easy to address. We are faced with this problem because we have systematically failed to provide children with the care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Approximately 9 million children are uninsured in this country, but more than twice that amount, 20 million, are without dental insurance. That is why I am so glad that we will not only ensure the health coverage of 10 million children, but ensure that they have access to dental care as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us in the Maryland delegation stood up in support of this vitally important initiative; and in a Congress-wide push, we were joined by 60 of our colleagues. On this issue, Democrats and Republicans from both Chambers have put aside differences to draft critically important legislation that will help American children. Unfortunately, we have received nothing but push-back from the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an arrogant attempt to interfere with the business of Congress, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a letter to States on August 17 that has the potential of drastically limiting some States' ability to implement CHIP. <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> clarifies States' ability to implement the law, and it also addresses the President's concern that CHIP would not go to cover the Nation's poorest children. On this point, let me be clear: this legislation provides health insurance coverage to poor children,  children who were already eligible for the benefit but were not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush is playing politics with our children's health by threatening to veto the bipartisan CHIP reauthorization and deny 10 million low-income kids the health care they need and deserve. The President has instead expressed support for his own CHIP proposal, which will result in 84,000 low-income children losing their health care coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that my colleagues sent a strong message to the President by voting in favor of the bicameral CHIP reauthorization.</paragraph>
