  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400290" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for far too long the topic of mental health has been pushed aside and swept under the rug. You don't see it, you don't talk about it, and you don't hear about it. It connotes people are crazy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, we cannot continue to ignore that mental illness does not discriminate. It touches all regardless of race, of gender, of class or of religion. It is time we address this issue at the forefront honestly and openly. Too many of our family members of our friends, our coworkers and especially our veterans and soldiers have had to suffer with mental illnesses in silence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Surgeon General, 57 million Americans suffer from some form of mental illness. Despite findings that most mental illnesses are highly treatable, only one in three individuals suffering from these illnesses seek and or receive any treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This low treatment can be attributed to the strong stigma associated with mental health issue that is still pervade and persist. Twenty percent of our United States population suffers from a diagnosable, treatable mental disorder, making the mental illness the leading cause of disability in our Nation, affecting our businesses and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mental health and well-being of Americans are critical issues that affect not only the health of our communities, the quality of life, and, as importantly, our economic stability. A new report by the National Institute of Mental Health found that serious mental illnesses cost Americans at least $193 billion a year in lost earnings alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our action is far overdue. We have had tests, screening for breast cancer, for heart attacks, for strokes and a myriad of other diseases and conditions. We have not yet woken up to the fact that the brain functions are vital to our body's health and survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical that we will destigmatize mental illness so that our children, our families, our veterans receive the necessary help they need to lead productive lives with support from their families and their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respectfully encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution to recognize May as Mental Health Month. We must all come together on this critical issue. It is vital that we recognize the scientific facts and real findings regarding mental health and work to remove the stigma associated therewith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By increasing awareness of mental health issues we can insure that individuals have access to services including early detection and early prevention, and, most of all, to assure parity in our medical delivery systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will allow us to improve the lives of those suffering from mental illness and their loved ones while reversing the negative impact that mental illness has had on our economy, on our families, and on our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1134, acknowledging the month of May as National Mental Health Month. Mental Health Month has been recognized by Congress for over 50 years and has continued to raise awareness in our communities and to lower the stigma associated with mental disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to express my gratitude to the national and community organizations working to promote public awareness of mental health, providing the proper information for families affected by mental illness. Your work is critical to increasing the quality of life for those with mental illnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the author of the resolution, Congresswoman Grace Napolitano of California, for her leadership in helping Americans' well-being and addressing mental disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would ask if Congressman Mike Castle of the great State of Delaware could be the minority floor manager for the balance of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding time, but I also want to commend her for the tremendous leadership that she continues to provide on this critical issue of mental health, mental illness. I am pleased to join with her in support of <bill type="hr" number="1134">H. Res. 1134</bill>, recognizing and acknowledging Mental Health Awareness Month during the month of May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with Representative Napolitano that mental health is one of the major health issues facing our society, and yet it does not get the kind of attention that it needs and deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we think of all of the individuals who will suffer from substance abuse, all of the individuals who find themselves perplexed and not quite knowing how to navigate the society in which we live, and when we consider the fact that we have not reached the point of providing parity consideration nor parity treatment for mental illness, it's appropriate that we recognize May as Mental Health Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I congratulate the gentlewoman from California for her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also rise in strong support of the legislation. I think mental health is something that needs awareness in this country. What this resolution does in dedicating the month to it is very significant, and I would encourage support of all Members here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400290" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I really am grateful to my colleagues on the other side for their support. This has been a bipartisan effort, both with Representative Murphy, myself, and members of the Mental Health Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been quite important to us to continue working in airing the issue for this Nation's ability to be able to understand that we need to have more focus on how mental health affects our daily lives, our children in school, our seniors, mental health depression, our veterans, our soldiers in war after several deployments, all of those are parts of the whole that we need to understand in how it affects our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army recently issued a memorandum to train the chain of command on mental health issues. They are encouraging their servicemembers to talk to their commanders on these issues openly and without fear of retribution in certain areas where they have already been deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parity was passed in February in the House, and it is a good first step and must be signed into law and it will help not only families but business as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the time my colleagues have put into this. It is an issue that is very pervasive and we need to encourage more effort into it, not only in funding for research, but also in assistance to be able to render services so that individuals who suffer from these illnesses can continue good, productive lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time, and I have no other speakers, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't believe we have any other speakers at this time, so I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400290" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have just one more word of thanks to my colleagues on both sides and I ask for continued support of this bill by a "yes" vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1134">H. Res. 1134</bill>, supporting the goals and ideals of Mental Health Month. I would first like to thank my distinguished colleague, Representative GRACE NAPOLITANO of California, for introducing this important legislation. This legislation designates the month of May to raise awareness about mental health conditions and the importance of mental wellness for all. The mental health and well-being of Americans is a critical  issue that affects not only the quality of life, but also the health of our communities and our economic stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the turn of this century, thanks in large measure to research-based public health innovations, the lifespan of the average American has nearly doubled. Today, our Nation's physical health has never been better. Moreover, illnesses of the body once shrouded in fear--such as cancer, epilepsy, and HIV/AIDS to name a few--increasingly are seen as treatable, survivable, even curable ailments. Yet, despite unprecedented knowledge gained in just the past three decades about the brain and human  behavior, mental health is often an afterthought and illnesses of the mind remain shrouded in fear and misunderstanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much remains to be learned about the causes, treatment, and prevention of mental and behavioral disorders. Obstacles that may limit the availability or accessibility of mental health services for some Americans are being dismantled, but disparities persist. Still, thanks to research and the experiences of millions of individuals who have a mental disorder, their family members, and other advocates, the Nation has the power today to tear down the most formidable obstacle to future progress in  the arena of mental illness and health. That obstacle is stigma. Stigmatization of mental illness is an excuse for inaction and discrimination that is inexcusably outmoded in 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The burden of mental illness on health and productivity in the United States and throughout the world has long been profoundly underestimated. Data developed by the massive Global Burden of Disease study, conducted by the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and Harvard University, reveal that mental illness, including suicide, ranks second in the burden of disease in established market economies, such as the United States. Mental illness emerged from the Global Burden of Disease study  as a surprisingly significant contributor to the burden of disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mental illness is the term that refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders. Mental disorders are health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior--or some combination thereof--associated with distress  and/or impaired functioning. Alzheimer's disease exemplifies a mental disorder largely marked by alterations in thinking, especially forgetting. Depression exemplifies a mental disorder largely marked by alterations in mood. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder exemplifies a mental disorder largely marked by alterations in behavior, over activity, and/or thinking, inability to concentrate. Alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior contribute to a host of problems--patient distress, impaired  functioning, or heightened risk of death, pain, disability, or loss of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Suicide is a major, preventable public health problem. In 2004, it was the eleventh leading cause of death in the U.S., accounting for 32,439 deaths. The overall rate was 10.9 suicide deaths per 100,000 people. An estimated eight to 25 attempted suicides occur per every suicide death. Suicidal behavior is complex. Some risk factors vary with age, gender, or ethnic group and may occur in combination or change over time. Older Americans are disproportionately likely to die by suicide. Of every  100,000 people ages 65 and older, 14.3 died by suicide in 2004. This figure is higher than the national average of 10.9 suicides per 100,000 people in the general population. Non-Hispanic white men age 85 or older had an even higher rate, with 17.8 suicide deaths per 100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are very high among veterans from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to suicide rates even higher than combat deaths. Since October 2001 in Iraq and Afghanistan wars fought about 1.6 million U.S. soldiers, about 4500 of them died, according to Defense Department. The Rand study has found that 20 percent of returning U.S. soldiers suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, but only half of them get treatment. Comparing these figures  it becomes clear that troops suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder complications more than from actual war. Soldiers with combat traumas are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Of these troops 53 percent have received mental care during the last few years,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support the goals and ideals of Mental Health Month in order to emphasize scientific facts and findings regarding mental health and to remove the stigma associated. I recognize that mental well-being is equally as important as physical well-being for our citizens, our communities, our businesses, our economy, and our Nation. I encourage all organizations and health practitioners to use Mental Health Month as an opportunity to promote mental well-being and awareness, ensure access  to appropriate services, and support overall quality of life for those with mental illness.</paragraph>
