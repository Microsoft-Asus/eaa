  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is day 45, that is, 45 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That's $18.5 million a day not able to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has been done for months and the President has already agreed to sign it. Now Veterans Day has come and gone, and the Democrat leadership continues to delay this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am calling on the Speaker to not adjourn for Thanksgiving until this bill has been sent to the President. And I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives and tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean Veterans appropriation bill to the President now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we celebrate a holiday with our families, knowing that there are benefits our veterans don't have access to simply because of our inaction.</paragraph>
