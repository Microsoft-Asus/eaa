    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is day 40. That is 40 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That is $18.5 million a day not able to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that our veterans asked for is that we pass our bill by October 1. This work has been done for months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Veterans Day quickly approaching, the Democratic leadership put our veterans aside to consider billions in bloated domestic spending instead of sending a clean veterans bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm standing with our veterans, and I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives to tell the Democrat leadership to send a clean veterans appropriation bill to the President now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
