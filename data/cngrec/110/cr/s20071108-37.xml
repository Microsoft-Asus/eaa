  <narrative>CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS -- (Senate - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14188">S14188</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as Congress continues to work on comprehensive energy legislation, I want to discuss the importance to my constituents of enacting strong yet achievable corporate average fuel economy standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final energy package needs to increase vehicle fuel economy requirements, but it should do so without undercutting hardworking families in Wisconsin and across the country. Between manufacturing, dealerships, and the automotive parts industry, there are upwards of 50,000 auto jobs in Wisconsin. Having grown up in Janesville--home to a General Motors plant--I understand how important the auto industry is to the State's economy and its communities. For far too long, under different administrations  and different Congresses, the U.S. has pursued trade and other policies that have undermined our country's manufacturing base. Now, it is time to pay attention to the concerns of America's workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can have strong and achievable CAFE standards. However, this will require several reasonable revisions to the Energy bill that the Senate passed. For starters, separate standards for cars and trucks need to be maintained. I recently organized a coalition of senators to write the Senate's Democratic leadership and urge it to maintain the distinction in current law between standards for cars and trucks. Passenger cars and light-duty trucks are inherently different. They should have  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="14189">S14189</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to ensure the Energy bill takes the right approach on CAFE standards, I have also joined colleagues in calling for a formal House-Senate conference to meet to draft the final bill. We should not abandon the normal legislative process on such an important issue and resort to informal, backroom dealmaking. I understand that there are still objections to convening a conference and I hope that those will be resolved soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Senate considered the Energy bill, I have worked to ensure that the final version includes a CAFE standard that supports working families in Janesville and elsewhere. When the Senate considered the bill earlier this year, I supported the reasonable Pryor-Bond-Levin amendment to increase CAFE standards, and I was disappointed that it was never brought to a vote. I continue to work with them and other colleagues to make sure that Congress strikes the right balance on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Congress works to finalize its comprehensive energy legislation, I urge my colleagues to help set strong yet achievable vehicle fuel economy requirements. We can increase CAFE standards while also ensuring that my hometown of Janesville--and hometowns like it across the country--still has the family-supporting jobs that are vital to the strength of the community.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="NATIONAL RADIATION PROTECTION PROFESSIONALS WEEK">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the members of the radiation protection profession and to recognize that the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors and the Health Physics Society have resolved that November 4-10, 2007, should be named National Radiation Protection Professionals Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of x-rays on November 8, 1895, the use of radiation has become vital in the Nation's health care, defense, security, energy, and industrial programs. However, if misused, this vital technology can harm and injure those using it or benefiting from it. Members of the radiation protection profession make it their life's work to allow government, medicine, academia, and industry to safely use radiation. By providing the necessary leadership, these professionals  protect people from radiation hazards thus enabling society to reap benefits of this remarkable technology. I encourage all citizens to recognize the valuable resource represented by their professional scientific organizations, such as the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, the Health Physics, the National Registry</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that both of their resolutions be printed in the Record at this time.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
