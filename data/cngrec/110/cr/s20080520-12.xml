  <chair>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="496">S. Res. 496</bill>) honoring the 60th anniversary of the commencement of the carving of the Crazy Horse Memorial.</chair>
  <chair>The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. On June 3, 2008, the Crazy Horse Memorial will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its dedication. Gutzon Borglum, who was the sculptor behind Mount Rushmore, brought Korczak Ziolkowski to South Dakota to work on Mount Rushmore. It was during construction of Mount Rushmore when Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear contacted Korczak Ziolkowski and stated "My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man  to know the red man has great heroes, too." It is believed that this statement led Mr. Ziolkowski to construct this memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 3, 1948, this memorial was dedicated and construction has continued ever since. Mr. Ziolkowski worked on this memorial until the conclusion of his own life in 1982, when his wife, Ruth, took up the job that her husband began. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation was established and runs entirely on gifts and donations. No government funds have ever been used for construction of this memorial. With no way to predict when completion of this memorial will take place due to cost and weather,  construction continues. When it is completed, however, it will be the largest carving on earth, measuring some 641 feet long by 563 feet high. To put that in perspective, it is said that all four heads on Mount Rushmore could fit into Crazy Horse's head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I wish to honor Korczak Ziolkowski, his wife, and their family for their continued work on this monument. In addition, I would like to honor those involved with the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation. Most importantly, I wish to honor the memory of the great Lakota warrior to whom this memorial is dedicated, Crazy Horse, as well as all Lakota people for their great many contributions to our history and culture in South Dakota. It is they that this memorial is to honor.</paragraph>

  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who never received any formal art training but nonetheless won 1st place for sculpture at the New York World's Fair in 1939, came to the Black Hills of South Dakota as an assistant to Gutzon Borglum to help carve Mount Rushmore;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear contacted Korczak Ziolkowski in 1939 to encourage him to create another mountain memorial, saying in his letter of invitation: "My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Crazy Horse was remembered by his people as a fierce warrior and visionary leader who was committed to preserving the traditional Lakota way of life;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was inspired to honor the culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American Indians, and thus designed a metaphoric tribute to the spirit of Crazy Horse and his people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was dedicated as well to helping his country preserve freedom, enlisted in the Army, and was wounded in 1944 at Omaha Beach;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski returned to South Dakota after World War II in order to find a suitable mountain to carve in order to honor Crazy Horse and his people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Standing Bear dedicated the Crazy Horse Memorial on June 3, 1948;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski worked until his death in 1982, and his wife, Ruth, and their family have dedicated their lives to carving the mountain and continuing the mission of the Crazy Horse Memorial;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there is no way to predict when the mountain carving will be completed, owing to the uncertainty of weather, the availability of private funding, and the challenges of mountain engineering;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, when completed, the Crazy Horse mountain carving will be the largest carving in the world, at 641 feet long by 563 feet high;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski's parting words to his wife were, "You must work on the mountain--but go slowly so you do it right";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Ziolkowski family and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation have continued to do it right, have proceeded without government financial support, and remain dedicated to making steady progress on the Memorial's humanitarian goals; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the dedication of the mountain carving on June 3, 2008: Now, therefore, be it</chair>
  <chair> Resolved, That the Senate, on the 60th anniversary of the commencement of the mountain carving of the Crazy Horse Memorial, honors sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, the Ziolkowski family, and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation for their dedication to honoring the culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American Indians and the spirit of Crazy Horse and his people.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the resolution that was adopted by the Senate is <bill type="sr" number="496">S. Res. 496</bill>, which I introduced on April 2, 2008, along with my colleague from South Dakota, Senator TIM JOHNSON. The resolution honors the 60th anniversary of the Crazy Horse Memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Crazy Horse Memorial, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, honors the culture, the tradition, and the living heritage of Native Americans. Once completed, the memorial will stand more than 22 stories high and be the largest mountain sculpture in the world. Every year, there is an event called the Volksmarch, in which people start at the base and walk up to the very top of the monument. You cannot appreciate the size and the dimension of this great monument from  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="4428">S4428</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sculptor of this monument, Korczak Ziolkowski, had no formal training and originally came to South Dakota to assist Gutzon Borglum in the carving of Mount Rushmore. In 1939, Chief Henry Standing Bear invited him to construct another mountain monument, this one to honor a great Native American hero. However, it was not until June 3, in 1948, that the project was officially dedicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crazy Horse, a great Lakota chief, was selected as the Native American hero worthy of the mountain monument because of his courage in battle, his visionary leadership, and his commitment to the preservation of the traditional Lakota way of life. The memorial was placed in the Black Hills of South Dakota because they are sacred to the Lakota people. While Crazy Horse was never photographed, the completed monument will feature a likeness of him riding a horse and pointing with his left hand out  toward the Black Hills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ziolkowski, who worked tirelessly and without salary on the Crazy Horse Memorial until his death in 1982, believed in individual initiative and private enterprise and worked to build the memorial without any Federal funding. As my colleagues can see from the photo we have here, the face of Crazy Horse is complete, the rest of the mountain has been roughly blocked out, and efforts are currently focused on carving the horse's head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is no way to predict the date of completion because of weather, financing, and the challenges of carving a mountain, Ziolkowski's wife Ruth, who is an amazingly determined woman, and his family, along with the help of thousands of donors and visitors, continues Ziolkowski's mission of honoring Native Americans through the construction of this monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, today I rise to honor the 60th anniversary of the Crazy Horse Memorial and send my best wishes to all those working to make Korczak Ziolkowski's vision a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senate for its adoption of the resolution, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Republican whip is recognized.</chair>
