  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the skyrocketing price of health care continues to be a major concern for millions of Americans. Skyrocketing costs are causing the number of uninsured Americans to increase by 1 million people every year since the President took office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, during his State of the Union Address, the President promised his administration would "confront the rising cost of health care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need." The President did not live up to his promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the President can no longer afford to provide lip service on health care. The proposal that the President will unveil tonight will do nothing to lower health care costs, nor will it provide health insurance to more Americans. He should reject this proposal and instead work with this Democratic Congress to help come up with real health care solutions.</paragraph>
