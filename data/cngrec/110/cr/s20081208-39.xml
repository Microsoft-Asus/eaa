    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a resolution recognizing January 2 as National Advertising Specialty Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An advertising specialty is any item imprinted with a logo or slogan and given out to promote a company, organization, product, service, special achievement or event. The use of advertising specialties has historical relevance as the industry dates back to George Washington's use of collectible buttons in his presidential campaign in 1789. Today, there are over 750,000 varieties of advertising specialties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The advertising specialty industry is now a major contributor to the United States economy. The industry employs over 344,000 professionals, including 9,000 in Pennsylvania. Eighty-five percent of these professionals are employed in small or medium-size businesses, some of which gross up to one million dollars per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The advertising specialty industry has experienced substantial growth. It has grown annually at an average rate of 4 percent since 2003 making it a 19.6 billion dollar industry in 2007. Advertising specialties now account for over 14 percent of all tracked advertising spending in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to recognize the positive contributions the advertising specialty industry has had on the economy by creating jobs and small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support this industry by designating January 2 as National Advertising Specialty Day.</paragraph>
