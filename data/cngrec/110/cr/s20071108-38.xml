    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jack and Lola Bradley who will celebrate the 70th anniversary of their wedding during Thanksgiving week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 20, 1937, Jack Bradley and Lola Davis made a commitment to one another to become lifelong partners. True to their word, they have remained as husband and wife for 70 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack met Lola in Cheyenne, WY, while they were students at Cheyenne High School. The story goes that it was love at first sight. The couple maintained their relationship while Jack went to the University of Wyoming and Lola finished up her high school education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They started their lives together by moving to Newcastle, WY, to run the family business, Manewal Bradley Refinery--and they remain active in the operation today. They raised three children: Linda, Jack and Lolly. Jack and Lola are respected members of the community. They've supported local charities, they donated land for a city park, and even allowed the use of their property for a community baseball diamond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every candidate for public office in Wyoming knows Jack and Lola. They are the go-to people in Weston County. During campaign season, Jack and Lola continue to provide advice, support, and time to candidates at all levels of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the challenges of running a business, raising a family, and serving their community, it was the undying love for each other that made such a strong relationship that it would last well into the 21st century. I am pleased to take this moment to express my congratulations to Jack and Lola and join with their family and friends in wishing them the very best in the years to come.</paragraph>
