    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with disappointment that I rise today. It is disappointment over the fact that this body still has not brought to the floor the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Protect America Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard the colloquy that has taken place on this floor this afternoon. We know that a bipartisan solution to this was passed in the Senate with 68 votes. We also know looking at our calendar that obviously the issue is not about time. The issue is about having the will to pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Protect America Act has expired. We are now under the old surveillance laws that were written in 1978. The intelligence community has expressed their desire to see this passed because they know that they are having to waste valuable time working on bureaucratic red tape and legal paperwork and dealing with trial lawyers, instead of spying on terrorists who seek to do us harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would encourage the majority to bring forward the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Let's work to keep America safe.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
