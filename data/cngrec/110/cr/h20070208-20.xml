    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is becoming ever more clear that the troop escalation plan proposed by the administration is not--is not--in our Nation's best interest or in the best interest of bringing stability to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, three different events demonstrated why it is absolutely essential that Congress accept its responsibility to debate the President's plan. First, the cost of the escalation: The President has advertised it to be $5.6 billion; CBO, nonpartisan, estimates it will be $21 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the number of troops required, the President is selling it, advertising it as requiring 21,600 troops. CBO estimates suggest that it will be at least 48,000 troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, Pentagon officials admitted last week that they do not have enough armored vehicles, armored kits and other equipment that is absolutely essential to protecting the well-being of our troops. We cannot be sending troops into battle without the equipment and the protection that they need.</paragraph>
