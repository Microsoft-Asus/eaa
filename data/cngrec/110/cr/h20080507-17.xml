  <narrative>WE NEED TO STOP THE WHINING -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3113]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's interesting to come down here and to listen to the majority party, the Democrats, talk about a new change in direction for our energy policy or something new to do about our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>News flash: Y'all are in charge. You've got 230-plus votes. You're in charge. You can pass anything you want to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to stop the whining. Since they took over in 2007, with a new energy policy, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, our gasoline has gone up about $1.50 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here's what I want everybody to do, Mr. Speaker. I want you to go home tonight and I want you to go to Home Depot and I want you to buy some energy saving bulbs because, in their energy bill, light bulbs are mentioned 350 times, where gasoline was mentioned 6, crude oil was mentioned 12. I want you to go home, I want you to take those energy saving light bulbs, I want you to put them in, and then I want you to drive to the gas station and see if gas has come down, because that's the way their  plan is supposed to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You're in charge. If you're in charge, lead. Mr. Speaker, we need some leadership here. We need to do something to help the American people at the gas pump with these outrageous gasoline prices and crude oil fixing to go to $150-plus a barrel. Do something.</paragraph>
