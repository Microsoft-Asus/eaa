  <narrative>END THE UNJUST IMPRISONMENT OF U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS COMPEAN AND RAMOS -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3755]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is day 482 of a terrible injustice in America. Two U.S. Border Patrol agents have been in Federal prison in solitary confinement since January 17 of 2007. Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting an illegal alien drug smuggler from Mexico. The smuggler brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our borders into Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prosecution's star witness, the illegal alien drug smuggler, recently  pled guilty to four felony counts for smuggling drugs while under immunity to testify against the border agents. Ramos and Compean were doing their job to protect America and to protect our border. Yet through a questionable prosecution, the agents were convicted and sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison, respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the efforts of the American people and Members of Congress in both parties, nothing has been done to reverse this injustice. Members of Congress and outside groups have filed court briefs to support these agents, and on December 3, 2007, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard oral arguments for their appeals. The only glimmer of hope for these agents and their families rest with the Fifth Circuit Court's decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have not forgotten Ramos and Compean. The more time these men spend behind bars, the longer it takes for a decision on their appeal, the more frustrated the American people become, Madam Speaker, as millions of Americans eagerly await a ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court. My prayers are with the agents and their families. I hope that the judges' decision will rectify this gross miscarriage of justice and faith in our judicial system may be restored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Congressman Rohrabacher for calling for a national day of prayer last Sunday on behalf of these two decorated U.S. Border Patrol agents. In addition to Mother's Day, this past Sunday marked the beginning of National Police Week. This week is a fitting time for the American people to join in prayer not only for agents Ramos and Compean, but for all men and women in uniform who risk their lives each day to protect our communities. Agents Ramos and Compean were willing to risk their  lives to defend our border and protect America from illegal drug smugglers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, before I close, again, we call on this White House to please listen to the pleas of the American people and the Congress to say let these men go for doing their job to protect the American people from a drug smuggler. I pray that justice will finally prevail for these men and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Madam Speaker, again, I call on this White House to listen to the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
