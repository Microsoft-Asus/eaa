    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on the House Concurrent Resolution, <bill type="hc" number="325">H. Con. Res. 325</bill>, which was introduced by Congressman Stupak and recognizes the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission's Historical Preservation and Museum Program. This anniversary, which will take place on June 15, 2008, honors the work of the Commission to protect, preserve, and communicate the rich history and natural wonders of Mackinac Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in the heart of the Great Lakes, between Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas, Mackinac Island is an important part of this Nation's history. In colonial years, the island provided strategic fur-trading posts for French, British, and American settlements. During the Civil War, Britain's Fort Mackinac was established on this island and the fort was also used during the War of 1812. In 1817, the village of Mackinac was incorporated and served as the seat for the territorial county of Michilimackinac,  which covered much of what is now Michigan. It also functioned as the seat of Mackinac County from 1849 through 1882. The island was considered a sacred place to Native Americans and functioned as a tribal gathering place and burial site. Today, the island is a popular tourism destination where people can relax, enjoy nature, and learn about history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception in 1895, the Mackinac Island State Park Commission has been actively engaged in a variety of  restoration activities and has worked to interpret and communicate the multiple stories of this important island to millions of visitors. The Commission has participated in a number of initiatives, including archeological excavation, lighthouse restoration, and exhibit installation, to protect and manage the historic resources of the park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Congress recognized the significance of Mackinac when it established the Mackinac Island National Park in 1875, making it the Nation's second National Park after Yellowstone. In 1895, park ownership was transferred to the State of Michigan, creating Michigan's first State park. In 1958, the Mackinac Island State Park Commission established the Historical Preservation and Museum Program. This program has served as the primary caretaker and purveyor of the Island's considerable tale. I  am pleased to extend my warmest congratulations to those individuals involved with this program who have painstakingly restored and preserved Mackinac Island for future generations.</paragraph>
