    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session, that the Agriculture Committee be discharged of PN 1112, the nomination of Ed Schafer, to be Secretary of Agriculture; that the Senate proceed to the nomination, that the nomination be confirmed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate return to legislative session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding is this was cleared on both sides. I am particularly proud to make this request. Former Governor Schafer is a distinguished former Governor from our State. It is a great honor for our State to have him nominated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I wish to join with the Senator from North Dakota, who is doing a fine thing. We appreciate the support on both sides of the aisle. We obviously need a good and strong Secretary of Agriculture, and we are pleased to see this body move forward. I do not object. I thank the sponsors.</paragraph>
