  <narrative>TIME FOR ORDERLY EXIT FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10326]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since the President's escalation of the war in Iraq began, every month we have had more and more proud, dedicated people from Fort Lewis, Washington, and their families learn they were never coming home. Those men and women have been fed into Iraq by a President whose policies in Iraq were wrong at the beginning, were wrong in the middle, and will be wrong at the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is very clear from all of the reports that we have been reading in the last week: whether we stay 6 days or 6 weeks or 6 months or 60 years, the destiny of Iraq will be determined by the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what we have learned in this escalation is that it failed; it has failed to accomplish its design of political reconciliation in Iraq. And until the Sunnis and Shiites reconcile their interests, all of the king's horses and all the king's men are not going to put Iraq together again. It is time for an orderly exit from Iraq.</paragraph>
