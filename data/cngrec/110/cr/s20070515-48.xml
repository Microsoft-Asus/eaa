    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, let me express my appreciation to the Presiding Officer, for you and all the staff. I am sorry things take so long. Believe me, I wish we would have done it more quickly myself. Sometimes you can't. It takes a lot of phone calls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have reminded people, much of what we do in the Senate is done with unanimous consent. That means all Senators have to agree, and there are 100 of us. Senator McConnell and I have been making phone calls to see if we can get this resolved, and I think we are at the point we need to be now. So thank you very much, everybody.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Presiding Officer is very happy to be here.</chair>
