  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the minority leader for their nice words. They might disagree on certain issues, but I am glad they agree on one thing--that I finally made it to the U.S. Senate after spending 12 years in the House and did have a private and professional life prior to service here in the Federal Government. I thank both Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we prepare to discuss the war in Iraq, I would like to take a couple of minutes to discuss the issue of personal responsibility, civility, and the role of American diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the founding of our great Nation, we have had a long and proud tradition of international diplomacy. Our diplomacy has taken many forms, whether it is through official state visits or through less formal channels, such as congressional delegations traveling to individual countries. What we all need to remember is that when we are on a trip to a foreign country, we act as American diplomats. This is something which I would like my colleagues to remember, especially when  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="1471">S1471</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We currently face a critical turning point in our Nation's foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As representatives of this Government, we need to be responsible with our remarks on foreign soil and to show some form of civility when airing our grievances about our President, our country's stand on diplomatic issues, and the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we do have our disagreements on how this country should proceed, I believe we need to iron out these problems at home rather than taking them to an international stage and using that opportunity to make politically offensive comments towards our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saying our country is shameful at an international forum only hurts our standing among world leaders we are trying to negotiate with on important trade deals and other foreign policy issues such as preventing further international conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to help build up America on the international stage, not shoot ourselves in the foot by tearing ourselves down with statements used for political gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans do not belong to the "Blame America First" crowd. Most Americans don't support bashing our country on the international stage. Most Americans agree that politics ends at the water's edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Blame America First" crowd spreads negative sentiment about the United States, and then wonders why the rest of the world has a low opinion of America. They are feeding the very beast they claim they are trying to tame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans are proud of what this country stands for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States is one of the largest contributors in economic aid to developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We continually work as a Nation to extend a helping hand to those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding for bilateral and economic assistance has increased consecutively over the past 6 years, reaching unprecedented levels in the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also taken the lead in the fight against the spread of HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recognize that this pandemic is destroying lives, undermining economies, and threatening to destabilize entire regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's emergency plan for AIDS relief is the largest commitment ever made by any nation to combat HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of people benefiting from this program has grown from 50,000 to 800,000 in 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an extremely successful program and continues to grow in support every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also continue to provide lifesaving drugs to fight malaria to those in need in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the President's malaria initiative we have been able to provide millions of lifesaving treatments in order to prevent the spread of this debilitating disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These international successes often go largely unnoticed and are overshadowed by the current debate on the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to take a moment this week to reflect upon our foreign policy successes as well as our current challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we can build upon our mistakes and learn from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must work collectively on advancing our national interests instead of splintering off and playing into the hands of our enemies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the proposed resolutions on Iraq send a terrible message to both our troops and allies and only hurt our national interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more importantly, I believe they send a dangerous message to our enemies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not support these kinds of nonbinding resolutions that criticize our plans for Iraq and I plan to oppose them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are counterproductive and will not make our problems in Iraq go away now or in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support working to find real solutions to the problem at hand, not politically motivated attempts that offer little or no alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not participate in this empty political posturing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My main focus is on providing moral and material support for our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not forget our commitment to our troops and in turn the commitment they made to our country and the mission in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe they deserve our full support, not criticism and idle threats to cut their funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of my colleagues, I was initially skeptical of sending additional reinforcement troops to Iraq, but I believe that we must give the President's new strategy a chance to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abruptly cutting and running is not a viable option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would only further hinder our efforts in the war on terror and endanger our regional allies in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will support our commander and chief in his new way forward in Iraq and will support General Petraeus, our new commander of the multinational forces in Iraq, in his efforts to carry out this plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that General Petraeus is a key component in this new strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has spent many years of his fine career stationed at Fort Campbell, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the utmost respect for him and confidence in his leadership skills and judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His service in Iraq has equipped him with an expertise in irregular warfare and operations and a true understanding of the enemy we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his 27 months in Iraq, he led a division into battle, oversaw the reconstruction and governance of Iraq's third-largest city, and built up from virtually nothing Iraq's army and police force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He managed to do this all by earning the respect of the Iraqis--all Iraqis--the Kurds, Sunnis and the Shias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Petraeus and I talked, just the two of us, for nearly an hour in my office this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked tough questions. And he responded with realistic answers about what it takes for us to succeed in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He knows that Iraqis have to live up to their end of the bargain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we must show General Petraeus that we will live up to our end of the bargain and give him the opportunity to carry out his mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of our colleagues support General Petraeus but do not support his mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our colleagues that unanimously voted to give General Petraeus his fourth star last week will likely vote in favor of proposed resolutions that question the very mission that General Petraeus testified in support of before the Senate Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This does not make sense to me. Right now we cannot afford to distinguish between the two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not asking my colleagues for an open-ended commitment, just a little more patience--patience to see if this new strategy works, patience to see if Iraqis will hold up their end of the bargain and meet the benchmarks set by both our countries, and finally, patience to allow our troops to complete their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops are committed to their mission. Now we owe them our commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is our last best hope for progress in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Petraeus offered to provide Congress with regular reports on the progress of his mission and on the performance and cooperation of Iraqis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I plan on taking him up on this offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must keep up to date on the situation in Iraq as it changes so that we can best help our new commander address the situation at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish General Petraeus the best of luck in this mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a daunting task but I have faith in him and his leadership capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must show a united front and give this plan a chance to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of failure is too great. We cannot afford failure in Iraq and the international community cannot either, so I ask my colleagues to reflect on these serious issues before we begin debating the resolutions concerning the war in Iraq next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us show both our allies and our enemies that we can be united behind our Nation's foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Arizona.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first let me compliment my colleague, Senator Bunning, for a fine statement. I endorse his call for unity. In a time of war, a country needs to be unified, especially when we send our young men and women into harm's way. They need to know we support the mission that we put them in harm's way to try to achieve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember years ago I used to see bumper stickers that said, "Give peace a chance." Today we need to dust off some of those bumper stickers, write a couple of extra words in, and give the President's plan for peace a chance. We are going to have a debate next week among those who believe the President's plan deserves a chance to succeed and those who disagree. I believe the latter position is dangerous, and it would be dangerous to express that point of view with a vote of the Senate in support  of a resolution to that effect, especially since it appears people whom we have relied on in the past for advice are also now saying give the President's plan a chance and because events on the ground are beginning to suggest that his plan is already beginning to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a great deal of discussion about the Baker-Hamilton report. Critics of the President's plan have frequently held that report up as evidence that we need to take a different course of action. But yesterday, appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former Secretary of State James Baker and former Member of the House of Representatives Lee Hamilton both argued that the President's plan should be given a chance to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe that surprised the chairman, but here is what they testified. Representative Hamilton:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I guess my bottom line on the surge is, look, the President's plan ought to be given a chance. Give it a chance, because we heard all of this. The general that you confirmed 80-to-nothing the day before yesterday, this is his idea. He's the supporter of it. Give it a chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is Lee Hamilton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Senator and Secretary of State Baker said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... the study group set no timetables and we set no deadlines. We believe that military commanders must have the flexibility to respond to events on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he said, in response to a Senator:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator, one of the purposes of the surge, as I'm sure you have heard from General Petraeus, when you confirmed him, is to give the Iraqi government a little more running room in order to help it achieve national reconciliation by tamping down the violence or pacifying, if you will, Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the purpose of this strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, there is already evidence, even though the strategy has certainly not been implemented in full, that even the prospect of its implementation is beginning to have an effect. It is clear the Iraqi Government, in its pronouncements, has already begun to sound a lot different to these terrorists than they did in the past, when the Iraqi Government didn't always back up the U.S. efforts. When we would go into an area, we would capture these killers, and a couple of days later they would  be back on the street because somebody with political influence in Iraq would see that it happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea is the Iraqis are now going to take charge and not allow that to happen. And in addition to U.S. troops, there will be twice as many new Iraqi troops helping to make sure it does not happen. Here are a few excerpts from the news media.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Washington Post, February 1, 2007:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shiite militia leaders already appear to be leaving their strongholds in Baghdad in anticipation of the U.S. and Iraqi plan to increase the troop presence in the Iraqi capital, according to the top U.S. commander in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen numerous indications Shia militia leaders will leave, or already have left, Sadr City to avoid capture by Iraqi and coalition security forces," Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr. said in a written statement submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation hearing today to be the Army chief of staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already beginning to work. The article continues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Radical Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr has ordered his militia not to confront U.S. forces and has endorsed negotiations aimed at easing the deployment of American troops in his strongholds, according to Sadrist and other Shiite officials.  This is the idea. In Anbar Province, where the pressure from al-Qaida has been very strong, there is now news that the sheiks in Anbar Province are beginning to work with us. Just one report from the Washington Post of January 27:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the help of a confederation of about 50 Sunni Muslim tribal sheiks, the U.S. military recruited more than 800 police officers in December and is on track to do the same this month. Officers credit the sheiks' cooperation for the diminishing violence in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have just mounted a big offensive with the Iraqi military in Najaf, and I quote from a Washington Post story of January 29:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraqi soldiers, backed by U.S. helicopters, stormed an encampment of hundreds of insurgents hiding among date palm orchards in southern Iraq in an operation Sunday and set off fierce, day-long gun battles during the holiest week for the country's Shiite Muslims. Iraqi security officials said that the troops killed scores of insurgents while foiling a plot to annihilate the Shiite religious leadership in the revered city of Najaf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also political movement in the country. Let me quote from a story from the Los Angeles Times of February 1:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sunni and Shiite Arab lawmakers announced plans Wednesday to form two new blocs in Iraq's parliament they hope will break away from the ethnic and religious mold of current alliances and ease sectarian strife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has also been a lot of talk about whether the mission of our forces should be one of which is to help secure the borders. This is something else that the Iraqis have pledged that they need to do, particularly in their relationships with Syria and Iran. Quoting from the same Los Angeles Times story:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq indefinitely halted all flights to and from Syria and closed a border crossing with Iran as the government prepares for a security crackdown, a parliament member and an airport official said Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. The airport official said that flights to and from Syria would be cancelled for at least two weeks and that service had been interrupted on Tuesday. Hassan al-Sunneid, a member of the parliament's defense and security committee, told the AP that "the move was  in preparation for the security plan. The State will decide when the flights will resume."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is already beginning. No resolution passed here in the Senate is going to stop this new strategy. It appears to already be having some success. My only concern is the disagreement of some of our colleagues that it can't succeed will become a self-fulfilling prophecy, merely because it could embolden our enemies and cause our allies to wonder whether we still have the will to continue until we have achieved our mission in Iraq. But perhaps the message I am most concerned about that these  resolutions would send is not only to the enemy and to our allies, but to our own troops and to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been quite a bit of discussion of a news report on the NBC Nightly News last Friday, Brian Williams reporting, who specifically called upon Richard Engel, who was in Iraq, to report on what he had found there. I will work through his report, but here is what Engel said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not just the new mission the soldiers are adjusting to. They have something else on their minds: The growing debate at home about the war. Troops here say they are increasingly frustrated by American criticism of the war. Many take it personally, believing it is also criticism of what they have been fighting for. Twenty-one year-old SP Tyler Johnson is on his first tour in Iraq. He thinks skeptics should come over and see what it is like firsthand before criticizing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what SP Tyler Johnson then said on the TV news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those people are dying. You know what I'm saying? You may support--"Oh, we support the troops," but you're not supporting what they do, what they share and sweat for, what they believe for, and what we die for. It just don't make sense to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard Engel then said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff SGT Manuel Sahagun has served in Afghanistan and is now on his second tour in Iraq. He says people back home can't have it both ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now Staff SGT Manuel Sahagun is on the camera and says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I don't like is when people back home say they support the troops, but they don't support the war. If they're going to support us, support us all the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then Engel says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SP Peter Manna thinks people have forgotten the toll the war has taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And SP Peter Manna says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they don't think what we are doing is a good job, everything that we have done here is all in vain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Engel concludes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apache Company has lost two soldiers and now worries their country may be abandoning the mission they died for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot send that message to our troops and to their families, that we disagree with the mission we are putting them in harm's way to try to achieve. As these three young men, our finest, have said, speaking to the American people: You can't say you support the troops if you don't support what we are trying to do here, what we might die trying to accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why we have to be careful about resolutions in the Senate. Every Senator has an immense capability of expressing his or her point of view. We have all done that. We all continue to do it. We can get before the cameras any time we want to. We can let our folks back home know what we feel. And I dare say there are probably 100 different opinions in this body of 100 people. We all have a little different view of it. And we can tell our constituents what we think.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We certainly can communicate that to the President and people in the military. What we don't have to do is to go the next step and pass a resolution that first of all is nonbinding and has no effect on the implementation of the strategy, which is already beginning and will go forward, but can have a very detrimental effect on our enemies, on our allies, and on our own troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When General Petraeus was here testifying before his confirmation, he was asked a question about the resolutions to the effect of would it be helpful, and he said: No, it would not be helpful. Then he went on to talk about the object of war being to break the will of the enemy. He said: This would not help us--it would hurt us--break the will of the enemy, especially in a war like the one we  are fighting with terrorists around the globe today--a war of wills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important for us not to send the signal that our will is flagging, that there is great disagreement in our country about the desire to continue. In this war of wills, we should be unified and in support of the mission we are sending our troops to try to accomplish, and in support of the general whom we have confirmed to carry out that mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope my colleagues will think very carefully about the words they speak, the actions they take, and reflect on what others will think of what we do here in this body. We are not simply speaking to the President, trying to send him a message. Everyone else in the world will get that message. And as much as we might manipulate the words in a resolution to try to bring 60 Senators all in consensus to what the resolution says, we all know what the headlines the next morning are going to say  all around the world if a resolution like this were to pass: "Senate Declares No Confidence in President's Strategy." "U.S. Senate Goes on Record as Opposing Bush Plan." You can write the headline. Those are the words that will resonate around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not make any criticism of the President or his plan become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Let's be as united as we can in supporting our troops by supporting the mission we are sending them on, hoping it will succeed; if we want, expressing concerns we have about that, but doing so in a way that doesn't undercut the message. We can do both of these things in this great open society. People expect us to have debate about important issues such as matters of war and peace, and we can do that  without undercutting the mission here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I go back to where I started in quoting former Representative Lee Hamilton, cochairman of the Hamilton-Baker commission in his testimony yesterday here in the Senate:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I guess my bottom line on the surge is, look, the President's plan ought to be given a chance. Give it a chance, because we have heard all of this. The general that you confirmed 80 to nothing the day before yesterday, this is his idea. He's the supporter of it. Give it a chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
