  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my thoughts on the Department of Housing and Urban Development fiscal year 2008 budget. In my opinion, it is disgraceful. This budget cuts vital housing assistance programs, leaving low-income families, elderly and the disabled out in the cold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's request cuts the Community Development Block Grant by 20 percent, cuts public housing programs by 7 percent, cuts disabled housing programs by 47 percent, and cuts elderly housing programs by 22 percent. The budget eliminated entirely the HOPE VI housing program, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, the President also cuts the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program by 56 percent. So with both cuts to housing and the heating assistance programs, the President will leave the most vulnerable out in the cold. I hope that this Congress will act with more thought by appropriating more funding for these vital programs.</paragraph>
