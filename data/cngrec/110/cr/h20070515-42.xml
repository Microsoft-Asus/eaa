    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 79 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 66th Annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby to be held on June 16, 2007. The event is open to the public and free of charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is one of the largest qualifying races in the country. The races take place on Constitution Avenue between Delaware Avenue and Third Street, N.W. Participants are residents of the Washington Metropolitan area and range in age from 8 to 17. They compete in three open divisions depending on their level of expertise. The winners of these races will represent the Washington Metropolitan Area at the national finals held annually in Akron, Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Annual Soap Box Derby is a wonderful summer tradition. I support this resolution, which continues our custom of authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for this exciting event, and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader, who is the sponsor of this resolution, one who has constantly put children first.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding and I congratulate him on his leadership of this subcommittee and  his leadership in our State of Maryland. I am proud to be Mr. Cummings' colleague. I also thank the gentlelady from Virginia for her leadership in bringing this matter to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I proudly sponsor this resolution allowing the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold the 66th Annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on the Capitol Grounds on Saturday, June 16.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's tradition of soapbox racing began, Mr. Speaker, as you may know, in 1934, when Myron E. Scott, a photographer for the Dayton Daily News, saw boys racing engineless cars down a hill. This inspired Mr. SCOTT to hold a race and award the winner with a "loving cup."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first year, the race took place in Dayton, Ohio. The following year the race moved to Akron due to the city's numerous hills. With the hard work of countless civic organizations, a permanent track site for the youth racing classic was created with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration, affectionately known as the WPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soapbox derby racing in our Nation's Capital has a long and rich tradition as well. In 1938, Norman Rocca beat out 223 other racers to win the inaugural Greater Washington Soapbox Derby, which was then held on New Hampshire Avenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, thousands of the region's young people have participated in this great race. Although the location has moved from the original site on New Hampshire Avenue to Capitol Hill, the essence of the race has remained the same: homemade gravity-powered cars, the spirit of competition, and the pure joy of racing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The soapbox derby consists of dozens of drivers, both boys and girls, ranging in ages from 8 to 17. These racers are divided into three divisions: stock, superstock and masters. The local winner of each division will automatically qualify to compete with racers from around the world in the 70th All-American Soapbox Derby in Akron, Ohio, on July 26.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The festivities in Akron begin when the racers receive a police escort into town and conclude in the winner's circle with the awarding of scholarships and merchandise. In between, the racers and their families participate in a whirlwind of activities that leave them with enduring friendships and memories that last a lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this event has been called "the greatest amateur racing event in the world," and it is an excellent opportunity for the contestants from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia to learn basic building skills while gaining a real sense of accomplishment and competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage my colleagues to join with me and the other original cosponsors, Representatives Frank Wolf, James Moran, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Al Wynn, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Mr. Cummings and Mrs. Drake, in supporting this resolution, which honors such an extraordinary and in some respects uniquely American event here on Capitol Hill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join the Majority Leader (Mr. Hoyer) and Ms. Norton, along with Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Moran of Virginia, Mr. Wolf, and Mr. Wynn in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 79, to authorize use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. I especially want to acknowledge the dedication of Mr. Hoyer, who faithfully introduces this resolution each year to authorize use of the Capitol Grounds  for this wonderful event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This annual event encourages all boys and girls, ages eight through 17, to construct and operate their own soap box vehicles. The Washington event, which attracts a great number of spectators and extensive media coverage, has grown in size and has become one of the best-attended events in the country. The winner in each of three age divisions wins a trip to the national race in Akron, Ohio. The Washington Soap Box Derby is supported by hundreds of volunteers and parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The principles of aerodynamics are combined with fun and excitement for all participants and their families in the Greater Washington area. It is an excellent opportunity for parents to have direct involvement in their children's activities. The derby's mission is to provide children with an activity that promotes technical and social skills that will serve them throughout their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is scheduled for June 16.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 79.</paragraph>
