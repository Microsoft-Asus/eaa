    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which shares jurisdiction over the SCHIP bill, <bill type="h" number="3162">H.R. 3162</bill>, I would like to express my frustration with the way this bill has been rammed through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January, we had only one hearing on the SCHIP program. We did not have a legislative hearing on <bill type="h" number="3162">H.R. 3162</bill>, which is supposed to be the Democrats' signature piece of health care legislation this Congress, no markup in subcommittee, and it was written in secret with no input from our side of the aisle. In fact, the text of the bill was not even provided to members of the committee until 11:33 the night before the full committee markup was supposed to take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, bringing a bill with over $200 billion in authorized spending to the floor without allowing the bill to go through the proper legislative process is simply poor governance.</paragraph>
