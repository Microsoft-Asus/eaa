    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, imagine my beloved St. Louis Cardinals were playing the much-despised Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals are up by five, finishing the top of the ninth. Is this a cause for celebration? Is this a cause for victory? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unbelievable as it may seem, the Cubbies score five runs in the bottom of the ninth to throw the game into extra innings. There, the score remains until 1 a.m., five innings later. However, at the top of the 15th, the Cardinals fail to field a batter. The entire team has left the stadium. It seems that they are more worried about next day's 1 p.m. game at home than finishing the game at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who wins? We know, it's the team that stays on the field. Arbitrary deadlines and a date certain accept defeat before the conclusion of the contest. It is in our national security interest to continue to take the field and support a moderate Arab state. Leaving prior assures a loss for us and a victory for our opponents, which will lead to another extremist Islamic state.</paragraph>
