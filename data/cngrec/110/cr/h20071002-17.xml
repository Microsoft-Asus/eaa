  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a Member of this Congress which has delivered to the American people real and meaningful change. We are fiscally responsible. We have instituted pay-as-you-go rules and deficit reduction discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where our majority has made real progress is by creating greater opportunity and a chance for prosperity for  all. Already we have reduced the cost on student loans and increased the size of Pell Grant scholarships, and President Bush signed our college affordability bill into law last week. We thank him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We gave millions of Americans a pay raise by increasing the minimum wage and restored government oversight lacking for the last 6 years, saving billions of taxpayer dollars and exposing corruption. These investments, done for all Americans, are a few examples of how this Congress is taking America in a new direction.</paragraph>
