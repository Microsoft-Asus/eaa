  <narrative>JUDGES' HALL OF SHAME--MARILYN MACKEL -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1421]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, judges should keep politics out of their judicial decisions, but not so with California Judge Marilyn Mackel. She is a loud opponent of U.S. liberation of Iraq. So when Shawn Sage, a foster child of 17, appeared before her to obtain permission to early enlist in the United States Marine Corps, she summarily denounced his request and told him she was opposed to the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shawn appeared in court with his supporting foster parents just to be insulted by a judge who makes decisions based on politics. Judge Mackel is a repeat offender, however. Judge "Gone Wild" Mackel has shown prejudice against the military before when she prevented a foster child from joining the United States Navy, all because of a political bias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former judge, it appears to me the abuse of power by this anti-American military, peacenik judge is the perfect example of her having a terminal case of black robe disease, a disease some judges get when their personal politics cloud their judgment. Keep politics and wacky judges out of the courthouse. Judge Mackel is the newest member of the Judges' Hall of Shame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
