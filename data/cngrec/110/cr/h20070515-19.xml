  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to join with millions across this Nation who applaud the Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the ban on partial-birth abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Partial-birth abortion is unrivaled in its gruesome brutality. There is no question it has caused the vicious destruction of viable human life, babies, whose only crime is inconvenience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court's decision is a victory in the quest to restore basic human dignity and human life. No longer will the  most vulnerable and innocent among us be subject to such cruelty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also is a victory for the Constitution, which liberal activist judges have demeaned for far too long. It is encouraging to see the Court's decision move toward our Founders' vision and intent to not only respect opinions and the vision for our country, but also to protect human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us never forget our responsibility to uphold the basic sanctity of human life granted by our Maker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
