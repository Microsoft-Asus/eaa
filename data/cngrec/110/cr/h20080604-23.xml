    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's not working. The policy of "no" to producing America's resources is not working for the American people. Today, America will write a check for $1 billion to buy enough energy to run our economy for one day. Let me repeat that. Today, America will write a check for $1 billion to run our economy for one day. That means for the year, it takes $365 billion to export to other countries that have said "yes" to developing their resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about what we could do with $1 billion if we invested that in developing American resources; the jobs that it would create, the fact it would make America more independent and less dependent on those other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The policy of "no" is not working. We need to say "yes" to producing more of America's resources; "yes" to drilling in areas where we have found abundant resources; "yes" to using a 250-year supply of coal; "yes" to building new nuclear power plants; "yes" to developing America's resources, reinvesting in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask you to bring legislation to the floor that will help America build a stronger energy independence.</paragraph>
