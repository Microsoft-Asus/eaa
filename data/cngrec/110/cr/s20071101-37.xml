    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Leslie K. Osborn for earning Hawaii's first Silver Award in Venturing, the highest award in the Venturing program of the Boy Scouts of America. Leslie will be honored with this award at the annual Aloha Council Eagle Scout Banquet in April of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Venturing was created by the Boy Scouts of America in 1998 to provide positive experiences for young men and women and the tools needed to become responsible and caring adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Involvement in the Boy Scouts of America is a long-standing tradition in the Osborn family. Both Leslie's older brother, Bobby, and her younger sister, Heather, are active in the program. Parents, LTC John and Patricia Osborn, teach their children strong family values and respect for God and country. Leslie is a strong young woman who is motivated by the desire to prove that she has the same capabilities as boys. She spends much of her time building her strength in wilderness survival through  such activities as camping, climbing, and hiking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leslie is also an exceptional student. She has maintained a 4.0 GPA at Kalaheo High School while enjoying hobbies such as dancing jazz and ballet. She is very involved in community services, both on her own time through her work at the Marine Corps commissary and through her activities in the Boy Scouts program. She has participated in numerous community outreach programs, including the annual Toys for Tots program as well as beach cleanups. She plans to attend college with the goal of becoming  a veterinarian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to hearing more about Leslie's successes as she continues to pursue her education and personal goals. Congratulations to her parents John and Patricia, who have raised their daughter to be a remarkable young lady. I wish Leslie and the rest of the Osborn family the very best in their future endeavors.</paragraph>
