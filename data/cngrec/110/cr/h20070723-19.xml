    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1285">H.R. 1285</bill>, introduced by Representative Doc Hastings of Washington, conveys 1.5 acres of land in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest to facilitate the construction of a new fire and rescue station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue is in need of a new fire station as the current station has numerous deficiencies. The fire station is important to the community and often responds to fires on Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is our understanding that there are ongoing discussions in Washington State to address some lingering issues related to this conveyance, and we support those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that understanding, we have no objection to <bill type="h" number="1285">H.R. 1285</bill>, and support its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority has adequately explained the bill. I would like to commend Congressman Doc Hastings and his staff for their work on this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Snoqualmie Pass Land Conveyance Act would transfer an acre and a half of Forest Service land to the King and Kittitas Counties Fire District No. 51--also known as Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue. This land would be conveyed at no cost, but would have to be used by the Fire District specifically for the constructon of a new fire station or it would revert back to the federal government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue serves a portion of two counties on both sides of the Cascade Mountains along Interstate 90. This is a very rural area, with a small number of full-time residents, but it is also the major transportation corridor for goods and services between Eastern and Western Washington, as well as a destination for winter recreation. In recent years, this area has been the scene of major winter snowstorms, multi-vehicle accidents, and even avalanches. The Fire District is  often the first responder to incidents in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, the Fire District has been leasing its current site from the Forest Service. They operate out of an aging building that was never designed to be a fire station. Through their hard work and dedication, they have served their community ably despite this building's many shortcomings. However, with traffic on the rise and the need for emergency services in the area growing, the Fire District needs to move to a true fire station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have identified a nearby site that would better serve the public safety needs of interstate travelers. This location would provide easy access to the interstate in either direction, reducing response times in emergencies. The parcel is on Forest Service property, immediately adjacent to a freeway interchange, between a frontage road and the interstate itself. The parcel was formerly a disposal site during construction of the freeway and is now a gravel lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I acknowledge that the Forest Service does not normally support conveyances of land free of charge. However, I believe an exception should be made in this particular circumstance because of the important public service provided by the Fire District, the heavy traffic and emergency calls created by non-residents in the area, the distance of Snoqualmie Pass from other communities with emergency services, and because of the high amount of federal land ownership in the area, which severely limits  the local tax base. In fact, the Forest Service has acquired 20,000 acres in King and Kittitas counties at a cost of more than $52 million over just the last ten years. I would also note again that under this bill, this land would revert back to the Forest Service if for whatever reason a new fire station is not built on the property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this legislation would not guarantee that a new station would be built--the Fire District would have to work hard to gather the financing that would be required from state and local sources, as well as any applicable federal grants or loans. However, the conveyance of this site at no cost would help this Fire District hold down the overall cost of this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first introduced this legislation last year, with my colleague from Washington, Mr. Reichert. Unfortunately, the bill was not considered before the end of the last Congress. We reintroduced the bill in early March and were pleased the Natural Resources Committee held a subcommittee hearing on the bill in April to take testimony on the issues involved. At a subsequent markup of the bill last month, the acreage involved was reduced to acre and a half to address concerns that a fire station would  not require three acres. With this change, the bill was approved by voice vote in committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, at a meeting in the region, several environmental interest groups expressed reservations about the conveyance. Over the next several weeks, it is understood these groups will meet with the Fire District to discuss their concerns. I am committed to working with my colleagues from Washington state in the Senate, as well as the Natural Resources Committee, to facilitate these discussions to ensure we have the public safety infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of this unique area.  I am confident this can be done with little or no impact to the environment. It is my hope that the parties can reach agreement on this issue by September when  the Congress will reconvene and can resume work on the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee to review this issue and bring this bill forward. I look forward to continuing to work with the community at the Pass and my Washington colleagues to improve public safety in the area.</paragraph>
