    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army 1LT Jacob Fritz of Nebraska. Lieutenant Fritz died from wounds sustained in an ambush in Karbala, Iraq, on January 20. He was 25 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz was raised on his family's farm near Verdon, NE. From a young age, Lieutenant Fritz knew he wanted to be a leader. After graduating from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000, he followed through on this goal. I had the honor of nominating Lieutenant Fritz to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and he graduated from the Academy in 2005. His brother, Daniel Fritz, 22, followed in his footsteps and is currently in his third year at West Point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz was leading a unit of more than 30 soldiers in Iraq since October. Lieutenant Fritz described his mission as a liaison between Iraqi police and the U.S. Army. He said the work was challenging but rewarding. Thousands of brave Americans like Lieutenant Fritz are currently serving in Iraq. We are proud of Lieutenant Fritz's service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his brother, Lieutenant Fritz is survived by his parents Lyle and Noala and his younger brother Ethan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring 1LT Jacob Fritz.</paragraph>
