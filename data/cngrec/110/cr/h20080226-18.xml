    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President and his followers are telling the American public that the fight about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA, is endangering America; but the reality is that FISA is still fully in effect and administration officials have acknowledged that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this fight is really about is the President wants to give telecom companies retroactive immunity for turning over private information about Americans to the executive branch without a court order. Now, some comp anies refuse to go along, so obviously there could be a problem here. We should not and cannot give immunity until we know what we are giving immunity for. This is like a defendant coming into court saying to a judge, I may or may not have done something wrong. I don't want to tell</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would not accept that for an individual, and we must not accept it for corporations or for the government either. As John Adams said, we  are a government of laws, not men, and we must honor the Constitution.</paragraph>
