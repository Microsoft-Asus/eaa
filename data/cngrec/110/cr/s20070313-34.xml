    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1129">H.R. 1129</bill>. This important legislation is necessary to provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of an arterial road in the Lemay area of St. Louis County, MO. This road, the Lemay connector road, is the lynchpin of the long-term recovery of that community and will open several abandoned industrial sites to new industrial, commercial and retail development and create thousands of new much-needed jobs. The road was identified as the highest  priority for redeveloping the area in a federally-funded study conducted by the Missouri Department of Transportation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, in supporting this much-needed legislation. Not only will the road revive the economy of the communities around Lemay, it will also support the restoration of brownfields sites, improve public safety, create new parks and riding trails, and provide other recreational opportunities. With all of these benefits, it is not surprising then that the bill has broad bipartisan support from every relevant State  and local elected official and also here in the Congress. It has also been endorsed by the Missouri Department of Transportation, the local school district--Hancock Place School District and the local fire and police departments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I vividly recall the devastation that was caused by the the flooding in 1993 and one of the areas that was hardest hit was the community of Lemay. In response to that tragedy, Congress enacted an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. As a new member of that committee, I worked to appropriate supplemental funds for HUD's community development grants to compensate homeowners for losses and to clear the area. Property acquired with the funds, however, was required  to be maintained for uses consistent with open space, recreation or wetlands management. This was a one-time requirement, and no other property acquired using CDBG funds before or since the 1994 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act has carried similar deed restrictions. Furthermore, I want</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I also want to assure my colleages that no Federal funds will be used to construct or maintain the Lemay connector road. Neither St. Louis County nor the State of Missouri is seeking or will seek Federal assistance to build, maintain, or operate the road. In fact, the County has sent several letters to FEMA that it will not seek Federal funding for the road. Under terms reached by the St. Louis County and Missouri DOT, private developers will bear 100 percent of the cost  of construction of the road, and the road will be maintained by St. Louis County as part of its standard maintenance program,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my colleague from Missouri is correct that no Federal funds will be used for either construction or maintenance of this road. Furthermore, this road will become a county road and it will not be part of the Federal-aid system. Under current law, which this bill does not amend, the Lemay connector road is not an eligible use of Federal funding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
