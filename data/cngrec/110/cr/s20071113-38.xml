    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Rev. Edwin "Doc" Edmonds, a retired pastor and civil rights leader from New Haven who passed away Tuesday, November 6. Reverend Edmonds, or "Doc," as his friends called him, was one of the smartest, warmest, and most effective people I have ever had the pleasure to know, and led a truly inspirational life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in Texas, Edwin Edmonds was an excellent student, graduating high school at 15 years of age. In college he began losing his eyesight until he was legally blind. Despite having much difficulty reading and writing his assignments, he prevailed and graduated from Morehouse College in 1938, only 1 year later than expected. He would then go on to earn a bachelor's of sacred theology and a doctorate in social ethics from Boston University. In 1950, he was ordained in the Methodist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While teaching Sociology at Bennett College in Greensboro, NC, Reverend Edmonds became deeply involved with the civil rights movement, where he was elected president of the Greensboro chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1958, he met the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and the two exchanged letters until Dr. King's tragic death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also was an adviser to the "Greensboro Four," a group of brave college students committed to racial equality who would later lead the famous sit-in at a segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth's department store. This courageous protest is widely believed to be the first sit-in of the civil rights movement. Many Greensboro historians consider Reverend Edmonds a pioneer in the fight for equal rights for the city's minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1959, Reverend Edmonds moved to New Haven to become pastor of the Dixwell Avenue Congregational Church, which is now known as the United Church of Christ. As pastor, Mr. Edmonds soon became a fixture in the local community and quickly gained a reputation as one who was always willing to help those in need. His youngest daughter, Toni Walker, who serves as a representative in the Connecticut General Assembly, recalls that people in need often stayed at their home as guests. "As long as they  needed help, they were able to get it," Walker remembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Edmonds' congregants all knew that he was around to address not just their spiritual needs, but also everyday needs such as housing and jobs. Under his leadership, the church built a housing development and a creative arts center for the community. In addition, he was involved with many community service groups, such as the Urban League, the New Haven Clergy Association, the Amistad Committee and the New Haven Inter-Faith Ministerial Alliance. He was also a long-time member of the New  Haven Board of Education, serving as its chairman from 1979 to 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after retiring from the church in 1994, Mr. Edmonds remained active in his community. In 2000, after a meeting with single mothers who had to defer going to school to raise their children, he helped to establish Edwin R. and Maye B. Edmonds Scholarship Fund for single parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I bid farewell to "Doc" Edmonds and will keep his friends and family in my thoughts and prayers. I take solace in knowing that he will live on in all the people he helped to inspire to serve their community. As Clifton Graves, an activist and professor in New Haven who has known and looked up to Reverend Edmonds since he was a boy, said of his death: "We mourn this loss, but we celebrate his life and the contributions he made not only to New Haven but to Connecticut and indeed, around the  country."</paragraph>
