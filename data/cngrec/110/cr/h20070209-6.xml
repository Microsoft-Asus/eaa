    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Rule XI, Clause 2(a)(2) of Rules of the House of Representatives, I respectfully submit the rules for the 110th Congress for the Committee on Education and Labor for publication in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. The Committee adopted these rules by voice vote, with a quorum being present, at our organizational meeting on January 24, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rules of the Committee on Education and Labor for the 110th Congress</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) Regular meetings of the Committee shall be held on the second Wednesday of each month at 9:30 a.m., while the House is in session. When the Chairman believes that the Committee will not be considering any bill or resolution before the Committee and that there is no other business to be transacted at a regular meeting, he will give each member of the Committee, as far in advance of the day of the regular meeting as the circumstances make practicable, a written notice to that effect; and no  regular Committee meeting shall be held on that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) The Chairman may call and convene, as he considers necessary, additional meetings of the Committee for the consideration of any bill or resolution pending before the Committee or for the conduct of other Committee business. The Committee shall meet for such purposes pursuant to that call of the Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(c) If at least three members of the Committee desire that a special meeting of the Committee be called by the Chairman, those members may file in the offices of the Committee their written request to the Chairman for that special meeting. Immediately upon the filing of the request, the staff director of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of the filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after the filing of the request, the Chairman does not call the requested special meeting  to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the Committee may file in the offices of the Committee their written notice that a special meeting of the Committee will be held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the measure or matter to be considered at that special meeting. The Committee shall meet on that date and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(d) Legislative meetings of the Committee and its subcommittees shall be open to the public, including radio, television and still photography coverage, unless such meetings are closed pursuant to the requirements of House Rules. No business meeting of the Committee, other than regularly scheduled meetings, may be held without each member being given reasonable notice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(e) The Chairman of the Committee or of a subcommittee, as appropriate, shall preside at meetings or hearings, or, in the absence of the Chairman, the vice chairman, or the Chairman's designee shall preside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) Subject to clauses (b) and (c), Committee members may question witnesses only when they have been recognized by the Chairman for that purpose, and only for a 5-minute period until all members present have had an opportunity to question a witness. The questioning of witnesses in both Committee and subcommittee hearings shall be initiated by the Chairman, followed by the ranking minority party member and all other members alternating between the majority and minority party. The Chairman shall  exercise discretion in determining the order in which members will be recognized. In recognizing members to question witnesses in this fashion, the Chairman shall take into consideration the ratio of the majority to minority party members present and shall establish the order of recognition for questioning in such a manner as not to place the members of the majority party in a disadvantageous position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) The Chairman may permit a specified number of members to question a witness for longer than five minutes. The time for extended questioning of a witness under this clause shall be equal for the majority party and the minority party and may not exceed one hour in the aggregate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(c) The Chairman may permit Committee staff for the majority and the minority party members to question a witness for equal specified periods. The time for extended questioning of a witness under this clause shall be equal for the majority party and the minority party and may not exceed one hour in the aggregate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) Written records shall be kept of the proceedings of the Committee and of each subcommittee, including a record of the votes on any question on which a roll call is demanded. The result of each such roll call vote shall be made available by the Committee or subcommittee for inspection by the public at reasonable times in the offices of the Committee or subcommittee. Information so available for public inspection shall include a description of the amendment, motion, order, or other proposition  and the name of each member voting for and each member voting against such amendment, motion, order, or proposition, and the names of those members present but not voting. A record vote may be demanded by one-fifth of the members present or, in the apparent absence of a quorum, by any one member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) In accordance with Rule VII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, any official permanent record of the Committee (including any record of a legislative, oversight, or other activity of the Committee or any subcommittee) shall be made available for public use if such record has been in existence for 30 years, except that--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) any record that the Committee (or a subcommittee) makes available for public use before such record is delivered to the Archivist under clause 2 of Rule VII of the Rules of the House of Representatives shall be made available immediately, including any record described in subsection (a) of this Rule;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) any investigative record that contains personal data relating to a specific living individual (the disclosure of which would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy), any administrative record with respect to personnel, and any record with respect to a hearing closed pursuant to clause 2(g)(2) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives shall be available if such record has been in existence for 50 years; or</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) except as otherwise provided by order of the House, any record of the Committee for which a time, schedule, or condition for availability is specified by order of the Committee (entered during the Congress in which the record is made or acquired by the Committee) shall be made available in accordance with the order of the Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(c) The official permanent records of the Committee include noncurrent records of the Committee (including subcommittees) delivered by the Clerk of the House of Representatives to the Archivist of the United States for preservation at the National Archives and Records Administration, which are the property of and remain subject to the rules and orders of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(d)(l) Any order of the Committee with respect to any matter described in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be adopted only if the notice requirements of Committee Rule 17(c) have been met, a quorum consisting of a majority of the members of the Committee is present at the time of the vote, and a majority of those present and voting approve the adoption of the order, which shall be submitted to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, together with any accompanying report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) This subsection applies to any order of the Committee which--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(A) provides for the non-availability of any record subject to subsection (b) of this rule for a period longer than the period otherwise applicable; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(B) is subsequent to, and constitutes a later order under clause 4(b) of Rule VII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, regarding a determination of the Clerk of the House of Representatives with respect to authorizing the Archivist of the United States to make available for public use the records delivered to the Archivist under clause 2 of Rule VII of the Rules of the House of Representatives; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(C) specifies a time, schedule, or condition for availability pursuant to subsection (b) (3) of this Rule.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RULE 4.

Where feasible and practicable, 14 days' notice will be given of such meeting or hearing.</paragraph>
