    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the horrific events at Virginia Tech just a few days ago cause all of us to reflect. My heart goes out to the victims, to the victims' families, to the people who were injured. This is something that is just a terrible tragedy, an unthinkable, terrible tragedy. And as the father of three, including two in college, it really makes one stop and pause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say very, very respectfully, at a time of violence we need to reflect on this violence. And it certainly seems to me that upon reflection, to say that this country needs to have sensible gun control legislation, not legislation that would take guns out of the hands of people legitimately who have the right by the second amendment to own guns; but how could a deranged young man like the killer be able to just walk into a store and purchase any kind of guns at will and then use them to mow down  32 or 33 people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is all a matter of commonsense. We get emotional about these issues, but I am really speaking from the heart. Commonsense says that we need to have sensible gun control legislation so that criminals, people with mental illness, cannot just purchase guns at will and as many as they want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home city, New York City, our mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has been leading a crusade for sensible gun control legislation, and I agree with him. And, again, it takes a tragedy of this magnitude to kind of just sit and reflect and say, what are we doing or what are we not doing and why is it an infringement on anybody's second amendment rights to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, deranged people, and people who shouldn't own them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that this country really, really needs to reflect on its policies regarding guns. And, again, I support the second amendment, and I think there are many, many legitimate reasons for people to own guns. But after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, I say it again: I believe more than ever that this country needs to adopt sensible gun control legislation. We need to use our commonsense, and we need to try to prevent tragedies like the tragedy at Virginia Tech from happening again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know people say guns don't kill people, people kill people; that is true. But guns in the hands of the wrong people kill people. And I really think in all good conscience that we really need to reflect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, my heart goes out to the families, the victims, and all the students at Virginia Tech. But as a country, we need to come to grips with this problem.</paragraph>
