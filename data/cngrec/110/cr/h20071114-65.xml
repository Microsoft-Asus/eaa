  <narrative>WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13944]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress  reported yesterday on the hidden costs of the occupation of Iraq. We learned that the true cost so far is $1.3 trillion, or nearly double the amount the administration has been talking and has requested. And the price tag could soar to nearly $3.5 trillion if we continue on the administration's reckless course in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hidden financial costs of our involvement in Iraq are staggering, but yesterday we also learned that there are hidden human costs as well that are truly, truly heartbreaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBS News reported last night that the suicide rate among veterans is over twice as great as the suicide rate for the general population. In 2005 alone, there were at least 6,256 suicides among veterans in the 45 States that provided data to CBS. That is an astonishing 17 suicides per day for just that one year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those statistics are for veterans of all wars, and they are shocking. But the statistics for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are even more devastating. Veterans aged 20 to 24 have the highest suicide rate of all. For these young men and women, the suicide rate is two to four times higher than the suicide rate for the general population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet another report published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the mental health problems of Iraq veterans are much greater than previously thought. It found that Iraq veterans are more likely to report alcohol abuse, family conflicts, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder after being home for 6 months than immediately after their return. The suicide statistics tell us that the real Iraq death toll is significantly higher than the official count  of just over 3,860. And the mental health statistics tell us that the real number of wounded is much, much higher than the reported number of around 28,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of this terrible news means that we can no longer sit around and do nothing about the occupation of Iraq. We must take action immediately, and we must take it in two ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, America must do a much better job of meeting the physical and mental health needs of our veterans. The administration has underfunded and ignored the Veterans Administration system, leaving veterans stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare that stops them from getting the health care that they need. Congress has passed a bill that would help veterans to get care much faster. It improves conditions at VA hospitals and invests in new ways to treat physical and mental problems caused by the war.  The President needs to sign that bill as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, second, we must move immediately to end the occupation of Iraq and redeploy our troops. That is why I voted today for <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the bill is not perfect, it essentially says that funds authorized for Iraq will not be used to continue the occupation, but are to be used to achieve the safe and orderly redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what I and many others have been demanding, and that is what the American people have been asking. It is time to stop the death. It is time to stop the suffering. It is time to bring our brave troops home and do everything we can to help them and their families to rebuild their lives. Anything less is unacceptable and immoral.</paragraph>
