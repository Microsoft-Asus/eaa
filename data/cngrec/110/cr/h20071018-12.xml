    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, October 21 through October 27 will be National Save for Retirement Week. I hope folks take a few moments next week to look at their personal savings to see what more they can do to save for retirement. Saving for retirement can be an overwhelming task if left to the last minute. Just like most things in life, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Retirement doesn't have to be that way. You can choose to save.</paragraph>
