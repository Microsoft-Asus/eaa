  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share one of the many stories of bravery from our Armed Forces stationed in Iraq. I want to tell you about Navy Petty Officer Dustin Kirby, a native of Hiram, Georgia, a skilled Navy corpsman attached to the 2nd Marine Division in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Petty Officer Kirby was injured by sniper fire outside of Fallujah on Christmas Day. I had the honor of visiting him and his family at Bethesda Naval Hospital earlier this week, and I was deeply moved by his courage and dedication to the defense of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my visit, it was clear Petty Officer Kirby had touched many lives. In fact, while we visited he got a phone call from his fellow troops overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His wife, Lauren, his parents, Jack and Gail, his brother and sister, all shared with me their praise of his bravery and resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is because of soldiers like Petty Officer Dustin Kirby that I know we will achieve victory in Iraq. The dedication and determination of our Armed Forces is what protects our Nation every day and what will ultimately help deliver security and freedom in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Petty Officer Kirby for his service.</paragraph>
