  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill>, a bill making appropriations for the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year 2008. The bill that I present on behalf of the Appropriations Committee was approved unanimously by the Committee on September 12. Senator Stevens and I crafted this bill together in a bipartisan fashion. It appropriates $459.6 billion in new budget authority which is equal to the subcommittee's 302b allocation. This amount is $3.5 billion less than  the funding requested by the administration, not including supplemental spending for the cost of war. It is the same level as recommended by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues this is a good bill, one that is critical for our Nation's defense. We believe it meets the Senate's priorities: ensuring readiness, protecting our forces, and acquiring the critical equipment that our service men and women need and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill fully funds a 3.5 percent military and civilian pay raise, a half percent more than requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It recommends adding nearly $950 million for the Defense Health Program to ensure that the health of our military families is protected. This includes $486 million above the budget request to support our military hospitals which suffer from significant shortfalls and are stressed by our wounded heroes returning from war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Appropriations Committee included $1 billion above the President's request to purchase equipment for our National Guard and Reserves recognizing the serious shortfalls that exist in our reserve components.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It fully funds the Army's highest priority, the Future Combat System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It supports the purchase of 20 F-22s and 12 Joint Strike Fighters as requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes $470 million to support a multi-year purchase of the Virginia class submarine, and provides full funding for the V-22 for the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would fund the authorized level for the Missile Defense Program, about $300 million below the request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues all know, this is a massive bill, with thousands of programs. While most of the administration's proposal is funded as requested, the bill is not a rubberstamp. Senator STEVENS and I have recommended reductions in many programs because of schedule delays, cost increases, or other similar problems. In each case it is our judgment that the funds should be reapplied to other areas to address other urgent needs. In doing so, we have been able to increase funding for health  care, National Guard equipment, a higher pay raise, and many other worthy initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also raise the subject of earmarks in this measure. As you know, the Congress passed new legislation which requires that the committee identify each congressionally directed spending item, which we commonly refer to as earmarks. I want to point out that this bill includes more than $4 billion in adds which were not requested by the President. However, under the definition in <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> very few of these items are earmarks. For example, in many cases, the committee chose to provide funding  for items not because they were requested by a Member of the Senate, but because of the national merits of the program. Under the definition in <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, these are not earmarks. None the less we have included in the report the name of all Members who requested such increases. In fact, to ensure full transparency the committee report not only lists the few earmarks that are required</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is October 2. We have already started a new fiscal year. Our Defense Department is operating on scaled back funding under a short term continuing resolution. That is no way to provide for our common defense. It is critical that we expedite the consideration of this measure to ensure that our men and women in uniform and their families have the funding they need for their pay, their hospitals, their housing, and their schools. The funding that we recommend in this measure to equip our forces  is critically needed as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand the desire of many Members to address policies which relate to the war in Iraq. The war is extremely controversial; our Nation is divided. This matter is so serious it deserves the Senate's full attention and thoughtful debate, but that will take time. While we don't all agree on the proper course in Iraq, there remains one thing in which there is universal agreement. We must support those who are willing to wear our Nation's uniform and make the sacrifices to protect the rest of  us. That is a huge sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope that in the coming weeks the Senate will consider a supplemental spending measure to address funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. We would urge our colleagues to hold off on supplemental related issues until that bill is considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To this end, I have resolved to oppose any amendment which could jeopardize quick enactment of this bill. We can best show our support to the military by completing action on the fiscal year 2008 Defense appropriations bill as quickly as possible. I hope all of my colleagues will be able to endorse these recommendations and work with us to pass this legislation. Our men and women in uniform deserve no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor. I hope the Chair will recognize the vice chairman of the committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to endorse the comments of the chairman of our subcommittee regarding this Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 to the Senate. This bill does reflect a bipartisan approach. This is the approach Senator Inouye and I have always maintained regarding the Department of Defense appropriations. The fact is this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee almost 3 weeks ago by a unanimous vote. We hope, as the chairman of the  subcommittee said, to finish this bill this week so we can proceed to conference as soon as possible after the October recess for Columbus Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our fiscal year began yesterday. Normally this bill would have been signed by the President by this time. But it is a matter that still has extreme urgency, as far as I am concerned, to get it before the President. As Senator Inouye has said, as a temporary measure we do have the continuing resolution in place to keep operations ongoing in the Department of Defense until this bill becomes law. That is a temporary measure. There are many acquisition activities that simply cannot be initiated  under a continuing resolution. They require an annual appropriations bill to be enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the continuing resolution, there are very limited amounts available each month to the Department. That is not sufficient to sustain a force in the field as we have in Afghanistan and Iraq. As a matter of fact, there are hundreds of thousands of men and women in uniform deployed throughout the world. They serve our country now in over 154 countries, and in our own country here, in the United States. Their bravery and dedication to our country is extraordinary and their sacrifices do not  go unnoticed. We must not lose sight of our responsibility to support them in an expeditious manner, and completely. These people depend on us and it is our job to see to it they have all of the supplies, ammunition, and equipment they need to carry out their orders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year the Department of Defense faces the critical challenge of balancing the cost of maintaining high levels of readiness, being ready to respond to any call wherever it occurs, whenever it is necessary. This means we must adequately invest in those technologies that will prepare us for the future, prepare us for the threats of  tomorrow as well as conduct the activities we have ongoing in those 154 countries and in particular in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill Senator Inouye and I present today reflects a prudent balance among those challenges. I concur--may I say I concur reluctantly--in Senator Inouye's request that we not have supplemental items added to this bill. This is the first year we have not had, as part of the bill, a so-called bridge to cover the transition between one fiscal year to the next, in terms of the demands of the war. Very clearly, if we are going to send the MRAPs over to Iraq--these are the new vehicles  that protect lives, that are saving lives--we need funding in advance. I am told we have over 30 different manufacturers working on these machines now. They have to be paid. I do believe the supplemental is absolutely necessary and I am very worried about it. It is to me a very difficult thing to believe the time might come when we do not have the money to pay for these MRAPs and they will stay in this country rather than be taken to Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other new facilities and equipment that are needed by the Department of Defense. This is an ongoing. I was talking to my colleague Sid Ashworth today about the transformation of the military. At the same time as our people are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and are defending us in these other 152 countries, we face the problem of transforming our military into the military of the future. New technologies, new techniques, and new requirements demand change. That change demands new  equipment and new research to assure we have the basic equipment and technology base we need to protect this country for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worry about a process that is slowing down the money that now for 4 years has been presented in a supplemental, an addition to this bill as it was passed. This will be the first year we have not included that in the consideration of the appropriations bill. As I said, I am following the lead of our chairman, but I do believe we cannot go home this year without providing the money to carry over through the new year and into the period of next year before we can get another bill passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is, to me, a very serious matter and one I hope to speak on later, at great length, as a matter of fact. But I do again thank Senator Inouye, our chairman, for his courtesy, his leadership, and his friendship as we move this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We welcome for consideration any amendments our colleagues wish to present.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment I have offered would appropriate $3 billion in emergency spending for border security operations. It is virtually the same amendment we had on the DHS appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment will allow purchases to be made for unmanned aerial vehicles, ground sensors, and vehicle barriers. It provides funding for the construction of 700 miles of fencing. It would establish operational control over all of our borders. It provides funding to obtain more bed space to detain immigrants for overstaying their visas, and it provides funding for States and localities that undergo training to assist the Federal Government in enforcing immigration law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a veto threat on the DHS bill. I am hoping that this amendment, which passed 89 to 1--a similar version of it on the DHS appropriations bill--will find its way on this legislation, which I hope will get signed into law by the President.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham amendment. It is an amendment which I have been involved in helping to develop. It is an amendment that was offered on the Homeland Security bill, and essentially it is the same concept. The purpose of this amendment is something on which I think there is general agreement in the Senate, which is that we supply adequate resources to make sure that our border is secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this is an effort we have been pursuing for quite a while. I had the good fortune to be chairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security of the Appropriations Committee, and during that time we dramatically increased our commitment to border security, especially in the area of the number of agents, in the area of the number of detention beds, in the area of fencing, in the area of electronic and virtual fencing, and in the area of making technology available and support facilities available  to border security agents, and the ICE agents. It is a ramping-up process, however, and there is still a ways to go, although we have made very significant strides. Unfortunately, in our opinion, on this side of the aisle--and this amendment was agreed to by the other side</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what does that require? Well, this amendment doesn't put specific numbers relative to the number of agents or detention beds or fencing, but what it does put in place is an additional $3 billion in emergency funding, which will essentially go toward three major areas, the first of which is agents. We know that we need about 20,000 agents on the border. We know we are headed toward that number, but we know it is going to take a significant increase in funding for us to get to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we wish we could sort of wave a magic wand of dollars and produce these agents overnight, but we can't. These people are highly skilled. They require special qualities as individuals. They have to be obviously law enforcement individuals, but they also have to speak Spanish. They have to have the character and the personality to be able to work in a very intense environment and deal with very threatening situations, while at the same time dealing with people who are coming across the border  and trying to make a better way of life for themselves and shouldn't be treated in a criminal way but should be treated as decent human beings trying to seek a better way of life in the United States, who try to come in inappropriately but having to go back. Handling that type of situation requires a little bit more care and sensitivity than dealing with somebody who is coming across to sell drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the individuals we need to attract into the border security effort are high-quality, high-caliber individuals. You can't gather them up overnight. It takes awhile to get the applicants and then put them through the schooling process, and it does take money to do that. This amendment will allow us, to the extent that we can find these types of individuals to populate this workforce, to do exactly that so we will have a full complement of agents on the southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it will add detention beds which are critical. There is a belief that we need around 33,000 detention beds, I think is the number. We are headed toward building out a significant number of detention beds, and this amendment--or the dollars in this amendment--will give the Department the resources it needs to accomplish the additional detention beds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are detention beds important? Because we have gone from a policy which was essentially catch-and-release of 2 years ago, or 3 years ago, to a policy where we actually catch and hold people. We no longer say come back in a few months after we catch you crossing the border illegally; we would say come back in a few months and appear before the court, and what happened was people never came back. We would send them off and they would never return, not surprisingly. Now we hold these folks, and  we make sure they have their day in court, that they receive the proper protections of our law enforcement system, but that if they are found to have entered this country illegally, they get sent back. But it takes money, and that is why this amendment is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, we are building a fence in those areas, a physical fence in those areas where we need fencing. Fencing isn't appropriate for the entire border, but in our more urban areas along the border, it is appropriate, and it is expensive. So this money in this bill will allow us to complete the fencing commitments which we think are necessary. Equally important, it will put in place the operations of what amounts to what we call a virtual fence, but it is a real fence. There will be towers essentially.  We have a tremendous electronic surveillance capability, oversight capability through unmanned aerial vehicles. All of this has been put into the works, and we are in the process of building out this system of surveillance in nonphysical fenced areas but areas which will have basically an electronic fence and a visual capability. But that, again, costs a lot of money. So this amendment fully funds the movement in that direction. That is what we need to do. We need to spend this money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is a lot of money, $3 billion, there is no question about it. But I see it very much as part of the war on terror, as a necessary element to protecting our culture and our society. A country which can't control its borders, which doesn't know who is coming across its borders, is a country which is at considerable risk. It is at considerable risk for a lot of reasons, but obviously the primary reason is the threat of terrorism. We have an obligation to our citizenry to make sure as people  come across the southern border, we know who they are and we know that they are coming across legally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the American people have grown--and rightly so, I am afraid--a little cynical about our efforts on the southern border. They see us say: Well, we are going to secure the southern border, but then they don't see us putting the resources on the border to accomplish that. These dollars will complete the debate on the issue of resources. The dollars will be there. Whether the management capability is there, whether the build-out capability is there, that is still an issue--I admit to that--but  at least the dollars will be in the pipeline to accomplish this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a practical matter, I think this is a very important step forward. I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina, who has been a leader on this effort for awhile. He was obviously a leader on immigration reform, and he has backed up his words on immigration reform, in that the first step in effective immigration reform is effective border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is true. That is essential. He has backed that up with this amendment which puts the dollars in place to accomplish this. That is a corollary to this whole debate, which is that we do need to significantly overhaul our immigration laws, make them more appropriate to the times and to the situations. But you cannot get the public  confidence to do immigration reform unless the American people believe at the outset that our border--especially the southern  border--is secure from people being able to cross willy-nilly into this country illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These dollars will put in place the resources necessary to accomplish that, to make sure our southern border is secure on the issue of crossings. It may take a couple years for them to bear fruit because there is not an instant response with the hiring of agents. But the fact is that the resources will be in the pipeline to accomplish that, and the American people can have confidence that it is going to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for his amendment. I am happy to join him as a cosponsor of the amendment. I hope it will be adopted unanimously or with a large majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
