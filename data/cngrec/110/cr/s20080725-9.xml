    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak today about former Senator Jesse Helms, who passed away on July 4, 2008, at the age of 86. I knew Senator Helms well, and I am sure I am joined by many of my colleagues in saying that he will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Helms was born in Monroe, NC, in 1921. His first full-time job was as a sportswriter for the Raleigh Times. After serving as a recruiter for the U.S. Navy during World War II, Senator Helms became the city news editor for the Times before moving on to do journalistic work in both radio and television. In 1960, he began working at the Capitol Broadcasting Company in Raleigh as the executive vice president, vice chairman of the board, and assistant CEO. He became famous in his home State  for his daily CBC editorials, which featured his now-famous southern anecdotes occasionally laced with his sometimes provocative political views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to coming to the Senate, Senator Helms' only political experience consisted of two terms on the Raleigh City Council. However, in 1972, Senator Helms became the first Republican Senator elected from North Carolina in the 20th century, replacing the retiring Senator B. Everett Jordan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his three-decade tenure in the Senate, Jesse became known as one of the Chamber's staunchest conservatives. His refusal to compromise on his beliefs was the source of both his greatest strength as a legislator and, as I am sure some would argue, his greatest weakness. Indeed, I don't think there are any of us who served alongside Senator Helms who did not, at one time or another, find themselves in a disagreement with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, while I didn't always agree with Jesse, I do have a number of fond personal memories of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, when I first came to the Senate in 1977, Senator Helms was nearing the end of his first term. About 3 months into that first session, still becoming acclimated to life in the Senate, I took a few moments to write down some of my early impressions of my fellow Senators. About Jesse, I wrote that he was "one of the dearest people in the Senate," and that he had always treated me with kindness and respect. I also noticed that, despite having a reputation for being an unmovable conservative,  he had a knowledge of parliamentary procedure and tactics that was virtually unmatched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple years later, I witnessed this knowledge first-hand when Senator Helms and I found ourselves on the same side of the debate over what was being called a "labor reform" bill. Sadly, as I was working with a number of my colleagues to sustain a filibuster against this unabashedly radically liberal pro-union legislation, our friend Senator James Allen passed away. While we were all saddened by the loss of our dear friend, at the back of our minds we were worried that, without Senator Allen's  mastery of Senate procedure, our efforts might fail. However, Senator Helms stepped up and provided much needed insight, helping us to block this harmful legislation. At one point during this debate, while many of us were worried about the strength of the filibuster, Senator Helms assured us, saying that we would keep the necessary Senators on the floor "if they have to wear their pajamas and bedroom slippers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we were all surprised during the latter part of Senator Helms' tenure when he coauthored the landmark 2002 legislation authorizing funds that were, at that time, unparalleled for international AIDS relief. Many of his colleagues, including myself, had sparred with Jesse over providing support for AIDS relief and research. But, in those last few months of his Senate career, I believe he showed the world that, while he wasn't always the most agreeable of politicians, he was a compassionate  man who was committed to doing what he thought was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the Helms family. As I said, Jesse and I did not always agree on the issues before the Senate, but I can say, without reservation, that he was a dedicated public servant and dear friend to those of us who knew him well.</paragraph>
