  <narrative>AMERICANS DEMAND ACTION -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4879]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the American people are fed up with rising energy prices. They are fed up that the leadership here in Washington does not seem to have the will to step forward and make tough decisions so that we can begin to ease the pain at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be working with many of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to try to bring real relief to the American people. In particular, I am proud to be supporting legislation such as the American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act that would open up a small part of ANWR for energy production and exploration today and use funds obtained through the sale of land leases to invest in alternative energy sources for tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These plans would adhere to the strictest environmental requirements in our Nation's history. This type of comprehensive approach is direct. It is timely. It is vital to building a stronger strategic energy portfolio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people demand and deserve action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
