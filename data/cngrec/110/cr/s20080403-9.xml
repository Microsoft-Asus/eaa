  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me begin this morning by congratulating my good friends Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd for their great work in getting us to the point we are today. Of course, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus were deeply involved in that with regard to the tax portion of the bipartisan bill we have before us. I think this is a good start to the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also say to my good friend, the majority leader, I think this is a good example of how we can work together and accomplish something on an important issue for the country. We know now we will have amendments on both sides because that is the way the Senate operates. It is my hope we can get to the end of the trail here in the very near future and have a bipartisan bill we can all feel proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin the debate by again thanking Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd for getting us to this point. We look forward to moving forward as rapidly as possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
