    <paragraph>Then, Madam Speaker, I rise to reserve a point of order against consideration of <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill> because I believe that the bill itself fits the definition of an earmark. And I would ask the author of the bill if he might, by way of making my point of order, I would quote rule XXI, clause 9(d), which states the definition for a congressional earmark, and it states, Means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member providing, authorizing or recommending  a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority, or other expenditure, or targeted to a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would be pleased to yield to the author of the bill as to why this bill doesn't fit that definition of an earmark.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may make his point of order, but may not yield.</chair>

    <paragraph>I reserve a point of order then. I make my point of order against the consideration of <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The point of order may not be reserved.</chair>

    <paragraph>I make a point of order against consideration of <bill type="h" number="1100">H.R. 1100</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I believe I have made my point that this bill indeed fits the definition of a congressional earmark under rule XXI, clause 9(d) and, therefore, violates the rules of the House and, therefore, should not be considered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair finds that the entry on page 6 of the report of the Committee on Natural Resources constitutes compliance with clause 9(a) of rule XXI. The point of order is overruled.</chair>
