    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since we have all been gone, the Glasgow Airport has been bombed, Piccadilly Circus in London was the site of an attempted terrorist attack, another attempt on a hospital, and within 48 hours, the British Intelligence Agency rounded up several credible suspects. Their use of intelligence should be commended. They have faced terrorist attacks on their soil for over 30 years and put in place the tools to deal with these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, it seems the liberal leadership of this Congress wants to backtrack in our attempts to track and survey potential terrorists by scaling back our critical intelligence-gathering efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They took issue with the program designed to monitor phone calls from potential terrorists. They railed against the PATRIOT Act. They even shifted funds from critical intelligence-gathering programs to put it into a slush fund to study global warming. Mr. Speaker, the last time I checked, global warming didn't have one single thing to do with putting a bomb in Piccadilly Circus or trying to blow up the JFK airport. Global warming didn't bomb the USS Cole or take down the Twin Towers.  Climate change can be studied, but it need not be done at the expense of human intelligence needed to help eliminate international terrorism. We need to adjust our priorities. It's time to get to work.</paragraph>
