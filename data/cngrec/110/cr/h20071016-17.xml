    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush and congressional Republicans know they have a perception problem with the American people when it comes to being fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, they inherited a record surplus from President Clinton back in 2001, and over the next 6 years they turned that surplus into record deficits. In fact, it's so bad that President Bush has the distinction of borrowing more money from foreign nations than all of his 42 predecessors combined. That is not a record to brag about. And so now the President and some Republicans are attempting to wipe away 6 years of fiscal mismanagement by opposing a bipartisan bill that would provide quality  health care coverage to 10 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, the bill that they are opposing is completely paid for. You see, when we took over the House in January, we restored pay-as-you-go rules so that we could finally tackle our Nation's deficit. The bipartisan children's health care bill would not add one cent to our Nation's deficit. And House Republicans need to realize that this bill is bipartisan for a reason.</paragraph>
