    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a part of National Peace Corps Week, I wish to join many of my colleagues in celebrating the 47th anniversary of the Peace Corps and honoring the important work of Peace Corps volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this week, Peace Corps volunteers from around the world who have served over the years will share their overseas experiences with schools and community groups around the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By giving presentations during Peace Corps Week, former Peace Corps volunteers will help Americans better understand the people and cultures they have experienced, and the many benefits of Peace Corps service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By making presentations in classrooms, former volunteers will help create greater global awareness among students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peace Corps is one of our most effective and successful foreign aid programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the establishment of the Peace Corps by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, more than 190,000 U.S. citizens, including 25,000 from my home State of California, have served their country in the cause of peace by living and working in 139 developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world has changed since 1961--and the Peace Corps has succeeded in keeping up with these changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While education and agriculture are still an important part of what a Peace Corp volunteer does, today's volunteers also work on HIV/AIDS awareness, information technology, and business development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many volunteers work in orphanages with HIV-positive children, implement programs for at-risk youth, and create support groups for HIV-positive people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Business volunteers conduct seminars on subjects like marketing, strategic planning, and tourism development. They work with women and minority groups to strengthen their participation in the economic system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agriculture volunteers may find themselves working with farmers to implement techniques to improve soil quality and conserve water--or on the business end conducting production cost-and-price analyses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peace Corps also assists countries in need by supplying Crisis Corps volunteers--former volunteers who return to the field on a short-term basis. In 2005, for the first time in its history, Peace Corps deployed 272 Crisis Corps volunteers domestically to assist in Hurricane Katrina relief efforts along the gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also in 2005, Crisis Corps volunteers were deployed to Sri Lanka and Thailand to assist with rebuilding tsunami devastated areas, and to Guatemala following Hurricane Stan. As part of PEPFAR, Crisis Corps has deployed volunteers to Uganda, Kenya, Namibia and Zambia. Finally, Crisis Corps is working with Peace Corps posts in Central America and the Caribbean to address disaster preparedness in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's Peace Corps is more vital than ever, working in emerging and essential areas such as information technology and business development. They have made significant and lasting contributions around the world in agriculture, education, health, HIV/AIDS, and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace Corps volunteers continue to help countless individuals who want to build a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when the United States is seeking to reclaim the respect and admiration of the world and once again be seen as a champion and a leader of democracy, justice, and human rights, Peace Corps volunteers revitalize faith in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are leaders and diplomats, and they serve as an inspiration not only to their fellow American citizens but to citizens all across the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support the Peace Corps and celebrate National Peace Corps Week.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National Peace  Corps Week and to recognize the 47th anniversary of this distinguished organization. Since 1961, the Peace Corps has dispatched over 190,000 volunteers to promote a greater understanding between the United States and the rest of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of National Peace Corps Week, returning volunteers will be visiting Washington for several days of events. Many of them will use this opportunity to share their experiences in local classrooms. I heartily applaud these fine men and women for their initiative in seeking to make the world a better place to live and for the positive impact they have had beyond our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now more than ever, the work of Peace Corps volunteers is an important asset within the diplomatic toolbox of the United States. Their efforts augment official diplomatic acts of our Government and add a personal dimension which could not be duplicated in any other way. When a volunteer travels abroad, they provide others with a glimpse of what it means to be an American and the values we cherish here at home. I encourage all Americans to make the kind of selfless contributions these volunteers  provide to the international community. The Peace Corps has proven that individual citizens working together can promote and strengthen the image of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace Corps volunteers inspire us all, and I am proud to say that 213 volunteers from the State of Oregon are currently serving in over 50 developing countries. These Oregonians complement the thousands of others who have served in the Peace Corps, and they brighten our hopes for a better tomorrow. Peace Corps volunteers have shown a level of dedication and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary. I invite all Oregonians, and all Americans, to join me this week in commending their efforts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Peace Corps volunteers during National Peace Corps Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, 25 active U.S. Peace Corps volunteers are from Wyoming. They have joined a unique organization of people who have taken the initiative and make the personal commitment to assist those around the world who are less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace Corps volunteers are the face of America in many countries. They are often on the frontline in the most primitive of environments, working tirelessly with local leaders to build a better future. Their optimism is often contagious as they assist communities in building infrastructure, developing resources, and improving basic health care, education, and business opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend all the men and women of the Peace Corps for their personal sacrifices. It is not easy to leave behind friends and family and the comforts of home. Yet I often hear that the rewards of bringing aid to those suffering from political unrest, natural disasters, disease, and a lack of economic opportunities are well worth it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peace Corps volunteers' reputation as ambassadors of good will demonstrates the ability of individuals to make a difference in the world. Their firsthand knowledge of the challenges people face on a day-to-day basis give those of us in the United States a better understanding of our world. I applaud their efforts and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize the men and women from Wyoming who are currently serving as U.S. Peace Corps volunteers: Pamela J. Anderson, Jason N. Arnold, Alexandria L. Blute, Katie E. Boysen, Bria M. Chimenti, Joanne A. Cook, Jenna M. Dillon, Heather Dixon, Jeannie M. Freeman, Annie B. Gierhart, Alexis L. Grieve, Daniel J. Healy, Kevin U. Malatesta, Joshuah C. Marshall, Korie C. Merrill, Michael O. Nielsen, Katherine G. Oglietti, Kathleen F. Petersen, Rachel L. Petersen, Michael S. Quinn, Garrett  C. Schiche, Brian M. Steen, Dayna C. Wolter, Angela E. Zivkovich, and Aaron R. Zueck.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I stand before you today to congratulate the Peace Corps on 47 years of service. The Peace Corps was founded on March 1, 1961, when President John F. Kennedy signed an Executive order establishing the Peace Corps as a new Government agency. Over the years, 190,000 volunteers, including nearly 2,700 Georgians, have served in more than 139 countries around the world. Throughout its history, Peace Corps volunteers have responded to the issues of this world with energy,  purpose, and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From February 25 to March 3, 2008, thousands of former Peace Corps volunteers will share their experiences with schools and community groups across the United States during Peace Corps Week. Through these activities, former Peace Corps volunteers will help our citizens better understand the advantages of becoming a Peace Corps volunteer. They will also have the opportunity to educate about the people and cultures they have encountered during their service. Additionally, by making presentations  in classrooms, former volunteers will help create greater global awareness among students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late U.S. Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, who was my good friend and colleague for many years. As the corps' first post-Cold War director, Paul steered the Peace Corps into a new era. I was pleased the President honored Paul posthumously in 2001 by renaming the Peace Corps headquarters in Washington, DC, as the Paul D. Coverdell Peace Corps Headquarters as well as renaming the Peace Corps World Wise Schools program as the Paul D. Coverdell  World Wise Schools program. I am proud to support an organization that such a distinguished Georgian was so instrumental in shaping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the President announced the reopening of a Peace Corps mission in Rwanda during his visit to the country last week. I believe the Peace Corps will make an important contribution to the recovery of that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, there are 8,079 Peace Corps volunteers and trainees in 68 posts serving 74 countries. Of those volunteers, 160 are from my home State of Georgia. I want to take this opportunity to thank those Georgians and all Americans who have served in the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps is a critical piece of our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts worldwide. I look forward to supporting the Peace Corps as a Member of the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the past 47 years of service of over 190,000 Peace Corps volunteers who have served our Nation and aided developing nations worldwide. This week our Nation celebrates their contributions toward the elimination of global poverty and disease that continues to deprive millions of people the opportunity to fulfill their goals and dreams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry David Thoreau noted that "One is not born into the world to do everything, but to do something." To do something is the foundation of the Peace Corps' mission. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps to promote peace and friendship and challenged Americans, young and old, to help their Nation and the world by sharing their talents with those in developing countries. Many Americans have heeded his call to service. Currently, approximately 8,000 volunteers serve in  74 countries to help train and provide skills to those in need and act as American cultural ambassadors to those nations. However, their work does not end there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud that 261 Peace Corps volunteers from Pennsylvania are currently serving abroad. These men and women will join the ranks of former Pennsylvanian volunteers who continue to leave their mark on the world such as Christina Luongo from Stroudsburg, PA, who served as a nutrition education volunteer in Bolivia from 2002 to 2005; Abigail Calkins, from Philadelphia, PA, who served as a community development volunteer in Cameroon from 1987 to 1990 and is now working at the University of  Pennsylvania researching breast and endometrial cancer; and Betrice Grabish, from North Wales, PA, who served as an English teacher in Uzbekistan from 1992 to 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate National Peace Corps Week, I would also like to highlight the vital contributions that a predecessor of mine, Senator Harris Wofford, made toward launching the Peace Corps in 1961. As special assistant to President John F. Kennedy, Senator Wofford helped plan and launch the Peace Corps and later moved with his family to Ethiopia, where he served as the Peace Corps' special representative to Africa and director of its Ethiopia program. Ever since, Senator Wofford  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="1267">S1267</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our world becomes interconnected, more Americans will need to interact with those who live outside our borders. Peace Corps volunteers learn more than 250 languages, which provides them the skills to compete globally as well as assist the U.S. Government in national security areas where critical language skills are essential. Many Peace Corps volunteers go on to serve in Congress, the executive branch, and the Foreign Service. I salute the Peace Corps for its tremendous work and the dedication  of its volunteers who have not hesitated to help improve our world. On this week marking the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Peace Corps, I call on everyone to join me in celebrating its historic achievements.</paragraph>
