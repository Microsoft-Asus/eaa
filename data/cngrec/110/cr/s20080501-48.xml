    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Cochran and others to celebrate the achievements of the members and alumni of AmeriCorps and to recognize the week of May 11, 2008, as "AmeriCorps Week." These young men and women have dedicated their time and efforts toward improving the lives of all Americans by protecting the environment, strengthening education, responding to disasters, and supporting public health and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Since 1994, AmeriCorps has encouraged citizens to volunteer, serve, and address the unmet needs of our Nation. About 542,000 people have become AmeriCorps members and have pledged "to get things done for America." These citizens have provided more than 705,000,000 hours of service, hard work, and dedication to improve our communities. In addition, since its inception, more than $5 billion of AmeriCorps funds have been invested back into our communities and have helped leverage hundreds of  millions of dollars of additional funds and in-kind donations from external sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, 75,000 AmeriCorps members were able to give back to this Nation, and those members recruited more than 1,700,000 community volunteers to join them in their mission. Their volunteers served in over 4,000 nonprofit organizations, schools, and faith-based and community organizations across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In return for service, AmeriCorps members have earned more than $1.4 billion to go toward furthering their education, and after completing their service, many alumni remain engaged in their communities as volunteers, teachers, and nonprofit professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Connecticut, since AmeriCorps was created, more than 7,000  AmeriCorps members have served about 9.5 million hours and earned over $20 million toward their education.  From my own experience as a Peace Corps member, I know it takes a tremendous amount of perseverance, commitment, and passion to serve, but I also know the emotional reward achieved in dedicating your time to help others. Emerson wrote, "It is one of the most beautiful compensations of life that no man can sincerely  try to help another without helping himself." It is my hope that all Americans take the opportunity to develop a deeper sense of community, a renewed sense of national purpose, and a shared experience of sacrifice to serve our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> During this "AmeriCorps Week," we must take the time to recognize, salute, and thank those Americans who have answered the call to serve by joining AmeriCorps; we must acknowledge the tremendous accomplishments and important contributions of the AmeriCorps members, alumni, and community partners; and, we must raise awareness about the importance of national and community service. Our collective imaginations, ideas, energy, and resolve are needed to solve our Nation's problems and rekindle  our  American community. I encourage citizens of all ages to consider serving in AmeriCorps and contributing their skills and talents to bettering this Nation.</paragraph>
