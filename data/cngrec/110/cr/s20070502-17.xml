    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask that Senator PETE DOMENICI be removed as a cosponsor to <bill type="s" number="1038">S. 1038</bill>, the Workforce Health Improvement Act, and added as a cosponsor to <bill type="s" number="1083">S. 1083</bill>, the SKIL Act. Let the RECORD reflect that due to a clerical error Senator DOMENICI was inadvertently added as a co-sponsor to the Wokforce Health Improvement Act.</paragraph>
