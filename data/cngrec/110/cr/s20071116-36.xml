    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is another one of those bittersweet moments for us all as we say goodbye to a member of our extended family, Denis O'Donovan. Denis will soon be retiring and bringing to a close a truly remarkable career in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Denis has worked in several offices in the Senate during his career, but I would like to think he saved his best for his last post--as the chief clerk of our committee, a post he has held since 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when I first came to the committee and had the opportunity to observe Denis at work. I don't think I have ever met anyone who had a better eye for detail, or a better sense of making sure everything was in its proper place. He has a great mind for numbers, and anyone who has ever had to work with a budget knows how frustrating it can be to make sure all the columns add up and are balanced--top to bottom--and--left to right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senate's only accountant, I admire that kind of precision. In fact, I think our love of numbers may be one of the reasons why we got along so well and enjoyed each other so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years that I have served on the committee, I have had the chance to work with Denis as its chairman and now, as the ranking member. No matter which party had control of the committee, Denis was always there, ready to help in any way he could. That is why he was such a good chief clerk for me, for Senator Kennedy, and for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back, Denis has a lot to be proud of. He has been a part of a lot of the good work the committee has done over the years. Senator KENNEDY and I have brought a long list of measures to the Senate floor and then on to the President for his signature and Denis played an important role in every one of them. Thanks in no small part to you, Denis, we have made great progress on a lot of issues that will make life better for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now Denis is about to head off to that thoughtful and reflective world known as retirement. He will finally have the time to finish that book--not the one he was writing--the one he was reading. For now, there will be time to do all those things Denis has been putting off for someday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a family tradition we call the list of 100 things. Simply put, it is the to do list of all time. You put together a list of the 100 things you have always wanted to do someday--and then you start to get them done--one by one. It is a little more complicated than that, but I will get together with you to explain the whole procedure to you later. It will be one of our gifts to you on your retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know what you are thinking--just what I wanted--more stuff to do!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trust me, you will enjoy this project. And the next time I see you, we will compare notes so I can see how you are doing in your quest for adventure in your retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope Senator KENNEDY will not mind, but I would like to close with a bit of Irish cheer for you--the words of a toast I have often heard, and I am sure you have too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Denis, as you leave us:</paragraph>
