    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution recognizes our servicemen and -women who have fought and died for our country and the sacrifice made by their families. The resolution provides for the flag over the Capitol to be raised at half-staff once a month in honor of all the U.S. men and women that have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we in Congress and the majority of the American people go about our day-to-day lives, this small gesture should serve as a constant reminder of those brave men and women who have given their lives in defense of the freedoms that we, the American people, enjoy. We owe all of our fallen servicemen and -women a debt that can never be repaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support this resolution, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Resolution 61, which expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States flag flown over the United States Capitol should be lowered to half-mast 1 day each month in honor of the brave men and women from the United States who have lost their lives in military conflicts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of those who work in or visit the Capitol each day, the flag that flies atop this building is an emblem of the democratic principles that guide this body. This powerful symbol of freedom is even more striking when it's lowered to half-mast, signaling that our Nation is in mourning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of our military who defend our Nation in the time of war may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Lowering the flag atop the Capitol once a month in their honor is a small yet meaningful way to communicate how deeply their loss is felt by all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being a moving tribute to the members of our military who we have lost, it is also a reminder to all Members of Congress that the actions we take--or do not take--have profound consequences on the men and women of our military. When we talk about funding our armored vehicles or express our views on intelligence gathering in the war on terror, it is imperative that we do not forget the real ramifications that our decisions will have on our servicemen and -women who must live with  the consequences of our actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this moving tribute to our Nation's Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to the sponsor of this bill, Representative Lincoln Davis of Tennessee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400096" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us, I'm sure, have had an opportunity--at least most--to visit the war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. And being there, we have observed the greatness of the volunteers who volunteer their service for this great country and to help preserve, defend, and to bring about liberty and freedom to others in different parts of the world today, mainly in those two war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the third one in the area of the Balkans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as they serve, some give the ultimate sacrifice. And for all of those who serve and who have served, and for those who have given the ultimate sacrifice, we can never really do enough as a Nation to thank them for their service and, ultimately, leaving their families with the loss of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1775, a shot heard around the world brought American men and women into battle at the Siege of Boston that lasted through the spring of 1776, which eventually brought us into war for our independence. After several years and the loss of many lives, we obtained our independence. Since that time, our young men and women have been willing to volunteer to go into the battlefields to preserve the freedom that our first military men and women fought to give us, and we've been willing to preserve  that and we should continue as a Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think when we look at those who give the ultimate sacrifice, sometimes we give the medals and we show sympathy and appreciation to the families, and then after a while, we forget that. I know in every courthouse and every city hall there are monuments that have the names of those who have given their lives for this country and paid the ultimate sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Memorial Day we visit and Veterans Day we visit, perhaps some special days like 9/11 we again remember and we visit those who have their names engraved on the markings and on the monuments in our courthouses and city halls throughout this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But I believe that just those two or three special occasions are not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, I didn't realize how little we were showing appreciation for those who gave the ultimate sacrifice until my very first visit in early 2004 to Iraq. We had just traveled from one part of Iraq, flying back into Baghdad in a C-130. And before we boarded the plane, there was an escort detail. And we noticed that there was a casket, a flag-draped casket. A very solemn occasion as you looked at the lines of the young men and women who were saying farewell to the one who had given  his life. And they placed that in that cargo bay off the C-130. Those of us who were Members of Congress sat more to the front--those who have traveled obviously know that we ride the jump seats as we go in and out into Iraq or Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for some reason, when I looked in the faces of those young men who were the escorts, the solemn faces, the faces who weren't looking to anyone, I don't think, for sympathy, but just understanding, for me, on that occasion, I said, I don't think we do enough. And in 2004, I introduced this bill, the same one that's here today, to where we can at least once a month--12 times a year, plus the other occasions--say thank you to the mothers and fathers, to the brothers and sisters of the one who  gave his life, and to the one who gave his life, that America still cherishes, respects, loves and remembers the sacrifice that you gave to this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for me, it is my hope that this bill passes unanimously, and that we honor those who have given their life for this great Nation of ours.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman bringing this legislation forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of <bill type="hc" number="61">H. Con. Res. 61</bill>, "Expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States flag flown over the United States Capitol should be lowered to half-mast one day each month in honor of the brave men and women from the United States who have lost their lives in military conflicts." The brave men and women who have sacrificed their lives to protect not only the lives of Americans but democracy around the world, warrant a day each  month in which the Nation honors their service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 1 million brave men and women from the United States have died in military conflicts since the birth of our great Nation. It is the right of the American people to mourn the loss of the brave men and women who have given their lives for this country. All Americans must remember that our freedom has not come without sacrifice. The heroic men and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice, to protect our Nation and our freedom must be honored and recognized. As Gertrude Stein put it  so eloquently, "Silent gratitude isn't very much use to anyone."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paying tribute to the fearlessness and courageousness that the men and women from the United States have displayed throughout history, demonstrates the spirit of patriotism that is the foundation of our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="61">H. Con. Res. 61</bill> must be supported by the Members of Congress in order for us and all Americans to pay homage and show our respect for those extraordinary soldiers who are no longer with us, but whose legacies should live on. In honoring those who have fought for our country from the time of its conception would be a grand opportunity to show the men and women wearing the uniform today that their service is not in vain. It is an opportunity for America to demonstrate the magnitude of appreciation  that we hold in our hearts for the service and bravery of all our veterans. A simple gesture can demonstrate the immeasurable amount of gratitude which emanates through us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Texas alone is home to approximately 1,707,365 veterans. <bill type="hc" number="61">H. Con. Res. 61</bill> commemorates not only the valuable contribution of heroes past but to our present champions of freedom and democracy. I am reminded of something once said by author Melodie Beattie, "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos into order, confusion into clarity ..... it turns problems into gifts, failures into success, the unexpected  into perfect timing, and mistakes into important events. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow."</paragraph>
