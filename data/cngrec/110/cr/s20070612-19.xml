  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is a term that is often used here in the Senate when members refer to one another. That term is "gentleman." No one fit that term better than Senator Craig Thomas. I join with all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in mourning the loss of Senator Thomas, and in extending our condolences to his wonderful wife Susan and the entire Thomas family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 10 years I was privileged to serve with Senator Thomas in this Chamber, I never once heard him raise his voice, and I never once saw him lose his temper. But that doesn't mean that Senator Thomas was not a fighter for his beloved Wyoming. In fact, he was a very effective advocate for the people of Wyoming and all of rural America. His accomplishments were not the result of shouting. They were the result of perseverance, integrity, and a whole lot of hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was privileged to serve with Senator Thomas on a number of committees, where I saw firsthand the scope of his interests and his effectiveness. On the Finance Committee, I saw how he was a champion for better health care for rural Americans, and I saw how he worked to open markets for the cattlemen, farmers, and soda ash producers of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, he brought Wyoming's unique perspective to the forefront on the energy debate, and, as chairman and ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee, he brought the first reform overhaul to the National Parks Service in 20 years--a vital step in a State that is home to the Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of our park system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I served with Craig on the Indian Affairs committee, where the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes of Wyoming's Wild River Reservation and Native Americans across the country could always count on his commitment to improving their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Craig Thomas spent the last 18 years of his life working in the corridors of the U.S. Capitol, he never forgot where he came from. He was a true westerner, a straight-talker, and he was always just "Craig" to his constituents. Always at Craig's side was his wife and partner Susan, who is always a remarkable, eloquent advocate for Wyoming. The last several months have been difficult and challenging ones for Craig, and Susan was always there for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my wife Sharon joins with me in extending our condolences to Susan, the Thomas family, and the people of Wyoming. I can say without hesitation that the "gentleman from Wyoming" will always be remembered by those of us who were fortunate to serve with him, and by all those he served with such diligence and distinction.</paragraph>
