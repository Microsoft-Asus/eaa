  <narrative>VOTE "NO" ON THE U.S.-PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10738]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to encourage all of my colleagues to vote "no" on the Peru Free Trade Agreement. I just lost the third of four clothing factories in my district on Friday; hardworking men and women thrown out of work not because they couldn't do the job, but because they couldn't compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a responsibility as Members, whether you are Republican or Democrat, from whatever State you come from, to stand up for the American workers. I can't go back to my district and I will not go back to my district and try to explain to my workers who are losing their jobs, if you will just wait until we pass another trade deal that this President is not going to enforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to please vote "no" on the Peru Free Trade Agreement when it comes up. We can do much better, we owe it to our workers, and we will do much better.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
