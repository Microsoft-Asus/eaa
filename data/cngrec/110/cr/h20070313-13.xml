    <paragraph>A very simple proposition is facing this House; do we keep the war in Iraq going or do we end it? Do we use the money to bring the troops home or do we use the money to keep them in Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lives of our troops are on the line. The war cannot be won militarily. Why do we stay? Why do we tell our troops to keep fighting? Who is going to explain to the families of the troops the consequences of Congress' decision? And why isn't our Democratic Party taking the leadership to immediately end the war? We can do it. We don't have to give the administration another $120 billion to keep the war going. We don't have to let more troops die and have more civilian casualties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill>, provides a path to bringing our troops home, ending the occupation, closing our bases and stops the occupation of Iraq. We do not have to keep funding this war. The money is in the pipeline to bring the troops home. Let's end the war, bring the troops home, and bring in international peacekeepers to stabilize Iraq. We can do it once we end the occupation.</paragraph>
