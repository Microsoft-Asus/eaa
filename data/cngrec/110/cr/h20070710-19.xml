    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 483 was introduced by our colleague from Texas, Representative CIRO RODRIGUEZ. And I know that Representative Rodriguez wanted to be here today in the Chamber as we speak to this legislation but has been caught in the storms outside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="483">H. Res. 483</bill> recognizes the 63rd anniversary of Big Bend National Park in west Texas and honors the National Park Service for their service to the Big Bend region and Big Bend National Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Representative Rodriguez for his efforts to bring congressional recognition to this special place and to the agency and hardworking employees who care for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Bend National Park is a spectacular 800,000-acre scenic treasure on the Rio Grande in west Texas. The park protects the largest representative example of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem within the United States. The park's river, desert and mountain environments support an extraordinary richness of biologic diversity, including unique plants and animals that exist nowhere else in the world. The park provides outstanding recreation opportunities to over 300,000 visitors a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Bend is not only nationally significant but also internationally significant. Big Bend National Park manages nearly one-quarter of the approximately 1,000-mile stretch of the Rio Grande River that also serves as the boundary between the United States and Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together with two Mexican protected areas, Big Bend is now part of the largest transboundary protected areas in North America, serving as a model for international cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 483 recognizes the importance of Big Bend National Park to the ecology, history and economy of west Texas. It also recognizes the hard work of the National Park Service and its employees and honors their service to the region and the country as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority has adequately explained this resolution. We join with them in recognizing the 63rd anniversary of Big Bend National Park and hope this occasion will further highlight the need to secure our public lands from the ecological devastation caused by unfettered, illegal crossers and drug traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="483">H. Res. 483</bill>, to recognize the anniversary of Big Bend National Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-three years ago the State of Texas bestowed the 800,000 acres of pristine desert and mountain terrain that now make up the Big Bend National Park upon the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Bend began as a small State park, but in 1942, just following the Great Depression, Texas purchased 600,000 acres of land from private landowners at the price of $1.5 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost was high at the time, but Texas donated the land to the Federal Government for the establishment of a national park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that gesture, the State of Texas provided the Nation and its citizens with a majestic national park that has been enjoyed for over a half a century so far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution pays tribute not only to the picturesque landscape of the park itself, but to those who made it possible to preserve this land for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everett Ewing Townsend, known as the father of Big Bend National Park, was the champion of this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1894 Townsend traveled to the Chisos Mountains and later recalled that the breathtaking southern view from the mountains made him "see God as he had never seen Him before."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He vowed to preserve the region in some way, and 63 years later we can see that he has made good on his promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His efforts, first in the State Legislature and later as the Commissioner of the national park, provided the United States with an unspoiled tract of land that has since been enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Bend National Park, encompassing the region where the Chihuahuan Desert intersects with the Chisos Mountains features a distinct landscape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The park is surrounded on the south by the mighty Rio Grande.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The outer boundary is marked by the area where the flow of the river shifts from southeast to northeast, forming the giant bend after which the park is named.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With river, mountain and desert all in one, Big Bend National Park could easily be considered three parks in one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, west Texas is fortunate to have such a diverse environment preserved within the boundaries of one awe-inspiring park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The establishment of Big Bend National Park in 1944 allowed the vast expanse of land to be conserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, it protected the rich history of the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native people have inhabited the area for thousands of years, and in more recent years diverse groups of people have traversed the Big Bend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past century and a half Spanish explorers, Comanche Indians, Mexican settlers and American ranchers have all traveled through or lived within the park's terrain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, this important resolution recognizes the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of  Big Bend National Park and the people who made their way through the region well before then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="483">H. Res. 483</bill> also honors the National Park Service for their work in the Big Bend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we recognize Big Bend National Park's contributions to our Nation as well as the contribution that the park's founders and staff have made to the land since then.</paragraph>
