  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9003">S9003</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we are trying to work things out here. It has been very difficult. At this stage, it appears that the vote on cloture on the Coburn package will be vitiated. We will not have that vote tonight or in the morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now waiting to see if we can work out an agreement on the extenders. This has been something that the chairman of the committee has worked on all day, and it has been very difficult. We thought we had it worked out on a couple different occasions, and we did not. We now are told that one Senator who had a problem with it is reading the new language. We hope that can be done fairly quickly. That being the case, we will be back and report to the Senate again, hopefully in the next half hour  or so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
