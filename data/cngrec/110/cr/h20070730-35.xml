    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over 42 million children participate in youth sports all across our country, and their activities contribute greatly to their positive development and enrich the quality of life for all. There are a number of benefits reaped by children's involvement in sports, such as better grades, excellent interpersonal skills and a healthier lifestyle. Also, given the increasing numbers of children battling obesity, this is an important time for youth to become active  in sports.</paragraph>

This legislation would raise awareness of the important physical and emotional benefits of participating in youth sports and the need to promote fun, sportsmanship, and character development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative MIKE MCINTYRE for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
