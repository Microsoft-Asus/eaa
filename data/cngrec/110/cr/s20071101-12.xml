  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of <bill type="s" number="2184">S. 2184</bill>, a bill to allow penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans for individuals called to active duty, and that the bill be read a third time and passed. I further ask that the bill then be held at the desk until the House companion arrives and that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted, and the House bill, as amended, be read  a third time and passed.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am wondering whether the Senator would amend his consent request to allow, instead, the following; namely, that when the Senate receives from the House its bill to extend the expiring tax provisions, the Senate would proceed to that bill, consider a Baucus amendment to extend the expiring tax provisions and prevent the AMT from hitting any additional taxpayers, agree to that amendment, and pass the bill, all without any intervening action  or debate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Does the Senator from Oklahoma so modify his request?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>No. I would respond to the Senator by saying, if I had a chance to get and look at the Baucus bill and look at all the provisions, I might consider doing it. As it is right now, this is my unanimous consent request.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Montana.</chair>

    <paragraph>Hearing the comments of my good friend from Oklahoma, I have no alternative but to object.</paragraph>
