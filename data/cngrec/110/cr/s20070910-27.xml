    <paragraph>Mr. President, an important anniversary will be marked on September 14, at the Library of Congress. Twenty years ago, in the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building, then-President Reagan presided over the swearing-in of Dr. James H. Billington as the 13th Librarian of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he was appointed, Dr. Billington brought great expertise to the Library, both as the world's premier scholar of Russian culture and history and as director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. His vision, and the hard work of so many dedicated Library staff members, has led to continued growth of the Library of Congress. He has fulfilled the promise made on September 14, 1987--to make the riches of the Library more broadly available to ever widening circles of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time, Senator Wendell Ford remarked that the Library of Congress "represents our nation's commitment to a knowledgeable citizenry." Dr. Billington has upheld that commitment by enhancing the Library and making its riches and inspiration available to all Americans. Under his leadership, the Copyright Office, the Law Library, the Congressional Research Service, and the National Library have seamlessly worked together to build the collections and preserve them for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Library's accomplishments of the last two decades are extraordinary. The collections have expanded by 50 million items, and state-of-the art facilities have been built to ensure their long-term preservation. The establishment of the Kluge Center for Scholars and the Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences have enriched not only the scholarly life of Washington but also have enabled Members of Congress to meet thought leaders and benefit from their perspectives. Also, the  Library was a pioneer in online collections and services, launching American Memory, THOMAS, the World Digital Library and resources for teachers, students and families across the Nation and world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Library's pioneering work in education has had a great impact in my home State of Illinois. The Library's educational mission, shaped by Dr. Billington's vision, is that young people benefit from learning with primary sources such as Lincoln's magnificent Gettysburg Address, seeing the Founding Father's notes and revisions to the Bill of Rights, and exploring maps and sound recordings to understand history and culture firsthand. As the Library developed and focused its massive resources in  ways that teachers could explore and use for their classrooms, Dr. Billington recognized the profound impact of incorporating primary sources into teacher education. Many of us in Congress recognized the potential around this idea and helped create and fund the Adventures of the American Mind, which is now poised to become a national program--Teaching</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Billington's energy is unflagging. He has led efforts to launch the World Digital Library, the reinstallation of Thomas Jefferson's Library in the Jefferson Building, and the Library's celebration of the Lincoln Bicentennial in 2009 and beyond. In short, I have valued and look forward to continuing leadership from Dr. Billington. He and his colleagues at the Library of Congress are a tremendous resource to our work as a legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Library of Congress has benefited immeasurably from the first 20 years of Jim Billington's leadership. We are grateful to him and congratulate him, his wife Marjorie, and his family on this milestone of service to our Nation.</paragraph>
