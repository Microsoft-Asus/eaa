  <narrative>FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT -- (Senate - February 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="880">S880</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the order before the Senate allows me and the Republican leader 10 minutes any time during this debate to make a presentation. I will do that later. I do want to say, based on the remarks of the distinguished Republican leader, I, too, appreciate the work of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, but I also appreciate the work done by the Judiciary Committee and Senator Leahy. As a result of that work, the bill has already been made better and,  hopefully, we can adopt some of these amendments today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, for example, have as a result of the work done by the Judiciary Committee a compromise reached on a number of amendments that have made this bill better, including a Feingold amendment providing Congress with FISA Court documents that will facilitate congressional oversight and enable Congress to better understand the court's interpretation of the laws we passed; a Whitehouse amendment giving the FISA Court the discretion to stay lower FISA Court decisions pending appeal rather than requiring  a stay; a Kennedy amendment providing that under the new authority provided by this bill the Government may not intentionally acquire communications when it knows ahead of time that the sender and all intended recipients are in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has been made better. The bill that Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond did is not a bill that is perfect in nature, and I hope they will acknowledge that point. The bill has been made better as a result of work done by the Judiciary Committee. We have members of the Intelligence Committee who also serve on the Judiciary Committee. Two who come to my mind are Senator Feinstein and Senator Whitehouse. They have worked very hard in the Intelligence  Committee and the Judiciary Committee to improve this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should understand where we are. We are now doing different wiretaps, and I think the situation today that is so concerning to most of us is the President has been advised by his lawyers that he does not have to follow the law anyway. Whatever we do here, he has been told by his lawyers that he need not follow the law. He can do whatever he wants; he is the boss; he is someone who does not have to follow the law, does not even have to give a signing statement saying he rejects it. He can just  go ahead and do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not think this should be a day of celebration. This should be a day of concern for the American people. I am very happy we have been able to improve the product that came out of the Intelligence Committee. Hopefully, by the voting today we can improve it more.</paragraph>
