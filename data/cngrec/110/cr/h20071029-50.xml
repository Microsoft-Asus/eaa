  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tonight this House passed House Resolutions 740, 573 and 726 with regard to Darfur and Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, decades from now our children's children will look back on these times as an ugly blemish on human history. They will remember a time when innocent people were senselessly slaughtered in the Darfur region of Sudan. The question is whether they will look back and see that this Nation and this Congress stood up for what is right and just, or did we sit idly by and watch from the sidelines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must be on the right side of this issue. That's why I'm so glad that we have passed these resolutions today. Although much work remains to be done, they represent a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of these bills rightfully pressures the Sudanese Government to end civil strife and ongoing human rights violations in Darfur, which threatens stability in the region and the very fabric of Sudanese life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Madam Speaker, Darfur remains in great peril. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have lost their lives since the conflicts spiraled out of control in February of 2003. Over 2 million civilians have been internally displaced, and an estimated 215,000 more persons have been externally displaced in such neighboring states as Chad. Even for those who are internally displaced persons, they have experienced anything but a safe haven outside of Darfur while ongoing killing, torture, rape,  looting and the unlawful destruction of their property by all parties continues, mainly by the janjaweed, associated militia groups, and the institution that should be protecting them, the Sudanese Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, as House Resolution 726 points out, it has become treacherous for women or young ladies in Darfur or eastern Chad to leave their villages to collect firewood or food from the market. They are at risk of being raped and assaulted, which, unfortunately, to date is exactly what has occurred to thousands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although some strides have been made in reducing the government's participation in continued human rights abuses in Darfur, militia groups remain a very real and present threat for the civilians in Darfur and eastern Chad, despite peace negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Particularly, as reported by the United Nations, these systematic human rights violations have been and continue to be committed with total impunity throughout Sudan, especially in Darfur. It is clear that the Government of Sudan has taken to turning a blind eye to such atrocities, choosing instead to provide strikingly few prosecutions, sentencing or even adequate examinations of war crimes or crimes against humanity, whether by criminal courts or those courts established to investigate the  violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These failures by the Sudanese Government to respect and abide by customary international norms, international humanitarian and human rights laws embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Geneva Conventions and the Convention on the Rights of a Child that it is a party to demonstrates a lack of respect for international law and responsibility that it has to protect its citizenry from unacceptable levels of abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, this Bush administration has held tightly to a hands-off approach by failing to send any troops to Sudan, despite there clearly being a lack of an adequate and capable number of African Union troops, amounting to a mere 7,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President promised to not allow another Rwanda-style atrocity to occur; however, it appears to be happening once again, with little being done about it. Even the peace negotiations that recently occurred in Libya appear to be faltering, with two key militia groups failing to show up for the meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As such, I congratulate my colleagues in passing these three vital resolutions this evening. And I thank the Congress, which has chosen to answer the pleas for help by the people of Darfur while the administration has failed to adequately respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must act with a great sense of urgency. History will judge whether we have synchronized our conduct with our conscience.</paragraph>
