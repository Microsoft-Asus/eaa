    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill>) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of establishing the Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area in the States of Washington and Oregon, and for other purposes, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill>, sponsored by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird), would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of designating a national heritage area in western Washington State. Specifically, the study would examine coastal areas in Clatsop and Pacific Counties at the mouth of the Columbia River, as well as inland areas along the river in two adjacent counties. The bill includes standard criteria for national heritage area  studies, and requires completion of the study 3 years after the date funds are made available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the area included in this proposed study is not only beautiful, but is rich in Native American and European history. The area was a busy stop on European trade routes many years before Lewis and Clark famously visited the west coast. Representative Baird is to be commended for his hard work on behalf of this legislation. We look forward to working with him on the designation of a national heritage area should the study support such an action.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> for both procedural and substantive reasons. I am very dismayed that this bill has been  rushed to the floor with no hearing or subcommittee or full committee consideration by the Committee on Natural Resources. The majority might say a hearing was held on the bill last September, and no opposition was present so there is no need for consideration by the committee this year; but I strongly disagree  with this logic for several reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the committee has received a strong letter of opposition to <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> by one of the largest private property rights groups, the American Land Rights Association, based in Battleground, Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That letter states: "We are curious why no hearings have been held on this bill during this Congress. Congress has the time and energy to congratulate victorious sports teams, but does not have the time and resources to hold a hearing on this bill which affects millions of acres of private property in Washington and Oregon."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I note that one-eighth of the Members of this body, including me, are new Members of the House and were unable to participate in hearings held in the last Congress on this bill. Although there might be some cases where a consensus bill from the last Congress could justifiably be forwarded to the House for expedited consideration on the floor, this bill should not be one of them. As I said previously, it is strongly opposed by a private rights based group in the area affected by the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The substantive reasons to oppose this bill can best be summarized by the American Land Rights Association's May 3, 2007, letter to the Committee on Natural Resources which states: "Although <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> is billed merely as a study, history shows the National Park Service rarely does a study that concludes a national heritage area is not feasible. Recent history also shows that national heritage areas cost the National Park Service $10 million during their 15-year life span. Moreover, once their  15-year authorization expires, heritage area proponents come back to Congress asking for even more Federal moneys so they can ultimately become self-sufficient. At a time when the National Park Service has a multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog for such basic visitor services as campgrounds, visitor centers and sanitation facilities, it should not be forced by Congress to create expensive new heritage areas that siphon precious Federal dollars from these higher and better uses."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the letter I just referred to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ASSOCIATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Battle Ground, WA, May 3, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN RAHALL AND CONGRESSMAN YOUNG, The American Land Rights Association is headquartered is Southwest Washington State and is very involved with private property rights and land use issues here and throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand the House will soon consider <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill>, the Columbia-Pacific Heritage Area Study Act, which affects our members in this region. We are curious why no hearings have been held on this bill during this Congress. Congress has the time and energy to congratulate victorious sports teams but does not have the time and resources to hold a hearing on this bill that affects millions of acres of private property in Washington and Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> is billed as "merely as study," history shows the National Park Service rarely does a study that concludes a national heritage area is not feasible. Recent history also shows that national heritage areas cost the National Park Service $10 million dollars during their 15-year life span. Moreover, once their 15-year authorization expires, heritage area proponents come back to Congress asking for even more federal money so they can ultimately become "self sufficient." At a  time when the National Park Service has a multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog for such basic visitor services as campgrounds, visitor centers and sanitation facilities, it should not be forced by Congress to create expensive new heritage areas that siphon precious federal dollars for these higher and better uses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Land Rights Association respectfully requests the House Committee on Natural Resources hold a balanced hearing on <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> before bringing this bill to the House Floor. We are astonished with the sense of urgency to pass this bill so early in the new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chuck Cushman,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have stated publicly before, enacting legislation that actually works for the American people requires thoughtfulness and dialogue so all options are on the table. To reject that just because a numerical majority is available does a tremendous disservice to the American people. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="AMERICAN LAND RIGHTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would first point out that almost identical legislation, <bill type="h" number="5485">H.R. 5485</bill>, was the subject of a subcommittee hearing in the Resources Committee during the previous Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During that hearing, the Bush administration and local business leaders expressed support for the legislation. That hearing, organized by then-Republican majority, featured no testimony opposing the bill. Further, the companion to this bill was sponsored by the Republican Senator from Oregon. Given that bipartisan and noncontroversial legislative history, and the fact that the bill simply authorizes a study, it is perfectly appropriate that the measure be before the House today. We have used  similar procedures to bring other measures left over from the previous Congress to the floor, measures sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one organization mentioned as opposing the bill failed to make their opposition known to the committee or the sponsor, nor did they testify at last year's hearing. Further, the group has no real relevance because it opposes all heritage area study proposals on ideological, rather than substantive, grounds which have nothing to do with this specific proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, this legislation simply authorizes a study, not a national heritage area. To oppose the study because you assume you will oppose what the study will recommend is premature at best. There is no real controversy regarding this legislation, and we urge our colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill>, the Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area Study Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area Study Act is an important piece of legislation to my district and the entire Pacific Northwest. I have been privileged to work with David Wu from Oregon in introducing this legislation. In the Senate, the companion legislation has been introduced by Senator Gordon Smith from Oregon and is supported by Washington Senators Murray and Cantwell, as well as Oregon Senator Ron Wyden. Hence, this legislation has  both bipartisan and bicameral support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mouth of the Columbia is a special place with a very rich history. Native American communities have flourished there for thousands of years. It is home to the first American settlement on the Pacific, Astoria. It served as a major trading post for European, American, Chinese, and other nations' ships, and earned its nickname the "Graveyard of the Pacific" from the hundreds of shipwrecks along its dangerous coast. Lewis and Clark ended their westward trek there in 1805. Today, the area is  home to the fishing, seafood processing, and timber communities that embody the Pacific Northwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing a national heritage area at the mouth of the river is fitting in recognition of the region and its importance historically. As you know, the national heritage area unites parts of historically and culturally significant areas under a common purpose. In this  case, it will help continue the cooperative efforts that the Lewis and Clark bicentennial helped to create. The bicentennial commemoration helped bring community interests together to  plan and work in a collaborative fashion. A national heritage area will continue this momentum and ensure the region continues to attract families, outdoorsmen and women, history buffs, and others to enhance its sustainable tourism economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most impressive is that the effort to create a national heritage area at the mouth of the Columbia is really an idea driven by the local community. We have received letters of support from local governments, local businesses, trade associations, chambers of commerce, ports and others who have heard about this effort and wholeheartedly endorsed it. A brief sample of support includes the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Office of the Governor of Oregon, the city of Astoria,  Shorebank Pacific Bank, Cannon Beach Chamber of Commerce, the Port of Peninsula, and the Clatsop County Historical Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the prior Congress, the legislation was subject to an oversight hearing in the National Parks Subcommittee where the administration expressed their support for the bill. We were also joined by small business owners from the area, notably Bob Andrews, who expressed his particular support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the National Resource Committee chairman, Nick Rahall; the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands chairman, Mr. Grijalva; and their staffs, including David Watkins and Rick Healy, for their work in bringing this to the floor. I would also like to thank Marc Korman in my office for his work on this important legislation. And especially, my dear friend, David Wu. Again, I thank the Chair for bringing this  to the floor and urge final passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the creation of a Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area. I have worked closely with my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird), to introduce <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> to study the feasibility of a national heritage area at the mouth of the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the river itself, the journey to get to where we are has been lengthy. In 2001, I took the initial steps with Mr. Baird and with the help of the National Resources Committee and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder), and we were able to expand Fort Clatsop National Historic Monument and extend it to the sea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, Congressman Baird and I together created Oregon's and Washington's newest national park, the Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks. No one person could have accomplished the many steps to this point. I thank the hard work of the Natural Resources Committee, Congressmen Baird and Souder, Oregon State Senator Betsy Johnson and former park superintendent Chip Jenkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would especially like to thank all of the local citizens, such as Astoria's Cindy Mudge who has put tremendous time and effort into the heritage area. The history that shaped this part of our Nation should be preserved and celebrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here, where the Columbia, the great river of the West, meets the ocean, strong men and women have left their indelible imprint for millennia. Native cultures, such as the Clatsop Nehalem, Chinook and other Indian tribes, were joined by the Spanish, Russians and British. Lewis and Clark began an American tie to the river, and Americans of diverse descent, including Americans of Scandinavian, Chinese and other heritages, together built the history of the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the way that America was or should be, a close-knit community where everyone, from the Indians to Lewis and Clark to Scandinavians to Chinese, were and are welcome; where work, and not parentage, determines one's worth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From forestry to fisheries, the land and waters have provided. Today, human hands provide for the future. We are trying to build a college to help create the education and research-based economy of the future. Here also are the helping hands of the Columbia River bar pilots who since 1846 have guided ships across the Columbia River bar, and the United States Coast Guard, who faithfully protect local and international commerce on the roughest, toughest water in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mouth of the Columbia River presents layers of history and culture like an ancient buried city, except that the river rolls on today. Unlike the Hudson or the Mississippi, we do not have a large city at the river's mouth to preserve its stories and heritage; an act of Congress shall do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="407">H.R. 407</bill> and note that the opposition which has been expressed comes from an organization which is not within the historic study area.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="AMERICAN LAND RIGHTS">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just like to correct the record of the gentleman from Colorado. I know a little bit about Colorado myself. I have lived there. I doubt the gentleman from Colorado has lived in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do happen to know that Battleground, Washington, is not anywhere near the affected area. The affected area encompasses Pacific County and Wahkiakum County on my side of the river, two counties on the gentleman from Oregon's side of the river. Battleground is not there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as the massive size of this organization you describe, it is not so large. I appreciate they have a voice. I am happy to listen to the voice. This Congress should listen to the voice. But it should not overwhelm the unanimous sense of the people who sponsored this legislation. The committee jurisdiction has had a hearing on this, and I do not think we want to make it the practice of this body, we certainly never have before, to say that every time a relatively noncontroversial bill has  been heard well out in the prior Congress, we have to have another hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the gentleman pretends to say that it is his concern that we try to save the taxpayers' money, having continuous, multiple hearings every time a bill does not quite pass out both bodies, both the House and the Senate, from one Congress to the next, I think it would actually cost the taxpayers a lot more money than you would hope to save.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me speak to the substance of this. My friend from Oregon said it well. If you know the history of this great country and if you know the history of the Pacific Northwest, there can be no doubt that this area warrants designation such as we think this study will ultimately lend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend mentioned Lewis and Clark. Prior to them, the historical trade that went along among the native tribes at the mouth of the Columbia River was legendary. Lewis and Clark, the first American settlement in the Pacific Northwest, the key to trade with Asia in the early years of this great country, it was this mouth of this river where the first northwest settlement of the United States by Americans expanded. The mouth of this river is a key to the commerce, not only of the Pacific Northwest  but the inland Northwest, the greater Northwest where great quantities of grain and other cargos are shipped out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This region has a rich cultural, historical legacy that we need to honor and respect and preserve. That is why the administration supports this bill. That is why our friend and colleague in the other body, Senator Smith, supports this bill. That is why we have I think the unanimous support of both delegations. This should be a noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Colorado I think has raised rather specious arguments against it, and I think we should pass this fine legislation and move forward with honoring a very richly deserving part of this country with this designation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me thank the sponsors, Congressman Baird and Congressman Wu, for this fine legislation and to remind our colleagues that this is the beginning of a process for a designation. This is the study process, and it is noncontroversial. And as mentioned before, the organization opposing it has a protected record of opposing any heritage area, without any substantive qualification to that opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
