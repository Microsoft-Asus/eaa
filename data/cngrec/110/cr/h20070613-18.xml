  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just how bad do things have to get at the Justice Department before congressional Republicans say enough is enough?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, Senate Democrats tried to bring up a vote of no confidence in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. While seven Republicans supported an effort to allow for an up-or-down vote, the rest of the Senate Republican Caucus blocked it procedurally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are my Republican colleagues serious? Do they actually believe, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that this Attorney General can continue to serve as the Nation's leading law enforcement officer?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not forget that Gonzales still does not remember why he fired eight U.S. attorneys last year. Nor should we forget that Gonzales tried to pressure then-Attorney General Ashcroft into signing off on the secret telephone surveillance program while Ashcroft sat in a hospital bed preparing for surgery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats are restoring real accountability to Washington, but it would be nice if we could get a little help from our Republican friends.</paragraph>
