  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, these are very difficult times for the American economy and America's working families. For most of the past 2 weeks, the headlines have been dominated by news of Wall Street's financial meltdown. But our Nation's economic woes stretch far beyond financial institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are watching the fluctuations in the stock market; they see investment banks failing and the values of their own 401(k) accounts and money market funds decline. Gas is still hovering near $4 a gallon, their grocery and heating bills continue to skyrocket, and yet their wages remain stagnant. Millions of families do not know how they will make ends meet this winter. While they believe that something must be done to fix the problems in the credit markets, they need and expect  us to help them too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a week since the President sent to Capitol Hill a three-page bill asking for unprecedented authority to increase the American people's debt even further--to $11.3 trillion--and to use that money solely to purchase troubled assets from failing financial institutions, while demanding no accountability from their executives. It is no surprise that the American people have solidly rejected that plan. Bewildered, they ask Congress, "Where is the help for my family, for my community?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week bipartisan efforts on the bailout continue in the Senate and House. We are working to craft a responsible plan to guarantee strong oversight of the system that created this disaster, limit exorbitant executive compensation and bonuses on Wall Street, and restore confidence in our markets. But we also recognize that much more must be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Majority Leader Reid and Appropriations Chairman Byrd have developed a thoughtful, comprehensive package that will begin to help our entire Nation recover. Regrettably, yesterday 42 Republicans rejected efforts to provide help beyond Wall Street. By voting against the motion to proceed, they denied the Senate the opportunity to even debate a plan for Americans' personal economic recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most recent statistics on employment and inflation reveal why their choice was wrong and why an immediate and forceful response is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unemployment rate stands at 6.1 percent the highest rate since September 2003. This bill would have extended unemployment benefits by 7 weeks for all States and by an additional 13 weeks in high unemployment States, and it would have provided $300 million for employment and training activities for dislocated workers. These funds would have helped more than 79,000 people receive training, and job search and career counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 2 years, food costs have increased by nearly 15 percent. This bill would provide an additional $50 million for food banks and $60 million for senior meals program, increase food stamp benefits by 10 percent and add $450 million for the WIC Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy prices are up by nearly 40 percent in the past 2 years. This bill would have added $5.1 billion for low-income home energy assistance programs and $500 million to help make low-income homes for energy efficient through weatherization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of State governments are in dire economic straits. My home State of Maryland faces a $1 billion shortfall for the next fiscal year, and cuts in programs and services are already being planned. This bill would have boosted state coffers by providing a 4-percent increase in Federal help for State health care programs and $1.2 billion extra for the National Institutes of Health, NIH, headquartered in Bethesda, MD. This bill would have allowed NIH to award 3,300 new research grants to  help discover new treatments and cures for devastating diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreclosure rates are at the highest in our country's history and home values are plummeting. This bill included $37.5 million for the Legal Services Corporation to help families whose homes are in foreclosure, $52 million for the FHA to bolster its staff and resources to ensure that its mortgage fund remains solvent, $250 million to help public housing agencies rehabilitate vacant rental units, and $200 million to help families in rental housing who are displaced by foreclosure find safe, affordable  places to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wall Street meltdown has vastly reduced the availability of credit for our small businesses and endangered the survival of many businesses. This bill would have provided $200 million to support reduced-fee loans to small businesses and $5 million to support microloans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The defeat of the cloture vote today truly represents a missed opportunity  to answer Americans' call for aid. I want to commend Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Byrd for their work in crafting this much needed bill. I would hope that before this Congress adjourns, we will have the opportunity to debate and pass this necessary measure.</paragraph>
