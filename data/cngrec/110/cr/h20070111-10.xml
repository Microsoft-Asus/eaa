    <paragraph>President Bush has been wrong at every step along the descent into chaos in Iraq, and he is wrong once again. The terrible price for his repeated miscalculations is paid for by the blood of the brave, by hundreds of billions of dollars squandered and by greater insecurity for our families. He has no new plan, just an old delusion. This isn't a surge. It is a costly, long-term escalation that only endangers more young Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apparently the only troops he will bring home are the many generals who disagree with him. He has rejected the advice of the Iraq Study Group. He has rejected military counsel. He has rejected the voices of the people and their elected representatives. And we must firmly reject his escalation of what can only be called a spend-and-bleed policy.</paragraph>
