  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the majority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans controlling the next 30 minutes. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>, the Defense authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, the Senate reached an agreement to consider several amendments to the bill, including amendments by Senators LEAHY, VITTER, NELSON of Florida, and KYL. Those amendments will be debated this morning, and we will work with the two managers of the bill and with my counterpart, Senator McConnell, to find out when those votes should take place. We are hopeful we can continue working on this most important legislation today and complete the legislation this  week. It would be really good if we could do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if the distinguished Republican leader wouldn't mind, I wish to yield a couple of minutes to the Senator from Nebraska, and then Senator McConnell would have the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.</chair>
