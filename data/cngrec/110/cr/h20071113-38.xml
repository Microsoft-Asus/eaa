    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca).</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. BACA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman who is working on this for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise tonight to honor Beatrice "Bea" Watson, a woman who dedicated her life to her community and to democracy. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from California for supporting this legislation on a bipartisan basis. Bea Watson died on August 5 at the age of 83. My bill, <bill type="h" number="3569">H.R. 3569</bill>, would designate the Santa Ana Avenue post office in Fontana, California, to be named in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, Bea Watson, was a distinguished member of the Fontana community. Bea strove to make a positive difference in her hometown, a positive role model, and was an inspiration to all she came in contact with, and she led by example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In over 45 years of life in Fontana, she served as an elected city councilmember, clerk, historical society officer, women's club president, chamber of commerce member, and organized many events such as parades and festivals in Fontana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bea was also recognized for her outstanding achievement and loved by all her community for her contributions to the Fontana community. Through her life, she received over 22 prestigious community awards, including the Fontana PTA Council Award, the Chamber of Commerce Outstanding Volunteer Award, the Community Spirit Award, and the California Legislature Woman of the Year Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Bea was so loved by the community that she was given the title of "Mrs. Fontana" or "Busy Bea" in the City of Fontana. Her efforts have touched the lives of her neighbors and her impact on the community will create a lasting legacy for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a volunteer, as a public servant and as a friend of her community, Bea proved herself to be an exemplary American. She was an excellent example of the meaning of volunteerism, and the quality of life in Fontana is better because she cared and gave so much of herself knowing that it would be a better place for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although now gone, she will continue to serve as an inspiration to us all. It is with great honor that I ask Members of Congress to designate the post office in California's 43rd Congressional District as the Beatrice Watson Post Office. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the 53 Members from California who signed on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ex-Fontana Councilwoman Bea Watson Dies</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Mary Bender)</narrative>
  <narrative>Former City Clerk and Councilwoman Bea Watson, a tireless community volunteer who organized the city's Christmas and Fontana Days parades, died Sunday and will be remembered in a funeral service Monday.</narrative>
  <narrative>She was 83.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mrs. Watson was elected to two terms as Fontana city clerk, completing her eight years in office in December. She also served one term as a city councilwoman, from 1992 to 1996, losing her re-election bid to Manuel Mancha by 68 votes.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Bea was a citizen who truly cared for this community," said Linda Nunn, Fontana's deputy city clerk. "She will truly be missed."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mrs. Watson, who had been ill for three months, died of congestive heart failure at Legacy Rehabilitation Center in San Bernardino, according to Monica Bentley, her granddaughter.</narrative>
  <narrative>She is survived by her husband, Larry Watson, a production specialist for KFON Channel 3, the city's government access station that airs meetings of the Fontana City Council and Planning Commission.</narrative>
  <narrative>Other survivors include her daughter, Patricia Bentley, of Fontana, her brother, Fay Allen, of San Bernardino, her sister, Marguerite Botsford, of Fontana, Monica Bentley and another granddaughter, and a great-grandson.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mrs. Watson's successor, City Clerk Tonia Lewis, said she would recruit friends and colleagues to help out with civic events. "It's hard to fill her shoes because she was so active in everything," Lewis said. "She didn't take no for an answer."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mrs. Watson didn't let her ailments slow her down. "Toward the end, she was so sick and so bent over," Lewis said.</narrative>
  <narrative>"She had a hard time getting around. She shuffled and it never stopped her," Lewis said. "She just kept going, like the Energizer Bunny."</narrative>
  <narrative>One of Mrs. Watson's passions was the Fontana Historical Society, which was established in 1974 but in recent years needed an infusion of volunteers to replace its aging roster.</narrative>
  <narrative>"She got me involved with the Historical Society because the society was failing for lack of membership. She hated to see things fail, so she would gather together people she knew who could handle those things," Lewis said. "We had no choice."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mrs. Watson was active in several other local organizations and events, including the Fontana Woman's Club, the Fontana Exchange Club; American Legion Auxiliary, Post 772; and the Fontana Chamber of Commerce.</narrative>
  <narrative>She served on committees to commemorate Fontana's 50th and 75th anniversary celebrations, and organized the city's annual Community Prayer Breakfast since 1990. She also was an active volunteer for the Fontana Days Festival, the annual summer celebration of the city's 1913 founding by A.B. Miller, and organized the city's annual Festival of Winter.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The Christmas parade was her baby. She felt like she was doing it for the kids in Fontana," Lewis said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Born July 1, 1924, in Ashtabula, Ohio, Mrs. Watson came West in 1944, living in San Bernardino before moving to Fontana. She attended San Bernardino Valley College and was a retired telephone company administrator with Pacific Bell.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my fellow colleague from California in support of <bill type="h" number="3569">H.R. 3569</bill>, a bill to name the post office on Santa Ana Avenue in Fontana after Beatrice "Bea" E. Watson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was truly a pillar of the community and well-recognized in Fontana. As my colleague said, the California delegation uniquely requires 53 cosponsors in order to bring a bill. That means that a very diverse State, the most diverse in the Nation, has to come together on these post office namings. This is an example when we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bea dedicated her life to the community and in every sense was in fact a true Californian, although in fact, like myself, she was born in Ohio and came to California at age 20. She originally moved to San Bernardino where she attended the San Bernardino Community College. She then worked for the telephone company as an administrator for Pacific Bell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only years later did she arrive in Fontana. Nevertheless, her dedication allowed her to become truly a pillar of the community, a city councilwoman, and to serve in various capacities for the rest of her life, through both Fontana's 50th and 75th anniversaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not lightly that we consider naming post offices after people not in the postal community, and I join with my colleague today and the California delegation unanimously urging passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
