  <speaking speaker="400049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House unanimously approved <bill type="hc" number="186">H. Con. Res. 186</bill>, which honors the 75th anniversary of Brookgreen Gardens, which is located in my district in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. I rise today to thank my colleagues for celebrating Brookgreen Gardens, which is one of the most beautiful places in coastal South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1931, Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington founded Brookgreen Gardens to preserve the native flora and fauna of coastal South Carolina and to display objects of art within that natural setting. Today, Brookgreen Gardens is a National Historic Landmark, and contains more than 550 works from American artists in what was the country's first public sculpture garden. Brookgreen Gardens also offers a natural exhibit center and a small zoo, which educates visitors on the unique species and issues of  coastal South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I would like to especially thank my colleagues from the South Carolina delegation that have shown bipartisan unity in cosponsoring this resolution, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the opening of Brookgreen Gardens.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
