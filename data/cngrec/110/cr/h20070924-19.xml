    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="605">H. Res. 605</bill>, a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Gold Star Mothers Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="605">H. Res. 605</bill>, which has 108 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative PETER ROSKAM on August 1, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="605">H. Res. 605</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007 by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Gold Star Mothers Day is an organization for mothers who have lost a son or daughter in service to our country. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt designated the last Sunday in September as Gold Star Mothers Day to recognize and commemorate the tremendous sacrifice these courageous mothers have endured on behalf of our Nation. This wonderful group of women have turned their personal tragedy into patriotism and public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, numerous chapters of Gold Star Mothers across our Nation offer important programs and services to improve the lives of veterans and their families. They assist veterans of the Armed Forces and their dependents in the presentation of claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the goals and ideals of Gold Star Mothers Day. And I have the utmost respect for mothers and fathers that have sacrificed their sons and daughters for peace, freedom and the security of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative PETER ROSKAM, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, applaud PETER ROSKAM of Illinois for his introduction of this resolution. He had every intention of being here, but unfortunately he missed his plane, so he is not able to make it at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War I, Grace Seibold's son, George, served with the British Royal Flying Corps in France. While on combat duty, he regularly sent letters home to his family in Washington, D.C. Around Christmas of 1918, the letters stopped and the Seibold family never heard from him again. Because his military unit was under British control, the U.S. had no information of his whereabouts or safety. After months of waiting, they received notice of his death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the war, Grace Seibold had been spending her time visiting with soldiers in military hospitals and providing solace and assistance with their recuperation. After her own son's death, she met with fellow mothers of soldiers who had been killed serving their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The women began to share their grief and quickly found support for each other. Their uncommon bond brought them closer and helped them to heal. The group also encouraged community service by volunteering at local hospitals for veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After years of careful planning, in June of 1928, 25 mothers joined in Washington, D.C. to form the American Gold Star Mothers, Incorporated. The mission of the organization is to honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and to assist veterans with processing claims made to the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The service provided by the Gold Star Mothers does not end there. They inspire patriotism and love of country. They promote peace and goodwill through annual special events. The Gold Star Mothers work in cooperation with all veterans organizations and lend their support giving many hours of volunteer work and personal service to veteran families. It is an organization that inspires community service, honor of country, and takes great pride in having our brave men and women serving in our Armed  Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to honor these brave women for their continued efforts and their tireless support of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will close by simply stating that I have a very active, passionate and involved chapter of Gold Star Mothers in my congressional district. And so on behalf of them, and all of the Gold Star Mothers and Fathers throughout the country, I would urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="605">H. Res. 605</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
