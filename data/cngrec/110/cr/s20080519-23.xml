    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Kenneth  L. Tyson for his dedication to the health care profession. Ken is a true leader, and his commitment to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is more than worthy of recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ken began his career at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in March 1965 as a medical technologist in the laboratory. He worked his way up the ranks and in 1990 was promoted to his current position, senior vice president of operations. Under his direction, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center has enjoyed a consistently prestigious record of contributions to the medical field. It is one of the largest hospitals in New Jersey and provides unique and highly specialized services including heart transplants,  kidney transplants, lung transplants, neonatal and pediatric critical care. For over 43 years, Ken has enjoyed a distinguished reputation among his peers within the New Jersey hospital industry, the Saint Barnabas Health Care System and the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ken Tyson is a 1965 graduate of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, with a bachelor of science in medical technology. He then earned a master's degree in business administration from the Rutgers Graduate School of Business in 1977. Ken also served his alma mater as an adjunct instructor in the medical technology program for 9 years and later taught clinical laboratory sciences at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey for over 19 years. He is currently affiliated with  the American College of Health Care Executives and the American Society of Clinical Pathology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ken has dedicated his long and illustrious career to improving health care services for the residents of New Jersey and beyond. On behalf of my home State, I am honored to express my gratitude and congratulations to Kenneth L. Tyson and extend my best wishes for a long and happy retirement with his wife Ophelia and his two children and four grandchildren.</paragraph>
