    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we approach September 11, all of us have memories of that fateful day. All of us recognize that in order for our Nation to be strong and to feel secure, that not only must we be in a position to protect ourselves, but we also must cultivate friendships and relationships throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I would hope as we memorialize those who gave their lives and lost their lives on September 11, that we will renew our efforts to try and make sure that we can create for ourselves and the rest of the world a more stable, peaceful environment and let that be the legacy of those who gave the last measure of devotion, their lives.</paragraph>
