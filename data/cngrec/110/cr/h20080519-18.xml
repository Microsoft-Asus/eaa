    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1464">H.R. 1464</bill>, the Great Cats and Rare Canids Act, was introduced by our colleague from New Mexico, Congressman Tom Udall. The overall purpose of <bill type="h" number="1464">H.R. 1464</bill> is to assist in the conservation of 15 imperiled cat and canid species, such as the lion, the cheetah, the jaguar, and the African wild dog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would establish a new Great Cat and Rare Canid Conservation Fund to finance Federal matching grants for critical conservation projects to conserve these endangered wildlife species and their scarce and shrinking habitats. This legislation mirrors other highly popular and effective laws authorizing funding to help conserve and recover rhinoceroses, tigers, African and Asian elephants, great apes, and marine turtles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Great cats and rare canids are no less deserving of greater conservation assistance than these other keystone wildlife species, and I ask Members on both sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1464">H.R. 1464</bill>, the Great Cats and Rare Canids Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to give tribute and credit and compliment to former Congressman Clay Shaw of Florida, who has long sponsored this legislation and in the previous Congress worked tirelessly to pass it. So today, as we pass this bill, I would like to remember our colleague, Clay Shaw, who in fact has recognized for a long time the need to make permanent the preservation of these large, and small, but  beautiful animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I would urge the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
