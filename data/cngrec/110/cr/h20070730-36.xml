    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on June 28, 2007, Mr. Craig Biggio is the 27th professional baseball player in major league history to make 3,000 base hits. He is the ninth to do so while playing all of his games with one team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, Mr. Biggio began his distinguished career with the Houston Astros as a catcher. In 1992, hoping to extend his career, the team moved him to various positions, first to the outfield, then to second base, where he is currently playing. He is the only player to be named an All-star as both catcher and second baseman. After playing baseball for 20 years, he has announced his retirement at the end of this season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative KEVIN BRADY for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
