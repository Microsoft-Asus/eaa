  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, later today I will introduce legislation, the Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act. And I will introduce that legislation with my good friend and former sheriff from Indiana, Congressman Ellsworth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before coming to Congress, I served 33 years in the King County Sheriff's Office. I have seen the pain on the faces of victims and victims families, unexplainable, unimaginable pain that covers their faces and their families for the rest of their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, unfortunately, criminals today who are in our State and Federal prisons are using their fame and notoriety to make a buck. The Internet has become a gateway to an industry coined as "murderabilia," where tangible goods owned and/or created by convicted murderers are sold for their profit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, on the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims, I'm privileged and honored to honor the memory of all victims. And my bill aims to shut down this business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
