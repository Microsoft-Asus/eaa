  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SANDER LURIE -- (Senate - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4100">S4100</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a truly remarkable person. Sander Lurie came to my office as legislative director in 2001, and was an integral member of my staff for 7 years, including serving as my chief of staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sander was pivotal in getting my office up and running as I made the transition from the U.S. House of Representatives to the U.S. Senate in 2001. I could not have asked for a better person to direct my legislative efforts; with his support I was able to hit the ground running and work for the great people of the State of Michigan from the very start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to joining my staff in 2001, Sander spent 10 years working for the honorable Senator from the State of New Jersey, Mr. Frank Lautenberg, including serving as his chief of staff prior to Senator Lautenberg's retirement in 2000. When I asked Senator Lautenberg about Sander and his contributions to his office, Senator Lautenberg told me, "Sander was an integral part of my team for many years and played a large role in our successes during that time. He  is a smart, natural leader with a real dedication to public service." I could not agree more. For the 7 years he spent on my staff no one was more tireless, more hardworking, or more dedicated to helping the citizens of Michigan and the citizens of the United States. He was a constant source of motivation and inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sander has always been the kind of person whose first priority is to improve the lives of those around him. This was clearly evident during his time in Senator Lautenberg's office. He was instrumental in assisting Senator Lautenberg's push for major reforms in tobacco and was very helpful to the state attorneys general who took on the tobacco industry. Sander played a key role in the Senator's successful battle to reduce drunken driving deaths by making the .08 blood alcohol  level the law of the land. Amidst all this, Sander was able to work with Senator Lautenberg and help craft the historic 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement that helped to produce the budget surpluses of the late 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he made his way to my office, Sander used his experience with the balanced budget agreement to become the go-to person on my staff regarding the budget, and all of us here in the Senate can attest to the complexity that comes along with it. Sander always prided himself in knowing the ins and outs of the budget process and he never ceased to amaze me with his ability to recall rules and regulations at will. His work and knowledge was a pivotal part of my ability to be a leader and contributor  to the budget committee, and I cannot thank him enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sander was born in Warwick, RI, and raised for most of his early life in Milwaukee, WI. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and following that he earned his master's degree in public administration from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas-Austin. Sander's priority of working for the people in his community and his commitment to public service began at a young age before he ever made his way to Washington. He spent time  working for both the Wisconsin State Assembly and the Texas Employment Commission, making sure to give back to the States that he called home. This selflessness followed him to Washington as he spent the last 17 years of his life serving the citizens of Michigan and New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sander has now begun a new chapter in his life. And though everyone in my office and those that know him best were saddened to see him leave, we are all incredibly proud of the work he has done and are deeply grateful for the positive impact he has had on all of our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Sander resides in Washington, DC, with his wonderful wife Dorian Friedman, and their beautiful daughter Mara. As Sander continues on in what will certainly be an illustrious career, I wish him well. He is sorely missed, but I, and everyone around him, know that the same selflessness that brought him to public service will follow him to whatever path he chooses, and he will undoubtedly continue to improve the lives of those around him. I am honored to have had Sander serve as my chief of  staff, and I wish him only the best in the years ahead.</paragraph>
