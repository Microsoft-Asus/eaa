    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great honor that today I recognize the 60th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, for which the reunion is being held in Rapid City, SD. The Berlin Airlift Veterans Association will be holding the reunion September 29 through October 3, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first skirmishes of the Cold War began with the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948, which prevented residents of West Berlin from accessing food and fuel from outside the city indefinitely. Later deemed "the greatest humanitarian airlift in history," American, British, and French Allies supplied the 2 million residents of West Berlin with coal, food, medicine, and other supplies. Through nearly 300,000 flights, 2.5 million tons of supplies were delivered before the USSR lifted the blockade  in 1949.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have this opportunity to honor those involved in the Berlin Airlift, and their outstanding service to those in a most dire situation. The 50th anniversary reunion was held in Berlin in 1998, with President Clinton in attendance. Due to the deployment of B-29s from Ellsworth Air Force Base during the airlift, the 60th anniversary celebrations will be held in Rapid City, SD. Again, I commend the hard work and dedication of the American, British, and French pilots involved, and I am  very pleased that their substantial efforts are being publicly honored and celebrated.</paragraph>
