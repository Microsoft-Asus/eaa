  <narrative>OCCUPATION IN IRAQ SOAKING UP U.S. DOLLARS -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12136]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for the past 5 years, the administration has underfunded the No Child Left Behind Act to the tune of more than $50 billion. This has robbed millions of children of the education they will need to succeed in the 21st century, and it is robbing America of the brain power we need to stay competitive in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who believe it's a bad idea to shortchange our kids and our Nation begged the administration to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, but our pleas were ignored. That is one of the reasons I was so outraged last week when the White House requested $46 billion in supplemental funding for its occupation of Iraq. That $46 billion, Madam Speaker, is almost identical to the amount that the administration has underfunded No Child Left Behind. In fact, the administration announced its  request at a press conference. In that one short press conference, they asked for virtually the same amount for Iraq that it has been denying to our Nation's schools for nearly 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while the administration has demanded that every school in America show adequate yearly progress on its learning benchmarks or they will be punished, punished financially for the most part, it has allowed the Iraqi Government to show virtually no progress at all when it comes to meeting its benchmarks for peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And education is not the only crying need that is being ignored. The opportunity costs of the occupation are actually incalculable. The occupation is soaking up dollars we need to meet so many of our domestic challenges. If we really want America to be secure, we must invest in child care, we must invest in health care, sustainable energy, the environment, law enforcement, community and economic development, medical research, real homeland security, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the administration believes that policing a centuries-old civil war in  Iraq trumps all other needs. The American people do not agree with this administration's priorities. They want action, they want real solutions to our domestic problems, and they want to fight a real war on terrorism, not the phony war on terrorism the administration is fighting in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President signed the No Child Left Behind Act, Madam Speaker, he said it was the most important piece of legislation most of us will ever work on. The education of our children is far more important to the future of our country than an endless and counterproductive occupation of another country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Congress must finally stand up to the administration and say no, no to supplemental funding that would bring our total spending in Iraq this fiscal year alone to $160 billion. Madam Speaker, that's over $13 billion a month, or nearly $450 million per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost exactly a year ago, the American people sent us to Congress to end the occupation of Iraq. It's time that we do it. We must use our power of the purse to fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of all of our troops out of Iraq, and that includes the withdrawal of all of our military contractors as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As if one occupation army weren't enough, these independent contractors comprise a second occupation army that is angering the Iraqi people and actually making life much harder for our very own troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we can't afford to keep throwing money into the bottomless pit of Iraq. That appears to be what our leaders in the White House want us to do. But their policy is bankrupting all of us politically, economically, and morally. It is time that we come to our senses; it is time to end this madness.</paragraph>
