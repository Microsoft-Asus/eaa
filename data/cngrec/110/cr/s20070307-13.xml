    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to report the 2007 National Collegiate Men's and Women's Rifle Championships will be held in Fairbanks, AK on March 9 and 10. Forty-eight student-athletes will participate in this exciting competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although rifle is relatively new as an NCAA sport, 44 colleges and universities now sponsor rifle teams. Nationwide, hundreds of student-athletes compete in this sport. These young men and women are tremendously skilled--to score a bull's-eye in the smallbore competition, for instance, shooters must strike a target the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Remarkably, they are able to consistently hit this mark from a distance of 50 feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like more traditional sports, rifle has a positive impact on its participants. Marsha Beasley, the former head coach of West Virginia University's team, once observed: "Rifle provides a wonderful opportunity to learn many life skills such as self-discipline, concentration, the ability to relax under pressure, goal-setting, sportsmanship and teamwork." Just as important, rifle teaches participants how to handle guns in a safe, responsible manner. It is also one of the few sports where men and  women compete against each other as equals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rifle competition has a great history in our State, and Alaskans are honored the NCAA has chosen Fairbanks as this year's host. The timing of this event is particularly fitting--2007 marks the 70th anniversary of the University of Alaska Fairbanks' first rifle team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, UAF has found great success in this sport. The university is the NCAA's reigning rifle champion and has claimed the national title in 7 of the past 8 years. Since 1988, 39 Nanooks have been selected as All-Americans in rifle. Seven of these competitors have won individual rifle championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rifle's popularity is also apparent throughout our state. Today, Fairbanks is one of several Alaska cities with a robust rifle community, and many high schools in our state now sponsor rifle teams as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while I will be rooting for the home team, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I wish each participant the best in this competition. The names of each team and individual selected for the 2007 National Collegiate Men's and Women's Rifle Championships are as follows:</paragraph>
