    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Iraqis to stand up and defend themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have freed them from a ruthless dictator. We have lost more than 3,000 lives. We have more than 20,000 wounded. We have helped them to construct a constitution, to reestablish their constabulary. We have helped them hold an election, and we are spending more than $177 million, not per year, not per month, not per week, but per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for them to stand up and defend themselves. Do not send 20,000 in; bring 20,000 troops home. It is time for them to stand up and defend themselves.</paragraph>
