  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague and my friend, Mr. Wilson of South Carolina, introduced this resolution that seeks to recognize the significance of the festival of Diwali. Diwali is celebrated as victory of good over evil for some, and as a remembrance of liberation for others. Ultimately, it is a day of joy celebrated annually by Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains throughout the world, particularly by Indians and Indian Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With more than 2 million devotees of these faiths in our country, this resolution honors this holiday and those who cherish its message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few religious holidays that are celebrated by a multitude of faiths, and it is a tribute to the diversity of India and to our country that we have such a rich religious heritage in our societies. By celebrating Diwali, we also are celebrating this diversity, a shared value that has brought the United States and India closer together through the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been said about our two countries being natural partners in this world; and the importance of having multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and, indeed, multi-religious societies cannot be overemphasized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I look forward to celebrating this festival and strongly support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 747, which recognizes the significance of the festival of Diwali.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my appreciation to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for his leadership on this issue and so many issues that are affecting U.S. relations with India and Indian Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know because of our previous speaker, Diwali is a major, multi-cultural festival celebrated in India and everywhere around the world. Although often referred to as a Hindu festival, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists also observe it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known as the Festival of Lights, it symbolizes the victory of good over evil, and lamps are lit as a sign of celebration and hope for mankind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diwali is celebrated for 5 consecutive days in October or November, and it is one of the most popular and eagerly awaited festivals in India. This celebration presents all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the many ways in which people, history and traditions of India, and elsewhere in South Asia, have contributed to the rich cultural mosaic that is the United States of America. It also reminds us again that America's extraordinary diversity is one of our Nation's most enduring strengths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to sponsor a similar resolution in the 109th Congress, House Resolution 584, which also recognizes the significance of this important festival of Diwali.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the proud sponsor of House Resolution 747, I am pleased that this legislation recognizing the religious and historical significance of the festival of Diwali has been brought to the floor today for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Celebrated by the people of India, the Indian Diaspora and the nearly two million Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains who call America their home, the Diwali festival is a five day event held in the fall that celebrates the values of kinship, knowledge, and goodness. It signifies the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. This is commonly represented by individuals lighting oil lamps and placing them outside their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My resolution acknowledges the international, religious, and historical importance of the festival of Diwali as well as the religious diversity in India, the United States, and throughout the world. It shows our support for the strong and growing partnership and dialogue in international efforts between the United States and India. Lastly, it recognizes the importance of Indian Americans--a strong and vibrant immigrant community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, as well as a lifelong supporter and admirer of the Indian American community, I am grateful for the opportunity to show my appreciation. My father served in India during WorId War II, and he told me how entrepreneurial and competent the people of India are. I call on my colleagues here in the House of Representatives to do the same for the citizens of India, a strategic and economic ally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Ishani Chowdhury with the Hindu American Foundation, my Chief of Staff Dino Teppara, my Legislative Assistant Paul Callahan, and Arshi Siddiqui with Speaker NANCY PELOSI's office for their cooperation and dedication in bringing this important resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
