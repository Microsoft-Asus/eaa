  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this House will begin a debate on Iraq. This is the first of a series of debates that we must have on the House floor. It is a resolution. It reflects President Bush's plan to escalate the occupation of Iraq, and it will be a clean up or down vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Democratic leadership for providing a time for every single Member of this body to come to the floor and have their say. If you support escalation, you vote "yes." If not, you vote "no." I will support the legislation as a very important first step in this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But after that, Congress must go on record in opposition of the war in general. First we have to go on record in opposition of escalation, and then we must change our course and lay out a plan to bring our troops home. There have been many, many ideas, both inside and outside of Congress, to plan for an end to this occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few are as comprehensive as <bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill>, the Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Act. I introduced this bill last month and have 34, 35 cosponsors today, with more interest expressed every single day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill> will end the occupation of Iraq within 6 months of passage. It will accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi military and security forces while preparing to bring our troops and contractors out of Iraq safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will commit to working with the international community to assist the Iraqis in rebuilding and in reconciliation if they agree and want us to be there. <bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill> will fully fund the health care commitment to our returning veterans. Additionally, the bill revokes the President's Iraq war powers, prevents the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, and returns the oil rights to the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to our brave men and brave women in uniform and to the Iraqi people to bring our troops home now. Let us be honest, the Iraqis don't want us there. They view us as an occupying force. They want to be strengthening their security forces, and they want to establish a reliable and dependable infrastructure and provide for their most basic needs like sanitation, health care, and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can assist them; but in the end, Iraq must belong to the Iraqi people. Having learned from our past, we will never turn our backs on the returning troops, those who have been put in an unimaginable position. They have seen death; they have seen destruction up close, in a way many of us will never understand. They are returning with scars, both visible and invisible. The least we can do is fulfill our commitment to them by fully funding the medical services they have been promised. This is  not a gift we are giving them. This is a right, this is an entitlement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise tonight, and I will rise again during the three days of debate to signal my support for the upcoming resolution as a very important first step: my support for the troops and their promised benefits, my support for the American people, who want our troops home.</paragraph>
