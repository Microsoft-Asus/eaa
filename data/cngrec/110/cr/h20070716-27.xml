  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="487">H. Res. 487</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the United States of America is a great and prosperous Nation, and modeling and simulation contribute significantly to that greatness and prosperity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas modeling and simulation in the United States is a unique application of computer science and mathematics that depends on the validity, verification, and reproducibility of the model or simulation, and depends also on the capability of the thousands of Americans in modeling and simulation careers to develop these models;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas members of the modeling and simulation community in government, industry, and academia have made significant contributions to the general welfare of the United States, and while these contributions are too numerous to enumerate, modeling and simulation efforts have contributed to the United States by--</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) expanding the understanding of nuclear chain reactions during the Manhattan Project through some of the earliest simulations replicating the reaction process, which ultimately contributed to the end of World War II;</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) serving as a foundational element of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which enabled the President of the United States to certify the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear stockpile for more than ten years without the use of live nuclear testing, which demonstrates the Nation's commitment to nuclear nonproliferation;</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) accelerating the effectiveness of joint, coalition, and interagency training exercises, while dramatically reducing the costs of such exercises, as demonstrated by United States Joint Forces Command's 2007 homeland security exercise, Noble Resolve, which was conducted virtually and required 5  months, 140 personnel, and $2,000,000 for development, compared to a 2002 Millennium Challenge exercise that was conducted live and required 5 years, 14,000  personnel, and $250,000,000 for development;</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) preserving countless human lives, as well as military and civilian aircraft, ships, and other vehicles through the rehearsal of repeatable, simulated emergencies that otherwise could not have been practiced;</narrative>
  <narrative>(5) increasing the quality of health care through the development of medical simulation training, which led the Food and Drug Administration to require such training for physicians before certain high-risk procedures to treat heart disease and strokes;</narrative>
  <narrative>(6) reducing the cost of health care, as demonstrated by medical malpractice insurance rate discounts being provided to anesthesiologists and obstetricians who include simulated procedures in their biennial training requirements;</narrative>
  <narrative>(7) simulating large scale natural or man-made disasters to improve the effectiveness of local, State, and Federal first responders, law enforcement, and other agencies involved in a coordinated emergency response;</narrative>
  <narrative>(8) forecasting weather and predicting climate change to enable scientists, industry, and policymakers to study the effects of climate change and also to prepare for extreme weather, such as hurricanes;</narrative>
  <narrative>(9) protecting rivers, waterways, and endangered species reliant on these waters through the Environmental Protection Agency's hydrology Dynamic Stream Simulation and Assessment Model, which predicts impacts on water quality for the Truckee River, including its effect on Lake Tahoe and other portions of its basin;</narrative>
  <narrative>(10) producing analysis that resulted in enhanced designs and construction of critical infrastructure, such as roads, interchanges, airports, harbors, railways, and bridges that increases transportation capacity and safety, and reduces travel time and environmental impact; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(11) providing National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts training to ensure a safe and productive mission in space, including the utilization of the Shuttle Training Aircraft, which simulates real aircraft shuttle characteristics and enables NASA pilots to have 1,000 simulated shuttle landings before they land the Space Shuttle for the first time as a glider;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas these contributions, in addition to numerous contributions that are not listed but that equally have brought prosperity to our Nation, demonstrate that modeling and simulation efforts have, and will continue to--</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) provide vital strategic support functions to our Military;</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) defend our freedom and advance United States interests around the world;</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) promote better health care through improved medical training, improved quality of care, reduced medical errors, and reduced cost;</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) encourage comprehensive planning for national disaster and emergency preparedness response;</narrative>
  <narrative>(5) improve and secure our critical infrastructure and transportation systems;</narrative>
  <narrative>(6) protect the environment; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(7) allow the Nation to explore the Earth and space to further our understanding of our world and universe;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas modeling and simulation frequently complements or replaces experimentation where experimentation is hazardous, expensive, or impossible, thus providing far greater capability than experimentation alone;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the modeling and simulation industry provides well-paying jobs to many Americans and represents an opportunity for Americans with strong foundations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to contribute to the prosperity and security of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas other countries have recognized the value of modeling and simulation as an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage over the United States economically and militarily, and some of these same countries produce more engineers each year than the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas modeling and simulation efforts are critically dependent on a fundamental education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas modeling and simulation require unique knowledge, skills, and abilities that are not adequately incorporated into governmental occupational classification codes; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas advances in modeling and simulation can be achieved through innovation in the private sector, and proper export controls and intellectual property rights are critical to the continued growth and innovation in this sector: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) commends those who have contributed to the modeling and simulation efforts which have developed essential characteristics of our Nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) urges that, consistent with previous legislation passed by this and previous Congresses, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics remain key disciplines for primary and secondary education;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) encourages the expansion of modeling and simulation as a tool and subject within higher education;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) recognizes modeling and simulation as a National Critical Technology;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) affirms the need to study the national economic impact of modeling and simulation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) supports the development and implementation of governmental classification codes that include separate classification for modeling and simulation occupations; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (7) encourages the development and implementation of ways to protect intellectual property of modeling and simulation enterprises.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="487">H. Res. 487</bill>, which recognizes the contribution of modeling and simulation technology to the security and prosperity of the United States, and recognizing modeling and simulation as a national critical technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeling and simulation is an important technology. It allows scientists to understand the functioning of complex systems that would otherwise be impossible to comprehend. It allows developers to understand their products better. It allows industry to save money that would otherwise be spent on experimentation and to allocate those funds to other activities, and allows our military to understand the impacts of their weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, modeling and simulation is a very powerful tool that has improved our lives in many ways. Americans lead the world in this technology, and we should acknowledge that. It's important that we nurture this industry and stimulate its further growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400131" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Gordon for bringing this resolution successfully through his committee, and I rise in support of House Resolution 487, and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Resolution 487 recognizes that modeling and simulation technology is a national critical technology essential for America's long-term national security and her economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Modeling and Simulation Caucus, and representing one of the largest modeling and simulation clusters in the United States, I urge that the House pass this resolution to help retain America's lead in this high-technology field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your child's or your grandchild's video game represents one product of the modeling and simulation industry. Aircraft training simulators provide another well-known example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simulation uses combinations of sound, sight and motion to make you feel that you are experiencing an actual event. Modeling involves the complex computer models used to create these artificial environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For training purposes, modeling and simulation places people in an artificial, but seemingly real, environment and puts them through their paces. Unlike live training, if you make a mistake, you get to live another day and learn valuable lessons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the latter part of the 20th century, the U.S. military revolutionized warfighting by emphasizing this high-fidelity training that simulates the stress and decision-making of actual combat. Servicemen and -women gain experience and judgment previously only earned on the actual battlefield, often through serious injury and death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Substantial amounts of that simulation and training come from my congressional district where representatives of all service branches collaborate with the University of Central Florida and private contractors of all sizes to produce these training systems. As other speakers will note, other clusters of modeling and simulation excellence exist throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But such training expands beyond military uses. Commercial aviation's  enviable safety record is due in part to aircraft simulator training that prepares cockpit crews to handle complex and fast-paced emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that vein, medical simulation is an especially promising and emerging field. By creating artificial, but seemingly real, environments, doctors and nurses can hone their skills in using sophisticated and invasive medical technology or in treating severely injured patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond training, modeling and simulation replicates complex environments, allowing planners and designers to ask various "what if" questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transportation planners simulate highway networks to determine how best to alleviate congestion. Emergency management experts simulate large-scale natural or manmade disasters to better improve coordinated emergency responses. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the need to better use modeling and simulation in order to protect life and property during such disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of these growing numbers of uses, the modeling and simulation industry is rapidly growing and demands the best students with extensive math and science backgrounds including psychology, medicine, computer science, mathematics, engineering and physics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the cluster in Central Florida, there's a great cluster of modeling and simulation in the Fourth Congressional District represented by Congressman RANDY FORBES, and I'd like to indulge my colleagues to paraphrase some important comments by Congressman Forbes and then would like to insert his comments, the original text, in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Forbes points out that we can test a new airplane in a wind tunnel without risking human life and without building full scale airplanes. The benefits and applications of this technology are immediately obvious. We can learn a system in a more cost-effective, timely and safer manner. And, furthermore, we can simulate thousands of scenarios over and over again on a computer when it is too hazardous, expensive, or impossible to perform real world tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in short, modeling simulation tools allow us to understand complex interactions that would otherwise be impossible to comprehend using other means. If modeling and simulation sounds like it has the promise to dramatically change the way we apply science in our world, the fact is that it has already done so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution seeks to recognize the countless efforts of professionals who have taken this technology and applied it to make the United States a safer and more prosperous Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of modeling and simulation technology is felt in the private sector, academia, government, and across disciplines. Modeling and simulation tools have streamlined the design and manufacture of cars, homes, boats and airplanes, to name a few devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeling and simulation software designed in Illinois, for example, assists automotive engineers in designing engines that are more efficient, while reducing emissions that impact adversely our environment. Modeling and simulation analysis is also used in the engineering of major roads, bridges, harbors, railways and airports, all of which lead to increased transportation capacity and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the United States Joint Forces Command in the Fourth District of Virginia, represented by Congressman Forbes, modeling and simulation tools have accelerated the effectiveness of joint interagency exercises run by the command. One of their experimentation projects is to enhance our national security by running scenarios in an urban combat environment. The goal is to provide lessons learned for our troops in theater before they encounter the same situation on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of these kinds of valuable contributions, this resolution honors modeling and simulation by recognizing it as a national critical technology. National critical technology refers to those technologies essential to develop long-term national security and economic prosperity for our country. One example of the success historically of modeling and simulation is the famous Manhattan Project. It was early models and simulators that allowed scientists to develop an understanding of nuclear chain  reactions that ultimately led to the end of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's military have used simulators to train personnel for flying aircraft, ships, and we now use simulators to train soldiers and marines to detect roadside IEDs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, in the past, medical malpractice insurance rates have included artificially high premiums because it was difficult to reduce the number of medical errors for certain medical procedures that were not routinely performed. Today, insurance discounts are being provided to anesthesiologists and obstetricians who include simulated procedures in their biennial training requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the advantages that we have reaped from modeling and simulation go across all congressional districts and benefit all Americans in ways that are often unseen. I am thrilled to be a cosponsor of this resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman. The future is very bright and modeling, simulation and training will lead the way to make it a safer, brighter future for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Central Florida represents one of the larger if not the largest Modeling and Simulation clusters in the United States. The Navy's NAVAIR Orlando and the Army's PEO-STRI are based in my District. Over 100 Modeling and Simulation companies directly employ over 6,000 people. Having reached a critical mass in Central Florida, the Modeling and Simulation industry continues to expand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Central Florida achieved critical mass by leveraging relationships among military, academic, industry, and government entities. Locally, we refer to this rich and complex web of cooperation, collaboration, and partnerships as Team Orlando.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 50 years before "jointness" and "transformation" became favored concepts in the Department of Defense, the Navy and Army demonstrated these traits in Orlando by starting a partnership for the development of training systems. The Air Force and Marines joined as full partners during the 1990s. All military services use a common infrastructure of facilities, contracting, administration, and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collaboration with academia is demonstrated by the University of Central Florida and its Institute for Simulation and Training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The private sector is represented by a portfolio of Modeling and Simulation companies. Recognized and established entities are present such as Lockheed Martin and SAIC. But Central Florida is also home to scores of innovative, entrepreneurial start-ups such as IDEAL Technologies and Vcom3D.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lessons learned from Central Florida's experience can be applied nationally. Modeling and Simulation isn't a zero-sum game where success in one geographic area comes at the expense of another. This technology holds so much promise that everyone benefits from national cooperation and collaboration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's resolution will help create a unified national identity for this technology. And it will raise this technology's profile within the Department of Defense, other government agencies, and the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeling and simulation allows us to better understand and control complex systems ranging from highway systems, manufacturing and processing facilities, and emergency management systems. Modeling and simulation also trains people to handle complex and fast-paced situations ranging from warfighting to emergency medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge support of this resolution recognizing modeling and simulation as a National Critical Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me just conclude by saying I think this is our 30th bill with Mr. Feeney's help out of the Science Committee. All have been bipartisan. All but two have been unanimous. This is another good piece of legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while nearly all Members of this body have benefited from the application of modeling and simulation, or M-and-S, technology in one way or another, I want to briefly describe what we are talking about when we discuss Modeling and Simulation technology. "Modeling and Simulation" simply refers to replicating a system on a smaller scale or on a computer for extensive analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, we can test a new airplane in a wind tunnel without risking human life and without building full-scale airplanes. The benefits and applications of this technology are immediately obvious: we can learn about a system in a more cost-effective, timely, and safer manner than analyzing the real thing. And furthermore, we can simulate thousands of scenarios over and over again on a computer when it is too hazardous, expensive, or impossible to perform a real-world experiment.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H7810]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in short, M-and-S tools allow us to understand complex interactions that would otherwise be impossible to comprehend using other means. If modeling and simulation technology sounds like it has the promise to dramatically change the way we apply science in the world, the fact is, that is has already done so--and this resolution seeks to recognize the countless efforts of the professionals who have taken this technology and applied it to make the United States a safer and more prosperous Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of Modeling and Simulation technology is felt in the private sector, academia, government, and across all disciplines. M-and-S tools have streamlined the design and manufacturing of cars, homes, boats, and airplanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>M-and-S software designed in Illinois is assisting automotive engineers to design engines that are more efficient while reducing emissions. M-and-S analysis is also used in the engineering of major roads, bridges, harbors, railways, and airports--all of which lead to increased transportation capacity and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the United States Joint Forces Command in the Fourth Congressional District in Virginia, M-and-S tools have accelerated the effectiveness of joint and interagency exercises run by the Command. One of their experimentation projects is to enhance our national security by running scenarios in an urban combat environment. Their goal is to provide "lessons learned" for our troops in theater before they encounter the same situation on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of these kinds of valuable contributions, this resolution honors modeling and simulation by recognizing it as a National Critical Technology. A National Critical Technology refers to those technologies that are essential to develop in order to ensure the long-term national security and economic prosperity of the United States. I have already mentioned how modeling and simulation has broadly contributed to our national security and the economic prosperity, but let me name a few specific  examples:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Manhattan Project, it was early models and simulations that allowed scientists to a developed understanding of nuclear chain reactions that ultimately led to the end of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's military have used simulators to train personnel for flying aircraft and ships, and now they use simulators to train soldiers and marines to detect roadside IEDs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, in the past, medical malpractice insurance rates have included artificially high premiums because it was difficult to reduce the number of medical errors for certain medical procedures that were not routinely performed. Today, however, insurance discounts are being provided to anesthesiologists and obstetricians who include simulated procedures in their biennial training requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend those that have used M-and-S tools to make great contributions to this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 487, which recognizes modeling and simulation as a national critical technology. I would like to thank my friend from Virginia's Fourth Congressional District and the chair of the Congressional Modeling and Simulation Caucus, Congressman Randy Forbes, for introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeling and simulation has become an essential component in ensuring that we meet both the defense and domestic challenges of the 21st century. Modeling and simulation allows us to easily and effectively sharpen the tools, procedures, and decisions needed to address difficult and complex problems. This critical technology allows us to build and develop models of complex systems--whether a car, an airplane, an entire battlefield, or even a major city's evacuation plan--to see how certain actions  will affect the end result. These simulations help us develop better and practical analogies of real world situations. With the growing international challenges of the 21st century, this technology is vital to the defense of our great Nation. Simulating battlefield conditions will sharpen the skills of the brave men and women serving in our armed forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the practical uses of modeling, analysis and simulation technology as a training tool are boundless. Military and airline pilots have been using this technology for decades. Congress should be interested in using this technology for homeland security, disaster preparedness, and other ways to benefit the public; the resolution before the House today ensures that this body is aware of how critical this technology is for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent the people and businesses of the Third Congressional District of Virginia who are a part of this important and growing sector of Virginia's economy. In addition to our local military bases supporting the Joint Forces Center in Suffolk, our local colleges and universities and NASA Langley Research Center on the Virginia peninsula are engaged in applying people, tools and facilities to modeling, analysis and simulation technology. Hampton Roads is leading  the way in modeling and simulation technology. The Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center in Suffolk, Virginia, is a premier facility that is second to none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The modeling and simulation industry is vital to the growing economy of Hampton Roads and the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Hampton Roads Congressional Delegation has a history of working together and we will continue to do so in promoting this important industry in this Congress. Using modeling and simulation technology in the fields of science, national defense, homeland security and disaster planning will better the lives of all Americans and make our great Nation safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am glad that the House is considering this resolution today and I encourage all my colleagues to support this resolution and to learn more about this critical technology.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in addition to formally recognizing modeling and simulation contributions, H. Res 487 urges Congress to continue to invest in critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM education--disciplines that are essential to the expansion of modeling and simulation technology. Previous Congresses, as well as this Congress, have demonstrated a deep commitment to furthering STEM education. Because the skills required for modeling and simulation develop over  a long period of time--it is essential that we begin to develop these critical skills in our children now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already, academic programs for modeling and simulation have sprung up across the country, at places such as Texas A&amp;M and at the Virginia Modeling and Simulation Center based out of Old Dominion University. There, nearly 100 modeling and simulation professionals seek new ways to apply this technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must invest now rather than later, and I applaud the efforts of the Administration and this House towards that end. This investment is particularly valuable as other countries continue to produce more engineers than we graduate each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is also meant to bring to the attention of this body, that policy decisions made in Congress and in the Administration can either accelerate the implementation of this technology, or unnecessarily slow its growth. That's why for the past 2 years, leaders in modeling and simulation from government, academia, and the private sector from around the country have come together in Virginia to identify the key policy challenges that are affecting the modeling and simulation industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, since last year, there has been a prohibition in place that prevents the Department of Defense from purchasing any flight simulator using a services contract. Now, if that prohibition had been in place just one year earlier, the Army's Flight School Twenty One at Fort Rucker, Alabama, would not have had the chance to revolutionize the way the Army's future aviators train. Because the prohibition came into affect after the service contract was signed, the Army was able to incorporate  modern simulations into the heart of the training curriculum. As lawmakers, we ought to be aware of these policies, how they came about, and whether they are still valid or have outlived their usefulness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we recognize a technology that has been instrumental to our Nation, it follows that we should also understand the workforce that is producing these accomplishments. The professionals who make up the modeling and simulation community are scientists, mathematicians, programmers, and analysts. And unfortunately, we do not know much about them in part because they do not fit neatly into any current category as defined by the Department of Labor. There is also no nationwide estimate of how large  the modeling and simulation community is; or whether our education system is producing an adequately technical workforce. So the government's classification of occupational codes is another area where Federal policy impacts modeling and simulation technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues know, the Department of Labor uses classification codes to identify and describe many occupations. The codes identify the projected job market, and the typical skills, education, and experience requirements. Particularly for occupations related to critical technologies such as modeling and simulation, it is important that we identify these details. With this information, we can learn if the number of technical graduates each year can match expected modeling and simulation  job growth, and we can identify the economic impact this industry has had across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as Members consider their vote on this measure today, I would encourage my colleagues to keep in mind how this technology can break some of the logjams that seem to know no solution. For instance,  medical errors persist even in the best hospitals. But, these errors could likely be reduced if we can train our medical professionals in situations that replicate the most common errors or scenarios without ever seeing a patient. Simulation  can also extend the value of each defense dollar, which will only become more important as rising entitlement spending squeezes overall discretionary spending, which includes defense spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can increase the opportunity for interagency cooperation by decreasing the financial and time costs associated with exposing department-long bureaucrats to other agencies. One way to do this is through simulated exercises and interagency education and training. Just five years ago, a large scale defense exercise was run with many personnel in real-time. It required 5 years, 14,000 personnel, and 250 million dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, a recent interagency exercise at U.S. Joint Forces Command was conducted to practice responding to a natural and a man-made disaster. It required only 5 months, 140 personnel and 2 million dollars to develop. Madam Speaker, the price of many things that the government buys only goes up with time. But, with modeling and simulation, we can improve the value of each taxpayer's dollar by saving money on personnel costs, equipment, and time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeling and Simulation also contributed to finding a solution to the concerns of nuclear testing. For a long time, there was a tension between wanting to have certainty in the reliability of our nuclear stockpile that at the time, was believed to only be achieved by live testing. But there were also concerns that more testing by the United States would negatively impact our nuclear nonproliferation efforts. Fortunately, an acceptable solution came in the form of modeling and simulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Government's Department of Energy national laboratories in California and New Mexico, modeling and simulation tools serve as a foundational element of the National Nuclear Security Administration's Stockpile Stewardship Program, which enables the President of the United States to certify the safety security and reliability of nuclear stockpile for more than 10 years without the use of live nuclear testing. So, we are able to have full certainty as to the readiness of our primary deterrent,  while also demonstrating the Nation's commitment to nuclear nonproliferation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are at the tip of the iceberg as to what other issues modeling and simulation can address. I urge passage of this resolution that commends past modeling and simulation successes, and which presents a glimpse of the kinds of issues this House must address in the future to advance the benefits of this technology for the security and economy of this country.</paragraph>
