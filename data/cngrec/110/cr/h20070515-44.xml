    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="296">H. Res. 296</bill>) supporting the goals and ideals of National Eosinophil Awareness Week, and for other purposes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="296">H. Res. 296</bill>, recognizing National Eosinophil Awareness Week, and I commend my colleague Congressman John Larson for bringing attention to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eosinophilic disorders are devastating as patients literally suffer from an attack on their bodies by their own immune systems. They are chronic disorders that have no cure and can even be fatal. Because they are rare, patients often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as a nurse, I have seen intimately how heartbreaking it is for a patient and his or her family to go through test after test while suffering all the while from an unidentifiable condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I support this resolution, calling for greater awareness of eosinophilic disorders and encouraging health care providers to increase education about these diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400288" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to speak on behalf of this bill which does promote awareness about eosinophil disorders. These are little known disorders that are thought  to be both allergic and autoimmune in nature. The body produces white blood cells in higher than normal amounts, and it attacks food proteins and tissues as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The patients who have this chronic disease suffer a variety of symptoms, and of course it is sometimes life-threatening. As of now, there's no known cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Mr. Larson is going to be speaking on this because he personally has firsthand knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400233" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding but also for her continued outstanding service in the United States Congress and bringing the knowledge of her profession and her expertise to this body on a regular basis and especially the compassion that's needed for so many of those who suffer from eosinophilic disorder, more than 50,000 in this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to applaud my colleague from North Carolina, also, Representative Myrick, for her cosponsoring this legislation and understanding as well the importance that this has for so many families who oftentimes are the ones who suffer along with the patient because of lack of diagnosis, and then also because of the way Representative Capps has described the nature of this disease, what it does to the patient that it attacks when the white blood cells in your own system begin  to attack itself and creates the disorders that it does, often resulting in people having to be fed by tubes. You can imagine the tremendous stress that this causes on the parts of parents and of course family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill comes before us not because of me, but because of a courageous woman like Lois Capps and like Sue Myrick who understand what families go through when they face issues like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was fortunate to have Dr. Wendy Book from my district in Connecticut, who resides in Gastonbury, a doctor herself, as well as her husband, come before me to talk about this disorder because of their desire to make sure that the Nation be made aware of what so many children are suffering from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was joined by Beth Mays, who together are the co-founders of the American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders. When Dr. Book's son Ryan was sick before his first birthday, doctors sent him home with a feeding tube and no explanation for his mysterious illness. This illness went undiagnosed for 2 more years. Now, this Ryan, his parents are doctors. They are in the field, and so for doctors to be as confounded by a lack of understanding or a diagnosis, imagine the consternation that they  feel, and then exemplify that by how other parents must feel who do not come from similar professions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so they felt in founding this organization, this partnership, that what was needed across the country was awareness and understanding. Quite frankly, what's also needed is funding, but it has to start in a place of education, awareness and understanding, and as most pieces of critical legislation do, it comes not from a Member of Congress, but it comes from a constituent, a citizen, who has the temerity to stand up and speak out for suffering that a neighbor or one of their own children is  going through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mrs. Capps pointed out, sometimes there is no cure or the diagnosis eludes all the best efforts of professions, but it is getting better, and with awareness, they know they can deal with this going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hospitals in Cincinnati, and most notably, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where I visited personally, are working hard at identifying this disorder and helping parents and working with them. I want to commend the work of Dr. Chris Lancouris and Dr. Jonathan Spergel and especially Michelle Shuker who spent so much time dealing with the parents and helping them through this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who has a son who has an illness that has gone undiagnosed, I empathize deeply with parents who go through this experience and understand deeply the need for education, the need for better understanding, and the responsibility that we share as Members of Congress to do our part, to first educate the public with respect to this disorder, but then secondly and more hopefully, to make sure that we follow through by funding and assisting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what you have to step back and admire, however, is the courage of these parents who, without their love and devotion and care for their children, without their consistent nurturing and support, you wonder what would happen to these children. But because of their courage and because of their ability to come forth and speak out about this, hopefully through resolutions like this and greater understanding we will be able to assist them and help them and assist families, and their not-for-profit  organization will get the support that it needs, will create the understanding that it needs and provide the much needed relief for the children who are afflicted and the families that deal with this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank Representative Capps and I thank Representative Myrick and a number of cosponsors on this legislation for having come forward and assisted in bringing this to the forefront.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be members from this association on the Hill tomorrow going to various House Members and to their offices and talking with them and their staff about this disorder. Please listen to them. Take them into your heart. It is an important issue and vital not only for their children, their families, but I dare say for all of us in the country. It speaks volumes to the better angels that we have here in the United States Congress and our willingness to reach out and assist the constituents  we are sworn to serve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I would like to inquire of the gentlewoman if she has any more speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no more speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400288" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>As I indicated, I have no more speakers, either, but I do want to say a word of thanks to my colleague from North Carolina. We serve on the same committee. This is an issue that we both care about, but particular thanks to my colleague from Connecticut for reaffirming in me one of the major reasons that I am pleased to be part of this body, which was illustrated by his comments regarding his constituent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he observed their personal experience and was able to relate some of his own is when we do the work of the people, to carry the pain and suffering, if you will, the unanswered questions and the concerns, and to do the people's work by first creating an awareness of a situation. We have many issues before us, but for a family with a person diagnosed with an eosinophilic condition, it is a major, major part of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we owe a responsibility and it is a privilege and a honor to carry their concerns to this body, to take this first step of recognition and to be welcoming to those who come with personal experiences to our office doors tomorrow and then to learn what the next step after this one might be and to stand ready as elected officials to work on behalf of those who simply desire to relieve the pain and suffering of dear and loved members of their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank both of my colleagues for bringing this to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="296">H. Res. 296</bill>.</chair>
