  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in consideration of <bill type="h" number="5135">H.R. 5135</bill>, which seeks to designate a postal facility in Derby, Kansas, in honor of Sergeant Jamie O. Maugans, the first soldier from Kansas to lose his life in Operation Enduring Freedom. That's the war in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5135">H.R. 5135</bill> enjoys the support of the entire congressional delegation from the State of Kansas and was introduced by my colleague, Representative TODD TIAHRT, on January 23, 2008. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, and was passed by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5135">H.R. 5135</bill> calls for honoring Sergeant Maugans' service to our country by designating the post office in his home town of Derby, Kansas, as the Sergeant Maugans Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A graduate of Derby High School and a former student of the University of Kansas and Cowley County Community College, Sergeant Maugans served diligently as a member of the armed services since 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Maugans was an ordnance disposal specialist and stationed in San Diego, California, before being deployed to Afghanistan in the fall of 2001. On April 15, 2002, while deposing of ordnances near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Sergeant Maugans was killed along with three other soldiers in his unit when rockets which he was attempting to dismantle exploded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of <bill type="h" number="5135">H.R. 5135</bill>. And I apologize for not pronouncing the sponsor of the legislation's name correctly. I suspect I did not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in deference to the gentleman who introduced this bill, TODD TIAHRT, who is a member of the Appropriations Committee and is also on its Defense subcommittee and also a member of the Intelligence Committee, I'm going to insert my statement into the Record and then yield him as much time as he might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 201 West Germany Street in Derby, Kansas, as the "Sergeant Jamie O. Maugans Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Derby, SGT Jamie Maugans was the first casualty of the global war on terror from the 4th Congressional District in Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A graduate of Derby High School, Sergeant Maugans attended the University of Kansas and Cowley Community College before joining the Army. Stationed in San Diego serving as an ordnance disposal specialist, he deployed to Afghanistan shortly after the attacks of 9/11 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 15, 2002, while disposing of ordnance near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Sergeant Maugans, along with three others, lost his life in an accidental ordnance explosion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Described by his friends as one of the "kindest, most gentle-hearted people on the planet," Jamie Maugans died preserving the lives of his fellow soldiers and the freedom of this Nation. I urge that we accept this bill to honor that spirit of sacrifice embodied by Sergeant Maugans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina for carrying this bill and also the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding to me and for the great job he's doing here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am also honored to have to carry this bill. And, today, Congress has the honor to approve the bill, naming the post office in Derby, Kansas, after a true American hero, SGT Jamie O'Dell Maugans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Maugans was the first casualty of the global war on terror from the 4th District of Kansas, a district that has experienced 12 casualties in this war. A Derby native, Sergeant Maugans graduated from Derby High School and attended Cowley County Community College and the University of Kansas before joining the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the terrorists attacked our Nation on September 11, 2001, Jamie was serving as an ordnance disposal specialist stationed in San Diego, California. Shortly after those attacks, he was deployed in Afghanistan in connection with Operation Enduring Freedom. On April 15, 2002, while disposing of ordnance near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Sergeant Maugans was killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The explosion also took the lives of three other soldiers, including fellow Kansan, SSG Justin Galewski from Olathe. Jamie was only 27 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Maugans left behind a loving family and friends in Kansas. I know his mother, Kathy Wurdeman, and his father, Bryce Maugans, his step-mother, Mary Maugans, and his brother and four sisters are very proud of Jamie and his service to this country. I am honored to have worked with the Maugans family and the Derby community on this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this bill names the Derby Post Office building after Sergeant Maugans, this endeavor is not only a way to honor Jamie, but a way to honor all those from Kansas who have died in defense of this Nation from radical Muslims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the first casualty from my district, Jamie's life and memory are a representation of all those who have lost their lives in the global war on terror. I hope this effort will be a reminder to everyone in south central Kansas of the sacrifice that so many veterans have made for our country and our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take just a few moments to read the names of all those from the 4th District of Kansas who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan so that their sacrifice is honored:</paragraph>
