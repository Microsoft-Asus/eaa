    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is Halloween. The Democrats are doing a good job celebrating it. They are handing out entitlements like Halloween candy. The question is how are we going to pay for it. Well, they have approved $431 billion in new taxes this year, but for Halloween they have got something that is really scary: the mother of all tax increases, the biggest tax increase in the history of our country, $3.5 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question becomes on Halloween, with fuel prices going up, with the cost of health care going up, with the cost of housing going up, how can we face something as scary as the mother of all tax increases.</paragraph>
