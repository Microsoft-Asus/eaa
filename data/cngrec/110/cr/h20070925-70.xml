    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 75th birthday of my friend and family's former priest, Father Robert Bond. Father Bob, as his parishioners call him, is a retired priest of the Glenmary Home Missioners with a legacy of loving compassion not only for his church but for the unchurched and the less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Bond currently lives in Micaville, North Carolina, but he previously served in many places including Boone, North Carolina, where he served the flock at St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church for 4 years. During his time at St. Elizabeth's, Father Bond typified the church's call to reach out to those in need and share the love of Christ. He was truly ahead of his time in his faithful efforts to bring the power of God's love to those who might never darken the door of a church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most significant contribution he made to the community of Boone was his vision for Camp Dogwood in Valle Crucis, North Carolina. Camp Dogwood was a ministry that Father Bond ran for disadvantaged youth. On the power of his vision and the work of many volunteers, Camp Dogwood brightened the days and brought hope to the lives of many underprivileged children in North Carolina. He practiced the "No Child Left Behind" concept long before it was a national slogan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Bond's 75th birthday provides a reason to celebrate a life marked by compassion and Christian witness. I wish him many more years of faithful service.</paragraph>
