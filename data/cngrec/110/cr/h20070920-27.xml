  <narrative>FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10637]</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee resumed its sitting.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the Republican leader of the Aviation Subcommittee, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400318" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us who are frequent travelers as we go back and forth to our districts know the strain that is on our air traffic system. We all hear from outraged constituents who have had enough of delays and of cancellations. The American Society of Civil Engineers periodically issues an infrastructure report  card. In 2005, aviation received only a D-plus. We're in a bad situation and it is only going to get worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traffic is predicted to grow over 4 percent per year until we reach 1 billion passengers by 2015. Air cargo is growing at a rate of more than 5 percent per year. We have a general aviation community that is unique and more active than any other country in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us increases Federal investment in aviation infrastructure with funding for the Airport Improvement Program which provides grants from the aviation trust fund for airport improvements, increased to a total of $15.8 billion over 4 years. The Facilities and Equipment program is increased to $13 billion. We also increase the cap on the level of passenger facility charges that an airport can impose for capacity and safety projects. This cap was last raised 7 years ago and the $4.50  then is now only worth $2.86 due to the incredibly high construction cost inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important initiatives under way at the FAA is the modernization of our air traffic control system, known as NextGen. We must move away from an antique 50-year-old ground-based technology to a modern satellite-based system in order to increase capacity, lower costs and increase safety. The bill seeks to move this process along while instilling accountability. Congress will need to provide effective oversight to be sure the program stays on track and that we have the financial resources  for this $15 to $20 billion multi-year program to keep it moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, there are a variety of other provisions too numerous to enumerate which improve on safety, provide for noise mitigation and enhance other environmental initiatives. The mandatory retirement age for pilots would be increased from age 60 to 65. Passenger rights would be enhanced by ensuring that airlines plan for the care of passengers who are held hostage on tarmacs and will seek to avoid such occurrences by establishing a process to avoid clear overscheduling that inevitably leads  to delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am placed in the rather odd position of voting "no" on final passage for my subcommittee's bill. Though the base bill was put together on a bipartisan basis, two amendments were adopted by the committee which cause me grave concern for the long-term prospects of this bill. We have it on good authority that the bill will be vetoed if section 601 regarding contract impasse procedures is not revised. The current provision provides for changes in future impasse procedures, which I don't  object to; but then it also reopens the currently imposed contract and includes back pay under terms of the 1998 contract. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of this provision in 2008 is $179 million, and $477 million over the life of the bill. The FAA estimates a total cost as high as $1.9 billion over 5 years and $7.5 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, an amendment was adopted that would move express carriers from being covered by the Railway Labor Act to the National Labor Relations Act. This provision is really targeted at one company, FedEx. FedEx Express was organized as and still is an air carrier, in particular an express carrier. As such, it has been covered by the Railway Labor Act since its creation in 1971. Yes, it has trucks, but it is a fully integrated system which was reaffirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Some  draw comparisons to UPS, another great and innovative company for which we all have the greatest respect and, yes, even affection. But UPS organized a hundred years ago as a truck company and as such is rightly covered by the National Labor Relations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairman Costello, and Ranking Member Mica for working together as best we could, sometimes working through basic philosophical differences. I thank the staff for the many hours they have put into helping to produce this bill. Finally, I appreciate the cooperation of the Science Committee for its contribution of the research provisions and the Ways and Means Committee for extending the aviation taxes that fund much of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today we are considering <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, which will reauthorize our aviation programs for the next 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of us here are experienced air travelers, as we fly back and forth to our districts each week. We all know the capacity crunch our air system is experiencing--both on the ground and in the air. All of us are dealing with outraged constituents who are tired of delays, cancelled flights, or being held hostage for hours at a time while a plane sits on the tarmac.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to invest and make improvements to our air transportation system:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air passenger demand is predicted to grow 4.3 percent each year through 2015--resulting in 1 billion passengers annually by 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of aircraft to be handled by air traffic control is expected to grow from 45.1 million in 2004 to 48.5 million in 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air cargo is growing at a rate of more than 5 percent a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the FAA and other experts, $9 billion to $15 billion in capital investment is needed per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aviation is critical to our economic vitality. The commercial aviation industry is responsible for 8 percent of our GDP. It creates and sustains more than 10 million jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a sector that is so critical to our future, you would think a safe and efficient air transportation system would be one of our top national priorities. And yet, the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2005 infrastructure report card gives aviation a grade of only a D+.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007 will take important steps to address these problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It increases investment in aviation infrastructure, authorizing $15.8 billion over 4 years for the Airport Improvement Program (AlP) which provides grants to airports for needed airport expansion and development. The Facilities and Equipment program provides needed air navigation systems and funding is increased in this bill to $13 billion over 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we need to expand capacity on the ground, we also need to do so in the air. The air traffic control modernization program, known as NextGen, will move us from a ground-based radar system to a satellite-based system. Rather than verbally direct every movement of every plane, air traffic controllers will manage traffic and become involved with specific aircraft only as needed. We will be able to handle the increasing air traffic that we know is coming without a huge increase in controllers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> also addresses the issue of passenger rights, as has been demanded by angry passengers who feel they have been abused. The issue of delays, flight schedules and flight diversions is a complicated one. The bill includes a variety of consumer provisions, including requiring airlines to have contingency plans on how they will respond when planes are excessively delayed, including ensuring that trapped passengers are properly cared for. The FAA must approve the plans and can impose civil  penalties. The FAA administrator also is directed to work with airlines when there is clear evidence that the number of flights scheduled exceeds the maximum capacity of the airport--a situation that almost guarantees excessive delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> will improve safety and enhance environmental protection. The number of aviation safety inspectors will be increased, funds for runway incursion reduction programs are increased and other safety programs are strengthened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are addressing environmental issues by requiring the phase-out in 5 years of noisy Stage II jet aircraft so those who live around airports can enjoy at least a little more peace and less noise overhead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to increase fuel efficiency and decrease emissions, several innovative programs and pilots are established. For example, the Aircraft Departure Queue Management Pilot Program authorizes 5 airports to employ new traffic flow management technologies to better manage the movement of aircraft on the ground. The goal is to reduce ground holds and idling times--leading to reduced emissions and increased fuel savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CLEEN Partnership is a 10-year cooperative agreement for the development and certification of lower energy, emissions and noise, engine and airframe technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the more popular provisions would raise the age at which commercial pilots must retire from the current age 60 to age 65. This will put the United States in line with international standards. In this day and age, age 60 retirement is really an anachronism, and we need to update and modernize this requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support the vast majority of the provisions in this bill, and we did work together on a bipartisan basis to develop the base bill, I find myself in the odd position of having to vote "no" on final passage of our reauthorization bill. This is primarily because of two provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, section 601 of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> amends contract impasse procedures and also effectively  overturns a contract implemented last year. I agree that the current contract impasse procedures that were instituted in the 1996 personnel reforms needs to be revised. I will not oppose revising the impasse procedure. In fact, a binding arbitration resolution solution may be the right solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that the provision also reopens the currently imposed contract and includes back pay from 2005 until negotiations are completed. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of this provision in fiscal year 2008 is $179 million and $477 million over the life of the bill. FAA estimates a total cost as high as $1.9 billion over 5 years and $7.5 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want a reauthorization enacted--and I do--this provision jeopardizes that goal. It has been made pretty clear to us that  including the retroactive provisions will invite a presidential veto. And we may even have a problem getting to conference, based on the comments of some Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when this bill passes today--as I expect it will--we need to realize that more negotiation and compromise will be needed to actually get a bill that can be signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, section 806 would amend the labor law that covers the employees of FedEx Express. This has been an issue that has arisen on occasion here in the Congress. The simple fact is that FedEx Express, since its inception in 1971, has been and remains an air carrier--in particular an express carrier. FedEx trucks are fully integrated into the air express activities--and even the Ninth Circuit Court has found this to be the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The press enjoys characterizing this as a FedEx versus UPS fight. It is not. No member wants to pick sides between two innovative and successful companies. But UPS is a motor carrier subject to the National Labor Relations Act. It has been for the last 100 years. The two companies have a very different corporate structure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some continue to make reference to 1996 law that "changed" coverage of FedEx Express to the Railway Labor Act. This is misleading. In fact, a conforming amendment in the ICC Termination Act of 1995 had the inadvertent effect of potentially changing the labor law that would apply to FedEx Express from the Railway Labor Act to the National Labor Relations Act. No discussion on this issue was ever held during consideration of the bill, and there was no conscious decision made to effect that change  in the ICC Termination Act. The 1996 legislation--which was championed by former Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina--simply corrected that inadvertent error. FedEx has been covered by the Railway Labor Act since 1971. It is unfortunate this bill would ignore all that has gone on before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me commend my Committee leadership for working together under what has frequently been some difficult times. There are some issues that we simply disagree on, but we have tried to continue to work toward the goal of getting a reauthorization in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to express thanks to the Science Committee for its contribution of the research title and to the Ways and Means Committee for the tax title. I am pleased that Ways and Means rejected moving to a user fee-based financing scheme in favor of the current more efficient fuel tax program. Taxes are raised for general aviation and corporate jets, and we should note that these groups are accepting and supportive of the increase, knowing that the system requires it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am pleased that we are moving forward. We need to invest in aviation infrastructure. We need to modernize our air traffic control system to increase capacity and improve safety. We need to address the environmental challenge facing the industry today. We need to ensure that our aviation system remains safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has always been the leader around the world in aviation innovation--but I fear that position may be threatened. We must continue to lead and set the standard for the rest of the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel). I thank him for the cooperation and the splendid support the committee has given in the furtherance of this legislation in their extremely important responsibility.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="">
    <paragraph>Fellow Members, I want to thank Chairman Costello and Chairman Oberstar for their cooperation and working together as a team with our Republican colleagues to get this job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite frankly, I thought it was almost going to be pro forma when I knew that the Ways and Means Committee was going to receive this bill for the purposes of providing revenue. So I was a little surprised that when the issue actually came before the full committee, rather than dealing with the question of revenue, I had to deal with the question of outrage. There was not a liberal, conservative, Republican or Democrat that didn't believe that this was our time to tell these aviation people that  we passengers have been suffering in such a way that we were going to express it through the tax system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>People on the tarmac for 3, 4, 5 hours; flights being cancelled; weather conditions we never heard of; overcrowding. And we were of the belief that when they came to raising the revenue, that General Aviation, these small planes were congesting the airs and we were going to make them pay dearly for it, and Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello was asking us to take a deep breath. I told them it wasn't me. But the committee said that this bill is not going to leave our committee  unless we have some fingerprints on this thing to let them know that we feel the outrage for our constituents and we want them to know it. And so we made the political mistake of having Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello come to a caucus and to share with us what the problem was. It was one of those times that you really felt better if you didn't know the extent of the problem and just did what you were supposed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had the people explain that, yes, we have problems with General Aviation, but these commercial airlines are having these routes being filled with smaller planes and so they are filling the air. And then FAA was saying that we have a plan that will go in effect for 2020, but we don't have enough money to implement it. And then the air traffic controller said, and we need 2 or 3 years to train our people and they won't pay us for it. And then they said that they could handle twice the congestion  in the air if only they had more landing fields, but geographically there was no space for additional landing fields. And so then we said: What is it you really want, Chairman Oberstar?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have really walked away thanking them for incorporating some of the ideas of our committee, as MIKE THOMPSON and LLOYD DOGGETT, and having the Passengers Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we want the FAA to know that these long-ranged plans of modernization, for those of us that are in advanced years, we don't really believe that we are going to have to wait in order for us to be treated as human beings. Not as congresspeople, not as big shots, not as VIPs, but we know that changes can be made. And we will be depending on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to continue to work with us to make certain that we fulfill our commitment to the American people to make  it easier for us to use the airways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to working with you.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to stand and say I am pleased today that the rule will provide one amendment that CHRIS SHAYS from Connecticut and myself also brought to the committee yesterday, but I also want to take this 1 minute to say that I had been hopeful that we could have had a vote on another amendment which would have delayed the FAA's New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia airspace redesign until a further study could have concluded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, Mr. Chairman, the air routes, in an attempt to cut delays, means that thousands of residents will be exposed to new levels of aircraft noise and pollution. There is great concern in townships throughout my district that these new routes will negatively impact upon the quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA claims to have looked into alternative options to decrease airline delays, but all those options dealt with changing the design of the airspace and reroutes over quiet neighborhoods; yet the FAA has admitted that many of the frustrating delays are caused not by airplane congestion but by airline overscheduling. The amendment that unfortunately did not come out of Rules would have required that the FAA look into those matters before  proceeding.  But, again, I am appreciative of the fact that what did come out of Rules, an amendment that we will be discussing a little later on to allow for further studies by the GAO.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler), speaking on behalf of the Committee of Science and Technology, and thank them for their contributions to the legislation. Their role is the research and development portion of FAA's operations, and they made a significant and very healthy beneficial contribution. The gentleman from Kentucky will speak on behalf of the Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400442" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman, the gentleman from Minnesota, for all his good work on this bill. We think it is an excellent bill. And I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois, for all of his good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to express the support of the Science Committee for this bill. I am especially pleased that this legislation includes the FAA Aviation Safety Research Assessment Act, which I introduced this past June. This bill is now section 913 of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aviation safety is extremely important to me, particularly after the tragic Comair crash that occurred in my own district in Lexington, Kentucky last August, which saw 49 dearly loved people lose their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Comair crash made it clear that improved safety measures are needed to save lives. Section 913 calls for an independent assessment of the FAA's aviation safety-related research programs, in particular, those that focus on preventing runway incursions and lessening air traffic control workloads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NTSB's investigation of the Comair crash brought to light several safety advisories that were not being followed, including the FAA's recommendation that two controllers should have been in the tower instead of one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Repeatedly, I have called for enhanced safety measures, better staffing, and improved working conditions for our air traffic controllers. Thankfully, this bill provides funding for air traffic control equipment and facility upgrades, and also includes language that would send the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and the FAA back to the negotiating table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the bill provides $42 million for runway incursion reduction programs, $74 million for runway light improvements, and requires the FAA to implement systems to alert controllers and flight crews of potential runway incursions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is precisely the type of safety technology that we need to prevent these tragedies, and I thank the gentlemen for all of their good work.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield myself 2 3/4  minutes and recognize the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, the dean of the House, Mr. Dingell.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I accept the time with thanks to my beloved friend from Minnesota for whom I have enormous affection and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, southeastern Michigan is the home for two major airports that accommodate large amounts of air and cargo traffic, Detroit Metro and Willow Run Airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Southeast Michigan has made strong efforts to develop an aerotropolis between the two airports, and we meet all of the tests that would be required for this, including rail, truck, highway, water, and other kinds of access. We believe that these would be very useful in establishing an intermodal access program which would complement these efforts by facilitating the many public transit plans in southeast Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I request at this time the assurance of my beloved friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, that he will be helping us on this, and I assure him that I will be requesting the assurance of the chairman of the Wayne County Airport Authority that he will cooperate fully in giving priority consideration to this matter to move it forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) who has been so active in this matter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Detroit Metropolitan Airport is a prime candidate for both an aerotropolis and participation in this program due to its importance as the Midwest jumping off point to Southeast Asia, as a world-renowned manufacturing center, and as an international highway crossroads. At its peak, the aerotropolis could create up to 60,000 jobs for southeast Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also request the support of the chairman in assuring that Wayne County Airport Authority receives priority consideration under section 114, and I thank the gentleman from Michigan, the dean of the House, for the time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Transit Administration recently approved a $700 million Full Funding Grant Agreement for the construction of a new Dallas area rapid transit rail line that will provide access to the vicinity of Dallas Love Field Airport, not direct access to the main terminal. So to remedy this connection lapse, the city of Dallas and the Council of Governments have committed some funding, but the city has a strong desire to use PFCs to cover the remainder of the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respectfully ask the distinguished chairman to work with me to ensure that Dallas Love Field Airport receives priority consideration for the program outlined in section 114 of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I assure the gentleman from Michigan, the gentlewoman from Michigan, and the gentlewoman from Texas that these projects are of great importance. They are examples of the type of projects we envisioned when we crafted section 114. Dallas Love Field and Wayne County Airport Authority are well suited to participate in the pilot project, and I would urge FAA to give consideration to both applications.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am rising out of concern about a serious safety problem at the Santa Monica General Aviation Airport in my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Santa Monica Airport is a unique facility. It was built in 1922 and has no runway safety areas which are now required by the FAA to enable a safe landing in the event that an aircraft overshoots the runway or fails to lift off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The airport's single runway is bordered by steep hills, public streets, and densely populated neighborhoods, with homes as close as 250 feet from the runway. As traffic has increased, so have concerns that any plane overshooting the runway would be at great risk of landing in the neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 7 years, I have worked with the City of Santa Monica and the Airport Administration to push the FAA to address this serious safety problem. Regrettably, the FAA has been unwilling to take meaningful action. The FAA recently issued a final decision to permit only minor runway changes that are far below FAA standards and would do little to change the status quo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to ask Chairman Oberstar to work with me and the FAA to find a solution that is consistent with FAA design guidelines for the Santa Monica Airport and adequately addresses the safety needs of all aircraft categories that use the airport.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for raising that issue. Lack of a runway safety area on an airport is a critical gap, a serious gap in the safety features of an airport, and I assure the gentleman we will invite the Santa Monica Airport Authority, with the gentleman's participation, and the Office of Airports of FAA to come in to  have a discussion about the safety needs of this airport and funding them within the airport's master plan into the future.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank you for your willingness to try to bring us all together. I just want to emphasize that time is of the essence here. We need to do all we can to make operations at Santa Monica Airport safer for the pilots, passengers, and people on the ground. We may need legislative changes in that regard.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure to thank our distinguished chairman, Mr. Oberstar, for your expertise on these very important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 flew directly over New York's Indian Point Nuclear Facility on its way to the World Trade Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>One year later, a taped interview on al-Jazeera indicated that al Qaeda initially planned to include a nuclear plant as one of its targets. The Indian Point nuclear power plant is less than 50 miles from New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA's post-September 11 no fly zone around the plant was lifted in November 2001. Since that time, I've worked with my Hudson Valley colleagues to protect Indian Point from any potential terrorist threat, including calling for a no fly zone around the facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will the chairman commit to working with me to ensure that both the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration are protecting the airspace around this facility and protecting the more than 20 million people who live near Indian Point from all aviation threats?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady and associate myself with my colleague's remarks and thank her for her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indian Point's location in the most populated, most targeted area of the country, makes it absolutely critical that we take every step to secure the plant. I would reiterate my colleague's question, and ask the chairman if he would please work with us on this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for raising this issue, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hall) as well. This is a matter of very great concern, and you've raised a matter of national security significance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA does have administrative authority to declare a no fly zone, but would do so in this situation, in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security to identify the threat, establish the need for restrictions on aircraft operations, and the FAA would then issue the order. I pledge to the gentlewoman and to the gentleman that we'll bring both Departments, Transportation and Homeland Security, together with the delegation from New York to discuss this matter and to do so in a bipartisan  fashion, because there are Republican Members who have asked about this matter as well, and begin the process, orderly and appropriately, of designating a no fly zone.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we have a distinguished Member from Tennessee on the other side of the aisle who needs some time, and we have some extra time, so I'm pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) and welcome his commentary.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2007, which would authorize $66 billion for Federal aviation programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would provide for the Airport Improvement Program, for FAA facilities and equipment to accelerate the implementation of NextGen, which will enable the FAA to replace and repair existing air traffic control facilities and equipment, as well as to provide for the development of high priority safety-related systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say, however, Mr. Chairman, that I'm extremely disappointed that this legislation includes language that would abolish 80 years of legislative and legal precedent by allowing FedEx Express workers to unionize under the National Labor Relations Act, as opposed to the Railway Labor Act which has traditionally covered all airline employees. And the Ninth Circuit United States District Court in California has reemphasized that, and it's the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FedEx Express is the largest employer and economic driving force of the city of Memphis, which is predominantly the Ninth Congressional District, which I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision raises a number of questions and concerns regarding the consequences of this precedent for other carrier employees and employers, and it could have been addressed during a hearing on the subject. Unfortunately, in a marked departure from T&amp;I Subcommittee's normal practice, no hearings were held on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I speak in opposition to FedEx Express language, not as an opponent of workers' rights to collective bargaining, but as an advocate of what I believe are the best economic interests of Tennessee's Ninth Congressional District and this Nation, which needs a steady stream of interstate commerce provided through the Railway Labor Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I signed on as an original cosponsor of this legislation because I support the vast majority of its provisions, including the language added by Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Costello, which provides for consumer rights, environmental and noise concerns, safety issues and flight attendant, air traffic controller and pilot work conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the committee chairman and the Aviation Subcommittee chairman, as well as the committee ranking members for their hard work on this bill in bringing together an effective measure that includes input from a great number of expert stakeholders across the airline industry. The overall content of this bill is sound, and I believe the few provisions about which I remain concerned will be addressed in the conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I would yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairmen OBERSTAR and COSTELLO and Ranking Members MICA and PETRI for their hard work in bringing this bill to the floor. This bill could not come at a better time for the traveling public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airlines on-time performance is at its lowest rate since the Department of Transportation began keeping records in 1995. And this is happening at the same time that the Department of Transportation is predicting a tripling of passenger and cargo by 2025. This is why we need this bill passed so we can provide funds for increased capacity, safety enhancements, and overall system improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses an important issue in my district by preserving the Military Airport Program, MAP, as a set-aside within the Airport Improvement Program. The MAP program provides critical support to those communities which have been given the responsibility of converting closed military bases to civilian use. The participation of the Cecil Field Airport, which is just outside of Jacksonville, is a prime example of how this program can successfully translate former military airfields to commercial  service that, in turn, have strengthened the Nation's aviation system and, in the case of  Cecil Field, also continues to include uses by the Air National Guard and Reserve units, making this a win-win for the community and for the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MAP grants also support projects that are generally not eligible for AIP funds, but which are typically needed for successful civilian conversion such as surface parking lots, fuel farms, hangars, utility systems, access roads, and cargo buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank the chairman for guiding this bill to the floor, and I would encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the administration proposed a punitive fee structure aimed at the heart of general aviation; and, ironically, they would have decreased the funding needed for an already congested and overburdened system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill gets us the investment we need to deal with congestion, to deal with the Next Generation air traffic control. It would allow us to partner with the airports who need to deal with their problems through an increase in passenger facility charge. It has fair treatment for the most critical component of the people who keep us alive, the air traffic controllers of America who are being demeaned by petty work rules by this administration and having their pay cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives long overdue protection to cabin flight attendants and the passengers who fly in those cabins in terms of workplace health and cabin safety. It has critical consumer protection for the first time, something that's been ignored for years here on the Hill under the Republican leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will provide security for overseas repair. Most Americans would be shocked to know that people, we don't know who they are, overseas are doing the majority of heavy work on our airplanes. This bill would begin to turn that around. And this bill does much, much more. Congratulations to the committee on their great work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute and say I have the greatest respect for the gentleman who just spoke, but I think the facts are a little bit different on cutting the air traffic controllers' compensation. This chart, in fact, shows an 81 percent salary increase since 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, also, there's a disparity now of almost 40 percent between air traffic controllers and other FAA employees in what they receive as far as increases. So that just doesn't jibe with the facts. And I have the respect of the air traffic controllers, and they should be adequately compensated, and I'll support that. But we can't do an unprecedented reach-back and try to do something that's not fair to everyone.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400289" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill which contains many excellent provisions. But I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairman Costello, in particular, for including in the manager's amendment two provisions that are particularly important to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first requires the FAA to conduct a study to determine if temperature standards are necessary to protect crew members and passengers from excessive heat on board aircraft. We've all heard the news reports about passengers on planes grounded for hours sometimes in the heat without fresh air and necessary supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Association of Flight Attendants reports that many crew members have had to work in dangerously high temperatures during ground operations for long periods of time with no ability to obtain relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this is not just a matter of discomfort. Heat-related illness can be severe, can even lead to death, particularly for sensitive populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My first inclination was to require that the temperature in the aircraft must not exceed 80 degrees during ground operations, but various operational issues make it clear that such a requirement would be premature. I hope that this study will inform Congress of what options are available to us and that it will force the FAA to take seriously this serious problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision would mandate the FAA to complete a study of the cabin air quality that we required in the last FAA reauthorization bill passed in 2003. Aircraft in the current commercial fleet are equipped with air circulation systems that bleed air off the engines and are subject to contamination of the air by engine oil and hydraulic fluids. We continue to hear reports from crew members and passengers who have developed long-term neurological problems after documented exposure to oil  smoke in the cabin or on the flight deck. In the last reauthorization bill, we included a study to sample and analyze the air on board the cabin aircraft. Unfortunately, the FAA never completed the study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My preference, again, would be to set standards for cabin air quality now or to require that aircraft use certain filters that can clean the outside air more efficiently. But every time we raise this issue, we hear that the problem has not been properly documented. It is time, and this bill requires that the FAA complete this research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Costello for their support of these provisions and for including them in the manager's amendment. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance these critical workplace and consumer protections, so that people can breathe the air and not faint from the heat. And I urge support for this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield, at this time, 3 1/2  minutes, and ask also the Chair of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, if he would join me in this time as I yield to Mr. Garrett for the purpose of a colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair and I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman as well for this opportunity to engage in this colloquy. I'd like to thank my friend from Florida for your advice and your assistance on this matter with regard to the New Jersey and New York airspace redesign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) knows the issue firsthand because he has traveled up to New Jersey last year and knows of its importance as a top concern for the residents of north Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I need to reiterate my concerns with the FAA's record of decision-making regarding this design plan. The alternative chosen by the FAA will reroute planes over areas that used to be quiet communities in an effort to reduce delays and air congestion. But because of this, thousands of residents in north Jersey will soon have planes flying over their homes for the first time ever. And these citizens are justifiably concerned that the increase in noise and pollution and affecting their quality of  life will be negative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, over 1,400 of these concerned citizens showed up at an FAA meeting to make their concerns known to the design plan. Unfortunately, the FAA did not listen to their concerns and they published their record anyway earlier this month. The FAA chose this plan because they believe it will achieve their goal of reducing delays. Despite all attempts by myself, other colleagues, local officials, there was no attempt at all to balance this goal with the needs of the citizens of the area.  There was also no attempt to consider other factors such as airline overscheduling and the size of the planes flying in and out of the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Only air routes were studied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that the legislation we have before us today attempts to deal with the problem of overscheduling, and it would be my hope that the FAA will continue to review the New Jersey airspace issues with an eye towards these less-intrusive solutions to the delay problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate, then, the support and assistance of the chairman and the ranking member to determine if there are other practical steps that can be taken to decrease the noise and, therefore, to increase the quality of life that this will incur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield now to the gentleman from Florida.</paragraph>

We look forward to the amendment later on today with regards to the GAO report that will finally put the information right before the FAA. They can't look any other way. They haven't listened  to our constituents. Maybe they will listen to the GAO report, and I am sure, absolutely sure, that they will listen to the chairman and the ranking member.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the support of the chairman and ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 10 years, the FAA has been working on the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan area airspace redesign project. In the time that I and Representative Andrews from New Jersey have been working on this issue, it has become increasingly clear to us that the process by which it was conducted is deeply flawed. We are gravely concerned that the FAA has failed to conduct an accurate cost-benefit analysis that takes into account the full cost of this project, including social  costs such as the impact of noise on the educational development, health, safety, and property values to dense residential communities, including many in Delaware County in my congressional district, as well as Camden and Gloucester Counties in Representative Andrews' congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the 2005 Department of Transportation Inspector General report and as former FAA Administrator Marion Blakely indicated to us, the cost effectiveness and operational efficiency gained by the airspace redesign is still largely unknown, and, quite frankly, "the juice is not worth the squeeze."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleagues Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello for supporting a Government Accountability Office study to provide a comprehensive assessment of the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia metropolitan area airspace redesign, including its cost, schedule, estimate reliability, environmental impact, and lessons learned for improvement. This is particularly important since GAO provides an independent cost-benefit analysis of this plan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman and subcommittee chairman, Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Costello, and their staff for the good work they did on this bill, but, more specifically, for including provisions from my passengers' bill of rights legislation into the manager's amendment, which will become part of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions are going to set a standard that will ensure the flying public will be treated appropriately when they experience delays. It will require a deplaning plan and standard. And when delayed on the tarmac, it will ensure that these folks have clean and safe water, proper air circulation, and clean and working restrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great success for the flying public, and I want to thank everyone for making this happen. But I want to remind everyone that our job is not done. We are going to have to continue to provide the oversight to ensure that the airlines and Department of Transportation do their jobs and that these provisions do, in fact, provide the protections that these people flying deserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Chairman Oberstar, thank you first for your leadership on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and for bringing forward this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, this past February GAO reported that the very unique airport which is closest to our Nation's capital, National Airport, is underutilized. In fact, the GAO reported that National Airport is the least congested airport of the top 30 in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Residents of my Upstate New York district want to continue visiting our Nation's capital for business or pleasure at a reasonable airfare. However, because a very few airlines control the vast majority of landing and takeoff slots at National, that is artificially limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, like all of my colleagues, I appreciate your strong leadership and guidance on aviation issues and your genuine concern for regional interests. I therefore respectfully request that you strongly consider adopting findings of GAO's conclusive report and increase flying at National Airport by a very modest two round trips per hour so that new competition can be added, so that fares can be decreased.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The fact of the matter is that we have approached the bulk of our work in a strong bipartisan way. We worked on the underlying bill in that spirit. Unfortunately, there are several provisions that are controversial and would impede our ability to actually get work through the whole process and signed by the President that were added in the full committee. But let there be no doubt that our country needs to get this legislation passed to accommodate new investment in our aviation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are at the brink of rolling out a new generation of technology to accommodate the growth, to increase efficiency and safety in that system, be it a 15-, 20-, maybe 25-year multimillion dollar system. Doing that will increase the capacity of the system. We will maintain America's lead in aviation on a global basis and having that framework in place so that the administrators and the industries involved can plan with reduced uncertainty, which is very, very important. We are already late with  this legislation. The current program is scheduled to expire at the end of this month. We will probably be doing a short-term extension. But we do need a reauthorization to proceed in a way that can be brought to a successful conclusion and signed by our President.

We appreciate the participation of the members on the Republican side. Mr. Mica has given a considerable amount of his time from all the other issues that we have to deal with in committee. The gentleman from Wisconsin has been a quick learner and a very astute participant in both the hearings and the markup process.  And the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello) has really put his arms around the subject of aviation, mastered the issues, and brought forth an extraordinary piece of legislation that will serve aviation well and serve the Nation well out into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we have disagreement principally on two issues, and we have been open and candid about that right from the outset. We have worked cooperatively, bipartisanly to try to resolve the air traffic controller issue. Both parties seemed irreconcilable. We have created a process in this legislation by which the air traffic controller issue can be resolved with an arbitration process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And I think that's in the best interest of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we go forward from here, I look forward to the amendments that will be forthcoming, and I think in a very constructive manner we can conclude the action on this bill today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill of 2007, <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This summer's record delays at many of our Nation's airports have made it evident that our air traffic control system is in desperate need of reform. According to the FAA, 25 percent of flights arrived late, nearly 3 percent of flights were cancelled and customer complaints doubled since last year. My central New Jersey constituents who use Newark Liberty International Airport suffer from the worst delays in the country with only 55 percent of flights arriving on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today will give the FAA the tools it needs in order to reduce these delays and help increase flight safety. It will provide the much needed funding to modernize our aging air traffic control system and to strengthen and rebuild airport infrastructure. It will require the FAA to meet with airport officials and airlines to ensure flight reductions in areas where over-scheduling is causing chronic delays. This bill will make sure that there are the adequate consumer protections  in place to protect our Nation's airline passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few of us have forgotten the February 14, 2007 and December 29, 2006 incidents where hundreds of airline passengers were held on tarmacs for up to 10 hours in appalling conditions. These passengers were held in planes with foul air, backed up toilets, little food and water, and no information. The legislation before us today will ensure that these situations will be avoided in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> requires airlines and airports to have emergency contingency plans to take care of passengers that are involved in long tarmac delays. Through these plans it will mandate that these passengers have access to food, water, clean restrooms, medical care and requires that passengers are allowed to deplane. It also requires the Department of Transportation to enact regulations that will require airlines to fairly compensate passengers whose flights are cancelled. These commonsense protections  will make sure that the airlines respect the basic needs and rights of passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill of 2007 contains a number of other provisions which will improve the way that our aviation industry operates. It will help protect our environment through requiring the development of more efficient engines that release less greenhouse gases into the air as well as directs the FAA to develop more energy efficient routes. Our Nation's air traffic controllers work long and stress-filled hours to ensure that we have the safest air travel in  the world. This bill ensures that the FAA will be forced to come back to the contract negotiating table. It will also increase the number of aviation safety inspectors by one third, require the FAA to be more accountable, and improve the security of aircraft repair stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the FAA Reauthorization bill of 2007.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400631" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we debate <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, I want to highlight a critical flight safety and water quality issue--glycol recovery. As airports work to comply with existing and future stormwater requirements under the Clean Water Act, there is a critical need to find a cost-effective means of reducing the impact of deicing operations on water quality without compromising safety. Glycol recovery vehicles are an available, cost-effective solution that provides  superior environmental protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its Source Water Protection Bulletin regarding airport deicing, the EPA states that "vacuum vehicles are a cost-effective alternative to installing traditional drainage collection systems or deicing pads." In addition, glycol recovery vehicles reduce airport delays by  allowing deicing to occur at the gate rather than requiring planes to travel through a deicing facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there appears to be confusion among the airports as to whether the purchase of glycol recovery vehicles is an eligible expense under the AlP. I have been advised by the FAA that glycol recovery vehicles are currently eligible for purchase using AlP funding under existing statutory authority. However, despite this interpretation, FAA grant summaries show that over the last 7 years, there has been only one case where a glycol recovery vehicle was purchased using AlP funds and that  was classified as snow removal equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to confirm that glycol recovery vehicles are in fact eligible for AlP funding, I joined Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Costello and Representative TIMOTHY JOHNSON in sending a letter to FAA Acting Administrator Sturgell. Our letter dated September 20, which I will submit to the RECORD, asked for a response in writing describing the means by which airports have been informed that glycol recovery vehicles are eligible for AlP funding, as well as actions that  the FAA plans to take in the future to inform airports of such eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues for their support and look forward to a prompt response from the FAA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, September 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR ACTING ADMINISTRATOR STURGELL: As Congress continues the process of reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), we are seeking clarification of our understanding that glycol recovery vehicles are eligible for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding. Unfortunately, there appears to be confusion among the airports as to whether their purchase of glycol recovery vehicles is an eligible expense under the AIP. We have been advised by the FAA that such vehicles are currently  eligible for purchase using AIP funding under existing statutory authority. We concur and respectfully request that you respond to this letter in writing describing the means by which airports have been informed that glycol recovery vehicles are eligible for AIP funding, as well as actions that the FAA plans to take in the future to inform airports of such eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you are aware, aircraft and runway deicing operations are a critical element of aviation safety. Currently, glycol-based aircraft deicing fluid is the most widely used technique for maintaining Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) deicing safety standards. However, glycol runoff, if not contained, can pose a significant threat to water systems. In its Source Water Protection Bulletin regarding airport deicing, the Environmental Protection Agency states, "Vacuum vehicles are a cost-effective  alternative to installing traditional drainage collection systems or deicing pads." In addition, glycol recovery vehicles can reduce airport delays by allowing deicing to occur at the gate rather than requiring planes to travel through a deicing facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, as airports work to maintain these safety standards and protect water quality while performing deicing operations, we believe it is important that they be made aware of all tools available for funding through the AIP. Glycol recovery vehicles are one of these tools and are an available, cost-effective solution that provides superior environmental protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you in advance for your prompt action to clarify confusion among AIP users as to the eligibility of glycol recovery vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry Costello,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Nation's aviation system is in crisis. Delays have reached the highest levels in 13 years and the air traffic control system is groaning under the weight of a system based on 1950s technologies. The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2007 takes the first steps towards reducing these delays, improving airport infrastructure and creating a satellite-based air traffic control system. I want to thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Subcommittee Chairman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986 Congress granted "full power and dominion over, and complete discretion in, operation and development of the Airports" to a regional authority. In return the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia agreed to take operational control and have raised more than $3 billion to modernize National and Dulles airports. All agree that the regional authority, the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, has done an excellent job. However, FAA Reauthorization legislation is almost always  dogged by attempts, usually in the Senate, to increase flights outside the perimeter and inside the perimeter for Reagan Washington National Airport. MWAA has balanced concerns of safety, security and efficiency at these airports. National has avoided some of the delays that plague other airports and served the region in a comprehensive way, while Dulles has thrived as an international and national hub. We must allow professionals to do what only professionals are equipped to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the only regional member of the Aviation Subcommittee I have argued to maintain the current perimeter and slot system and thank both Chairman OBERSTAR and Subcommittee Chairman COSTELLO for supporting me and the region. Regional members and I have been successful in keeping amendments from being brought today and now it is time for Members to cease interfering for their own convenience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current reauthorization legislation shifts some outside-the-perimeter slots to better times and offers the slots to new entrants at National. This reordering of slots could increase competition and entice low-cost carriers to National, an airport where current airlines command a premium disadvantaging residents of the region. I hope that new entrants will help this region obtain quality low-fare carriers at National Airport for residents of the District of Columbia and the region who use  National but are priced out of the major destinations inside the perimeter such as New York, Miami and Boston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other unfinished business of the Transportation and Security Administration that affects the FAA at National Airport still remains at National. Before 9/11 National averaged 600 general aviation/charter operations a week. However, since the new security program initiated in October 2005 only 200 general aviation aircraft have flown into National. The requirements of this security program have been unduly burdensome, while at other New York airports, general aviation has returned to its previous  levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Aviation Subcommittee will hold hearings on this issue so we can continue to work with MWAA on a balanced approach that will benefit the region and the country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2007. This important legislation would usher in important modernizations to our Nation's aging air travel system, bringing air travel in a new direction while making important safety improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, after 9/11, we feared that tragedy would lead to large-scale declines in air travel. Six years later, airline traffic is instead growing, but with this boom have come some negative consequences for passengers. Key among these have been airline delays: The first half of 2007 saw record high numbers of airline delays. Through July, over one-quarter of all flights were delayed, and over 6 percent of flights arrived more than 1 hour late. Projections indicate this problem is likely  only to get worse, with numbers of passengers, operations, and cargo expected to triple by 2025.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to invest now to improve our Nation's air-travel infrastructure. Even more critical than these increasingly inconvenient delays are the growing deficiencies in our aging air traffic control systems. As chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security arid Infrastructure Protection of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am committed to ensuring a maximum level of safety and security for Americans traveling the skies. To this end, I believe that the modernization of air traffic  control and airport infrastructure needs to be a higher priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation recognizes this crucial need. It provides $13 billion to accelerate the implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. This program will enable the FAA to repair and replace existing facilities and equipment, and will also make funds available for implementing other high-priority safety-related systems. In addition, this bill includes a fiscally responsible increase in the general aviation jet fuel tax rate from 21.8 cents per gallon to 35.9 cents per gallon,  and it increases the aviation gasoline tax rate from 19.3 cents per gallon to 24.1 cents per gallon. Crucially, the funds secured by these increases will be dedicated to air traffic control modernization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I believe that safety must lie at the heart of our efforts to improve air travel. You cannot put a price on the value of keeping American travelers safe. This legislation will make important strides toward this important goal by increasing the number of aviation safety inspectors by more than one-third. It will also strengthen efforts to reduce runway incursions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this legislation will increase accountability, by requiring detailed plans for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. It also authorizes GAO and Inspector General audits and reports, which will help reduce cost overruns and delays in the air traffic control modernization program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I support this legislation, and I am extremely pleased that it will include the  amendment offered by my colleagues Mr. LAMPSON and Mr. POE. This amendment eliminates a 55 percent increase in passenger facility charges, which are imposed whenever a passenger passes through an airport. These taxes create a substantial financial burden on travelers, particularly those who must pass through several airports in transit. While  I do not minimize the need for funds to improve airport facilities, I believe there are far more equitable ways of obtaining this funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we work to ensure funding for our Nation's vital air transit system, I look forward to working with the airports to increase contracting opportunities for minority-owned business. As airports embark on important programs of improvement, I call on them to create an even playing field, in which small- and minority-owned businesses can compete for contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, air travel is crucial to many Americans, who rely on safe and rapid transit to conduct business, visit family, or take a family vacation. With ever increasing strains on our air transit system, this important legislation will take air travel in a new direction--providing consumer protections for airline passengers, modernizing infrastructure, improving safety, and reducing delays for people and commerce, fuel consumption, and emissions that cause global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I stand today in strong support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been the worst year on record for air traffic delays. The New York area, which I represent, has three major airports with some of the worst delays in the Nation. Obviously, this situation must change. This amendment would commission a study to determine how best to fix these delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA had a chance to commission such a study, but instead they decided to take a unilateral, misguided approach to redesign the airspace over thousands of residents in my Congressional District. The FAA did this without consulting the very people whose lives would be most affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A study should have been conducted years ago. I support reducing delays, but we should first know if the FAA's actions will improve air travel. It would be a mistake for the FAA to continue on this course without knowing whether the airspace redesign would even reduce delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because today we are affected, tomorrow you could be.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I rise to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first half of 2007 has included the worst record in history for airline delays. So far, more than one quarter of all flights this year have been delayed. Yet, airline traffic is expected to grow at a rapid pace--with a tripling of the number of passengers flying by the year 2025. <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> is an important first step in addressing America's transportation dilemma. It modernizes our aging air traffic control system, and strengthens airport infrastructure to reduce delays and improve safety.  This bill provides the necessary funds to improve America's airport infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> also includes critical consumer protections by creating a Passenger Bill of Rights, which provides for emergency contingency plans and greater oversight by the FAA into flight delays. In the area I represent, southern California, flight delays and congestion are a major problem. <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> provides much needed reforms to help my local airport, the LA/Ontario International Airport, improve its infrastructure--so it may accommodate much of the expected increase in air traffic for the area  in the coming years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These reforms will reduce delays, increase capacity, enhance security, and promote new competition at Ontario airport and ultimately help generate much needed economic development and job growth in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> is vital to modernizing America's air traffic system, reducing flight delays, and ensuring our Nation is prepared for the massive increases in number of flights we will see over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I express my full support of this bill and urge my fellow colleagues to adopt its final passage.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, research and development is absolutely fundamental to the mission of the Federal Aviation Administration, and the bill before us today includes a number of provisions that will ensure the agency's R&amp;D enterprise continues to be robust and productive. Title I of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> reauthorizes the FAA's Research, Engineering and Development program for 4 years at levels that, for the most part, are consistent with the Administration's request. The bill also contains a number  of provisions specific to R&amp;D projects and activities, many of which are consolidated in Title IX, but are also incorporated in other parts of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Aviation Administration is a unique federal enterprise that is fully reliant on maintaining a highly sophisticated network of communications, navigation, and surveillance facilities located at many sites throughout this country. The FAA also regulates the design and operation of the aircraft that fly within our airspace. Our national airspace system, and the economic benefits that flow from it, would not be possible without a well-funded research and development program and a dedicated  staff of scientists and engineers. Research results have led to the development of a huge number of products that continue to improve the safety, efficiency and capacity of our national airways system and the planes that fly in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Science and Technology Committee held oversight hearings early this year in preparation for writing and reporting <bill type="h" number="2698">H.R. 2698</bill>, The Federal Aviation Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2007, and just 3 months ago, on June 22, our committee reported the bill on a voice vote. <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> incorporates virtually all of the bill's provisions, and for that, I want to extend my thanks to the leadership and staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their willingness to work  together on these important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are a number of R&amp;D provisions in this bill, in the time remaining I want to highlight three programs. First and foremost, the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) is working to develop the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) that is--and I say this without any exaggeration--absolutely essential if we are to ensure a vibrant and growing air transportation network. The current system is at capacity and will not be able to accommodate future growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The JPDO is a unique federal collaboration originally authorized in the R&amp;D title of the Vision 100 legislation signed by the President during the 108th Congress. It is led by the FAA and includes a number of other federal agencies, and its role is to coordinate and manage the research, development and implementation of technologies needed to meet future capacity, safety, efficiency, and security requirements for our national airspace system. <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> strengthens management oversight and accountability,  and directs participating federal agencies to assign a senior agency official to be specifically responsible for that agency's role in the development and implementation of NextGen. It also creates a more</paragraph>
    <paragraph>transparent budgeting process to help Congress determine if the Administration is providing amounts needed and requested by JPDO participating agencies. With regard to JPDO's budget, the bill before us is silent on authorization amounts, leaving this and future Congresses with the ability to fund the JPDO as needed. The fact is, at this early stage of development, too little is known about NextGen's cost and budget profile over the decade ahead to develop credible cost estimates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Administration's request, <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> includes a new start called the `CLEEN (Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise engine and airframe technology) research, development and implementation partnership.' The goals of this program are to research and develop technologies capable of significantly reducing emissions and noise produced by turbine-powered aircraft, as well as increasing their fuel efficiency. This legislation directs the FAA  to coordinate its efforts with NASA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation takes important first steps to allow for the safe and routine operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in our national airspace system. All of us know the important capabilities provided by UAS systems in the Middle East. Here at home, these aircraft will vastly improve our ability to monitor our borders, to help communities recover from natural disasters, and take environmental and land-use measurements. But first we need to develop `sense and avoid' technologies,  along with flight control and navigation technologies, so that unmanned aircraft can safely fly in the same airspace used by general aviation and commercial aircraft without threat of collision. <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> gives the FAA the authority to begin the necessary research, plus to develop schedules to meet mandated deadlines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, FAA's research and development activities are essential to its mission, and the features I've described, plus many others in the legislation before us, will strengthen the agency's capabilities to accommodate and manage our Nation's national airspace system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I do want to express reservations about portions of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> unrelated to research and development, and caution Members to carefully weigh the bill in its totality before casting their votes. I clearly understand this bill has some very contentious issues that may, on balance, leave Members no choice but to vote against final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned about provisions in this bill that will impose a variety of new costs on an industry that is still recovering from several years of billion-dollar losses and,  to make matters worse, could delay FAA's ability to replace its aging air traffic control system. To give two examples, <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> would permit up to a 55 percent increase in passenger facilities charges assessed by airports, the costs of which appear as an additional  fee on airline tickets. The bill also voids the current labor-management contract for air traffic controllers, forcing the agency to reinstitute its older--and more expensive--labor contract, and it requires reopening negotiations on a new contract under a new negotiating regime. This labor provision seriously jeopardizes FAA's ability to finance its new air traffic control system, which, by some estimates, could result in an additional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these and other reasons, I cannot, and will not, support <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> in its present form.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400620" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding and I would like to recognize Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman COSTELLO for their exceptional leadership on this critical issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, and urge swift passage of the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many good and important issues addressed in this bill: funding for capital programs; air traffic control modernization and NextGen; financing that doesn't overburden general aviation; safety; the imposed work rules on our air traffic controllers; consumer protections; R&amp;D; environment; and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I'd like to especially thank the bipartisan leadership on the committee for working with me on issues that are particularly important to me and my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> provides increased funding to local governments throughout the country to maintain and develop their airports, which serve as cornerstones for economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides increased radar surveillance coverage in mountainous areas--such as those in Colorado--which will increase the safety and capacity for many of our mountain airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of us come from and represent small, rural communities, we appreciate the need to preserve and improve rural aviation programs, such as Essential Air Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EAS serves rural communities across the country that otherwise would not receive any scheduled air service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the Administration, once again, has proposed to cut funding by more than half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That would be devastating to more than 140 rural communities--including Cortez, Alamosa and Pueblo, Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud of the work that we did on the committee to correct this wrong and I'm pleased to see the improvements made to rural aviation in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> ensures that we remain the world's safest aviation system, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007. I thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman COSTELLO for their leadership and hard work to bring this complex legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are disagreements on certain issues, the bill that emerged from the committee will serve the greater interests for the American people for years to come. I am truly proud to have been part of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Subcommittee on Aviation in developing this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will address a few of the numerous positive provisions of the bill that warrant mention and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One section extends the coverage of OSHA to flight attendants. For all too long--well over 30 years--flight attendants have fought an unsuccessful fight to win basic occupational and health protections available to nearly all other American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite a Memorandum of Understanding in 2000 between FAA and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration to rectify this discriminatory application of employment law, flight attendants are still left without any meaningful safety and health protections. Since the FAA has shown no inclination to follow through on the MOU, it is time for Congress to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day, flight attendants risk exposure to poor air quality, blood-borne viruses including HIV and Hepatitis B, cosmic radiation and noise. They are expected to perform excessive lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying--including carry-on baggage and poorly designed food and beverage carts. Without workplace regulatory protections, flight attendants who are sick and injured have no one to help them. This unacceptable condition threatens not only the health of flight attendants, but the safety  of the hundreds of passengers who depend on flight attendants for many in-flight services, not to mention life-saving assistance in times of emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has long passed for flight attendants to be denied the same protections that the Federal Government affords millions of other hard-working employees in both the  private and public sector, including its own employees. It is time for Congress to extend OSHA protections to 50,000 American workers who have been denied this basic employment right by their federal regulator, the FAA, which should be leading this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important provision that will bring fundamental fairness to the industry is the bill's abolition of the arbitrary 60-year age limit on commercial pilots. Only commercial airline pilots in the U.S. are prohibited from flying after age 60. The International Civil Aviation Authority already allows its pilots to fly to age 65. Many advanced countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand have no age limit. Only the U.S., Pakistan, France and Colombia still hold on to this arbitrary  disqualification of otherwise competent pilots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While eliminating this totally subjective and discriminatory restriction on the right to work, the bill provides the necessary safeguards to protect the flying public. No pilot over the age of 60 who is not otherwise capable and qualified will be able to work on the flight deck, just like any other qualified pilot of any age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA itself agrees that the 60-year old limit should be abolished, but it will take the agency two years to promulgate regulations to change this admittedly archaic rule. Meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 pilots will needlessly be forced to retire unless we pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, one of the more contentious provisions of the bill relates to collective bargaining for air traffic controllers. I support the air traffic controllers on this issue. It is a matter of simple fairness that the FAA be compelled to deal fairly with this important group of its employees. There is no fair and equal collective bargaining if one side can walk away from the negotiation table and unilaterally impose its position once an impasse is reached. Fundamental fairness requires that the  parties resume negotiations until an agreement is reached and, if the parties cannot agree, mediation should be required. Meanwhile, the pre-impasse terms and conditions of employment should be maintained, as it is in all collective bargaining relationships, until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collective bargaining not only protects the rights and benefits of the air traffic controllers, but also protects the lives and safety of the traveling public. When they are adequately compensated and allowed sufficient time for training, rest and recuperation, air traffic controllers would able to do their jobs more effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no worse a method to destroy morale and loyalty--and hence effectiveness and performance--of employees than to show such disrespect for them. In a job as critical to the safety of millions of travelers, the effectiveness and professionalism of air traffic controllers must be fostered, not undermined by unfair employment practices that treat them with such undeserved disdain. Giving these important employees bargaining rights equal to the employer is not only the right thing to do, it  is the safe thing to do for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the reasons I have stated, I support this comprehensive and major improvement to our nation's aviation system. I urge my colleagues to look at the bill in its entirety and vote to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, aviation is a growing industry in the 6th Congressional District of North Carolina, and therefore my interest in the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration stems from both a consumer and industry perspective. I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some provisions in <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> which are beneficial to my area and others which cause concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a vibrant general aviation community within North Carolina, and many of the airports in my district are dependent upon the Airport Improvement Program to fund necessary infrastructure improvements. I am pleased that this legislation builds upon this successful program. It is my hope that as the bill moves forward, we will continue to seek ways to augment, and even create incentives, within the AlP program because it is a vital tool for economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I remain supportive of the Small Community Air Services Development Program which is reauthorized in <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>. I have seen first-hand the success this program has had in my district, and believe that it is another tool which encourages community development, particularly in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also pleased that the bill before us takes the initial steps to modernize and update our air traffic control system. While I don't pretend to understand the technology, I do believe that upgrading our current air traffic control system will create more efficient and effective management of our airways. I'm hopeful that this investment, coupled with improving infrastructure, will help to alleviate much of the delays and cancellations that each of us currently face all too often when we go  to the airport. We still have much work to do, but I believe this bill is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also areas in the base bill which concern me. I have nothing but the utmost respect for the air traffic controllers of this Nation, and especially those that live and work within my district. I have had frank and constructive conversations on a variety of issues with them in the past several months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite that, I still have reservations about the intent and ramifications of the language in the base bill which would reopen the recently implemented contract. First and foremost, the issue of back pay concerns me from a fiscal and fairness perspective. Regardless of whether you support or oppose the current contract, to simply invalidate the contract, in my opinion, undermines the bargaining process. Further, I remain concerned at the effect this amendment will have on our Nation's taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I remain concerned by language in the bill which would require non-pilot employees to be covered under the National Labor Relations Act. This language, which is directed at one express shipping company, in my opinion could undermine the national transportation network and create many unintended consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this bill moves forward, I hope that we can continue to work towards modernizing our air traffic control system and also resolve issues where there is disagreement. Because of the concerns outlined above, I intend to oppose the base bill, but do so recognizing that there are provisions which I support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> and urge its approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The version of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> that is before us today is the product of a constructive, bipartisan collaboration between the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Science and Technology Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my appreciation for the fine work done by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members and staff, and in particular Chairman Jim Oberstar and Ranking Member John Mica, along with the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee (and senior member of the Science and Technology Committee), Jerry Costello, and Ranking Minority member Tom Petri. I appreciate the cooperative efforts that made this merged bill possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman Bart Gordon, Ranking Member Ralph Hall, and my good friend and Ranking Member on the space and aeronautics subcommittee, Representative Tom Feeney, for all of their hard work on <bill type="h" number="2698">H.R. 2698</bill>, the Federal Aviation R&amp;D Reauthorization Act of 2007--which was unanimously passed by the Science and Technology Committee earlier this year and which has now been incorporated into the bill we are considering today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Science and Technology Committee majority and minority staff has done great work on this bill and I would like to thank them  as well, especially Richard Obermann, Ed Feddeman, Tim Athan, and John Piazza for their hard work. I am pleased that <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> will reauthorize a range of important R&amp;D activities at the FAA--including R&amp;D related to aviation noise and emissions reduction--establish new R&amp;D initiatives in some key areas, and include provisions  aimed at strengthening the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative and the interagency Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), which has the responsibility for planning and developing NextGen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of my limited time, I would like to highlight just two of the new initiatives in the bill that I think are especially important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill establishes an interagency research program to better understand the impact of aviation on climate change. This is a serious matter, with both economic and quality-of-life implications, and thus I believe that this research effort is critically important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill establishes a multi-agency research program to conduct research on the impacts of space weather on aviation and air passengers. This is motivated by the increased importance of space weather to aviation, especially with the increased incidence of flight operations over the polar regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while I could spend all my time discussing the important provisions from <bill type="h" number="2698">H.R. 2698</bill> that have been included in <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, I would be remiss if I did not discuss several other features of the bill that I think are important.  It is clear, I think, that enhancing the Nation's aviation needs while addressing unique challenges of individual communities is not an easy task. I believe that this bill moves our Nation's air transportation system forward while being understanding of the obstacles  that face each state and locality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, the Department of Transportation (DOT) reported that only 72.5 percent of domestic flights by the largest U.S. airlines arrived on-time from January to April of this year.  This is the worst showing since DOT began reporting on-time performance in 1995.  Robust investment in aviation infrastructure is crucial to increase air capacity and decrease fight delays. I am pleased that this bill provides for increased funding for a number of FAA capital programs, including the Airport Improvement  Program (AIP).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this legislation is vital to the health of the Nation's air transportation system and the continued economic vitality of Colorado.  I am especially pleased that the bill designates a program within FAA to improve safety and efficiency of radar coverage in mountainous areas.  While the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the FAA have already begun such an endeavor, this bill will further cement and provide funding for enhanced radar coverage at mountain airports in Colorado  and elsewhere.  Not only will this program increase safety but it will also provide multi-modal benefits by reducing congestion on highways due to flight diversions or denied service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is no exaggeration to say that the Nation's air transportation system is critical to our economic well-being, our international competitiveness, and our quality of life. I believe that <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> will help maintain its continued vitality and safety, and I urge Members to support the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400630" topic="OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this very important legislation reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also rise to commend Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as well as Chairman Costello and Ranking Member Petri of the Subcommittee on Aviation for their excellent leadership on this bill and for their continued dedicated service on transportation issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains a number of critical provisions that will improve our nation's transportation system. In particular, this legislation will go a long way towards modernizing and improving our nation's air traffic control capabilities by providing $13 billion to accelerate the implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation system. Through modernization and increased use of technology, this system will enable our air traffic control system to meet two to three times the amount of current  demand, allowing us to keep pace with the ever-increasing number of flights. This technology will also allow us to more accurately track flights, preventing collisions in our increasingly congested skies. In addition, the FAA will be given the resources to make necessary improvements and replacements of facilities and equipment, ensuring the highest degree of air traffic support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for including report language on the potential application of Qualification Based Selection for Passenger Facility Charge funded airport projects. Qualification Based Selection is a process that works well with Airport Improvement Program funded projects and some other federally-funded transportation projects. It has been a process that has saved time and saved money in other transportation projects.  Consequently, taking a closer and more comprehensive look to see how it could be effectively implemented with PFC-funded projects seems to be a logical step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization also takes some important steps towards protecting flight crews and passengers. For example, OSHA requirements are finally extended to aircraft crewmembers under this bill, helping to ensure their on-the-job safety. This legislation also directs the FAA to conduct a study on pilot fatigue, and based on the findings of that study, update their regulations regarding flight time limitations and rest requirements for pilots. Furthermore, airlines and airports will be required  to have contingency plans in place to take care of passengers affected by long delays, including providing food, water and medical care. This provision is a welcome relief to all of us who have ever experienced long and painful flight delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this reauthorization includes $570 million to increase the number of aviation safety inspectors by more than one-third. These inspectors develop, administer, and enforce safety requirements for all aircraft being developed and flying today. Increasing the number of these inspectors will help ensure that our skies are as safe as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this reauthorization includes a number of provisions that will improve our environment. It directs the FAA to work to develop lower energy, emissions and noise engine and airframe technology. This type of technology will help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, improve our air quality, and combat climate change. This bill also contains measures to improve the environments of airport lands, including addressing water and air quality issues, and reduce aircraft idling  time to reduce emissions and fuel consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these environmental provisions, I would also like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica of the full Committee and Chairman Costello and Ranking Member Petri of the Aviation Subcommittee for working with me to include two provisions increasing R&amp;D for environmental improvements related to aircraft fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, general aviation piston aircraft operate on 100 Octane leaded aviation gasoline, or avgas, which contains four times the amount of lead found in the already-banned leaded automotive fuel and is extremely toxic. Unfortunately, no economical alternative currently exists. Environmental and health concerns over this leaded gasoline will only continue to grow as use of these planes increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to address this issue, I worked to include in this bill a provision to continue and enhance R&amp;D for alternative aviation fuels. This provision, which authorizes $750,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2010, will help to expedite the development, testing, and approval of an economical, unleaded alternative aircraft fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also included in this reauthorization is a provision I authored for a new FAA Center of Excellence focused on alternative jet fuel research. FAA Air Transportation Centers of Excellence provide research on important transportation issues through partnerships between the FAA, universities, industry and state and local government. In conducting transportation research, Centers of Excellence also prepare a new generation of trained professionals ready to meet our nation's transportation needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in the coming years, perhaps no transportation need will be greater than the need for alternative energies. Increasing demand for fossil fuels and continued volatility in many energy supplying nations means that the price of fossil fuels will continue to go up. And, increased emissions from the use of fossil fuels further endanger our global environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jet fuel in particular illustrates the dangers of our current reliance on fossil fuels. Many airlines in this country, already fighting bankruptcy, are particularly vulnerable to higher fuel prices and increased volatility in the energy market. And while jet emissions still constitute only 3% of global emissions, that share is growing rapidly as the number of flights worldwide continues to increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consequently, it is apparent that developing alternative jet fuels is imperative for our Nation's airlines and our environment. Recognizing this need, and witnessing the valuable R&amp;D that FAA Centers of Excellence have provided in other areas such as Airliner Cabin Environment, Noise and Emissions, and Airport Technology, I authored a provision included in this reauthorization which will create an FAA Center of Excellence dedicated to alternative jet fuel research. This Center of Excellence's  research will improve the long-term health of our domestic aviation economy and our global environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits of this Center of Excellence and all the improvements in safety, efficiency, labor protections and environment provided by  this reauthorization are particularly important to my hometown of Chicago. Chicago is the transportation hub of the Nation and transportation is--metaphorically and literally--what keeps our region moving. Chicago Midway Airport, which is in my District, and nearby O'Hare International Airport, are two of the busiest  and largest airports in the Nation. And while thousands of people pass through these airports every day, they are the local airports for my constituents and the surrounding communities. Consequently, any national improvements in our aviation system will be acutely felt by those</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And importantly for my District, this FAA reauthorization provides necessary funding to make our runways safer. This issue is important to the many people in Chicagoland who still clearly remember the tragic accident in 2005 when an aircraft skidded off the runway at Midway Airport and into a passing car, killing a young boy. To address some of the concerns raised by these types of accidents, this legislation provides $42 million over four years for runway incursion reduction programs and $74  million over four years for runway status light acquisition and installation. These runway improvements will not only help to protect flight crews and aircraft passengers, but also the people such as those in my district who live and work alongside our Nation's airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, this FAA reauthorization contains important efficiency, safety and environmental provisions that will benefit the Nation and Chicagoland in particular, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to strongly oppose a provision that was included in <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill contains language that would unfairly target a single company located in my Sate and compel them to change the way they do business. There have been no hearings on this issue and I am concerned that there could be considerable unintended consequences if this provision is approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inclusion of the language could also put this critical aviation safety bill at risk. I have been told that several Senators have made clear this provision is a non-starter that puts a speedy and successful Conference at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time where air traffic is in gridlock, I think we have a duty to the American public to pass a bill that can quickly be conferenced with the Senate. Because I do think that we need to move forward on FAA reform, I will reluctantly vote for <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>. However, I believe that this bill is far too important to be used as a vehicle for targeting a single American company and am hopeful that this issue will be addressed in conference.</paragraph>

  <chair>SEC. 201. MISSION STATEMENT; SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The United States faces a great national challenge as the Nation's aviation infrastructure is at a crossroads.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The demand for aviation services, a critical element of the United States economy, vital in supporting the quality of life of the people of the United States, and critical in support of the Nation's defense and national security, is growing at an ever increasing rate. At the same time, the ability of the United States air transportation system to expand and change to meet this increasing demand is limited.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The aviation industry accounts for more than 10,000,000 jobs in the United States and contributes approximately $900,000,000,000 annually to the United States gross domestic product.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The United States air transportation system continues to drive economic growth in the United States and will continue to be a major economic driver as air traffic triples over the next 20 years.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The Next Generation Air Transportation System (in this section referred to as the "NextGen System") is the system for achieving long-term transformation of the United States air transportation system that focuses on developing and implementing new technologies and that will set the stage for the long-term development of a scalable and more flexible air transportation system without compromising the unprecedented safety record of United States aviation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) The benefits of the NextGen System, in terms of promoting economic growth and development, are enormous.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The NextGen System will guide the path of the United States air transportation system in the challenging years ahead.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) modernizing the air transportation system is a national priority and the United States must make a commitment to revitalizing this essential component of the Nation's transportation infrastructure;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) one fundamental requirement for the success of the NextGen System is strong leadership and sufficient resources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the Joint Planning and Development Office of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Next Generation Air Transportation System Senior Policy Committee, each established by Congress in 2003, will lead and facilitate this important national mission to ensure that the programs and capabilities of the NextGen System are carefully integrated and aligned;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Government agencies and industry must work together, carefully integrating and aligning their work to meet the needs of the NextGen System in the development of budgets, programs, planning, and research;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must work in cooperation and make transformational improvements to the United States air transportation infrastructure a priority; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) due to the critical importance of the NextGen System to the economic and national security of the United States, partner departments and agencies must be provided with the resources required to complete the implementation of the NextGen System.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 202.

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Airline delays, as I said at the outset of general debate, have reached historic levels, 72 percent of flights arriving on time so far this year. Long term, we need continued modernization of the aircraft traffic control system. That is not to say that this is a system that has been frozen in time and nothing has been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA has, over the past 20-plus years, 25 years, installed over 80,000 pieces of technology to upgrade, modernize, expand, and increase capacity in the air traffic control system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They installed a voice switching and control system over one weekend, with a million lines of computer code, installing this entirely new communication system over one weekend without a second of delay in the air traffic control operations. That's like changing a tire on a car moving at 60 miles an hour. They did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They installed the automatic replacement system for the en route centers, and did that after 5 years of development of this greatly enhanced new technology, increasing to 1,300,000 lines of computer code. And the installment is now working well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System, the STARS, that, too, took years to develop; 1,300,000 lines of computer code also installed and operating effectively. But those were platforms on which we build the air traffic control technology of the future. And in this legislation, we provide for the funding of the air traffic control technology of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield now to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Oberstar for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the manager's amendment. The amendment includes a variety of provisions important to the future of aviation. And I will quickly just highlight a few provisions in the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is, we make a variety of improvements to the Essential Air Service program which supports over 100 communities in 35 States. The amendment includes language to provide that all future integrations of labor seniority lists will be completed in a fair and equitable manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress that represents the St. Louis area, what I went through with the TWA and American Airlines merger was very difficult for many employees, and we want to prevent that hardship from occurring in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also include an update of our aircraft rescue and firefighting standards. The current FAA standards have not been updated since 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, I need to highlight the fact that the manager's amendment does strengthen the consumer protection part of the bill and creates a Passenger Bill of Rights. It requires large air carriers, large hubs and medium hubs to follow emergency contingency plans, detailing food, water, restroom facilities, cabin ventilation, and medical treatment for passengers onboard aircraft with the Secretary of Transportation. The plan must also be updated periodically. And fines are imposed by the Department  of Transportation for violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment strengthens these provisions in many ways. First, it specifies that the water provided must meet the Safe Drinking Water Act standard. Secondly, carriers in airports must detail how they will allow passengers to deplane following excessive delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the manager's amendment explicitly states that DOT can assess civil penalties against air carriers or airports that fail to adhere to these approved contingency plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, aircraft and airports are required to submit these plans and ensure public access to these documents. And, also, the FAA would be required to install an 800 number for consumers to use as a hotline to report problems that they are encountering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the provision updates overbooking compensation and requires the formation of an advisory committee for aviation consumer protection to provide recommendations to the Secretary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Chairman, as you can see, these improvements are all important to our policy that improve the safety of our aviation system and expand the availability of service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Oberstar manager's amendment, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>We'll call it the Oberstar-Costello manager's amendment, which will serve to reduce  delays, increase passenger rights, enhance small community air service, and improve oversight of safety maintenance of aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400318" topic="">
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I can't support this amendment. While we have reached bipartisan agreements on many of the provisions, there are several that impose new burdens, new regulations and potentially high and crippling costs. For example, notifying a passenger when buying a ticket whether an insecticide has been used on the plane in the last 60 days before the flight is a procedural nightmare for airlines. Is it really a national problem that requires such onerous regulation? How many flights  would that plane have taken and in what countries? It's just incredible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, many provisions are worthy, but I cannot support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield such time as he may consume to our ranking member, Mr. Mica.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member, Mr. Petri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I have to rise, also, in opposition to the manager's amendment. I did cite that the poison pill that was added after introduction of the bill was, of course, the reach-back for Big Labor, which has a $1.9 billion price tag over 5 years. We've had problems with the FedEx provision, which unfairly targets that company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agreed to raise some fees, but then in the main bill we would divert some funds to bicycle storage. We open up multi-billion dollar funding for purposes like that that are hard to explain to people who want airports expanded and improvements and get something else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have some 40-now studies as a result of the manager's amendment, I think we're up to at least 40, and $25 million costs, not to mention additional earmarks for union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The OSHA provision for regulation on airplanes added in this, I think it's important that we have safe cabins for passengers, but again, we can have a nightmare in imposing OSHA regulations where they're very difficult to enforce and create, again, a nightmare not only for enforcement, but for those who work on the aircraft and for those who are involved in commercial aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighting standards are important, but to impose them, and we tried to get some more reasonable standards, but to impose them arbitrarily at huge expense for small and medium airports that don't have the traffic that warrant some of these mandates from the Federal level, diversion of additional funds. We want our foreign repair stations to have the best certified mechanics; but when you put a provision in, that is contrary to international treaties and agreements. So the list goes on and on.  I guess ranking member, Mr. Petri, said the bug control notification is sort of the icing on the cake of why we can't support the manager's amendment. Just some well-intended provisions, but misguided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We certainly will work with the other side. We tried up until the introduction, and we will continue honest efforts to take their good intentions and put it into good legislation rather than a maze of costs, mandates, and burdens that don't get us where we need to be.</paragraph>

  <chair> Page 96, line 25, before the first period, insert ", and (2) modify the certification requirements under such part to include testing for the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in accordance with section 45102 of any individual performing a safety-sensitive function at a foreign aircraft repair station, including an individual working at a station of a third-party with whom an air carrier contracts to perform work on air carrier aircraft or components".&lt;p&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, aircraft repair stations located in foreign countries are allowed to become certified by the Federal Aviation Administration to work on United States aircraft without meeting the same standards or being subject to the same oversight imposed on domestic stations in regard to drug and alcohol testing of workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would close this loophole because it makes no sense to require U.S. mechanics to undergo various levels of drug and alcohol testing if workers doing the same work on the same type of aircraft for the part of the same airlines are exempt from this requirement simply because the station is located overseas in another country. According to a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation, the number of certified foreign repair stations has increased from 344 in  1994 to almost 700 in 2007, more than double the number of stations over the last 13 years. U.S. air carriers now outsource overseas 35 percent of their maintenance work to foreign repair stations, and that is up 21 percent from 2003. This growing trend necessitates the additional safety standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA itself has moved to extend drug and alcohol testing domestically and noted, "It has the statutory authority and, in the interest of aviation safety, the responsibility to require that individuals who actually perform safety-sensitive duties are subject to drug and alcohol testing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the Department of Transportation's recent pilot program to allow Mexican-domiciled motor carriers to enter and travel throughout the United States, DOT stipulated that operating authority will not be granted to these Mexican companies unless this company has in place, and DOT can verify, a controlled substance and alcohol testing program consistent with U.S. domestic requirements. So if DOT can impose the requirements on Mexican drivers as a condition of entering the U.S. in the name of  safety, there is no reason why the FAA cannot follow suit with similar requirements for foreign mechanics working on aircraft that will operate in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a safety issue. Mechanics that work on American aircraft overseas should meet the same drug testing requirements as mechanics that work on these aircraft in the borders of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support of this amendment to close this loophole so that all maintenance workers who work on planes that fly in the United States equally are treated the same and undergo drug and alcohol testing.</paragraph>

  <chair> Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall conduct a study and submit a report to Congress regarding effective strategies to alleviate congestion in the national airspace at airports during peak travel times, by evaluating the effectiveness of reducing flight schedules and staggering flights, developing incentives for airlines to reduce the number of flights offered, and instituting slots and quotas at airports. In addition, the Comptroller  General shall compare the efficiency of implementing the strategies in the preceding sentence with redesigning airspace and evaluate any legal obstacles to implementing such strategies.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman and I thank the Rules Committee for allowing this to be put in order and the Transportation Committee chairman for agreeing to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA is currently implementing a plan known as the Integrated Airspace Alternative to redesign the Northeast airspace to improve congestion at the busiest airports in the Northeast. The FAA only has to consider safety and efficiency when making their decisions. But they do not have to consider the effect of air traffic on the quality of life in the communities near the airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Garrett and I are offering an amendment today to require the Government Accountability Office to issue a report assessing the possibility of utilizing market-based strategies for air congestion reduction. These strategies could include incentivizing airlines to move flights to offpeak times and implementing slot systems for airports or quotas. The report would also have the GAO compare these strategies' effectiveness against redesigned air space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I just say this amendment does not hold up the redesign process. It simply requires a study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I don't know if Mr. Garrett is here. If not, I yield 1 minute to my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400142" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding and for his work and for my colleague SCOTT GARRETT's work in keeping the issue of increased airline noise before the public. Throughout my tenure in the House, I have been an advocate for reducing aircraft noise over northern New Jersey. I have attended dozens of public hearings, had meetings with officials from the FAA and responded to literally thousands of my constituents who are angry  about aircraft noise. This new plan, in fact, increases aircraft noise over northern New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been a strong proponent of the redesign for airspace over New York and New Jersey. The first such design was conducted by the FAA, and through the appropriations process, I think we got $60 million for it. But in the process, the FAA has not adequately addressed the issue of aircraft noise. While this amendment doesn't deal directly with that, I am hopeful that this committee and other Members of Congress will push the FAA to  concentrate on the  issue of aircraft noise, because as we are concentrating on airline safety, we need to remember that people have to live in the area.</paragraph>

We have a serious problem with congestion and delays in our aviation system. We must look at all options for reducing these incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shays' amendment allows the GAO to review a variety of options so that we, as policy makers, can be informed and make responsible decisions towards improving the congestion and delay problem.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am proud to offer this amendment with my colleague from Connecticut. The FAA recently released their Record of Decision regarding the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia Airspace Redesign and it simply fails to achieve a livable balance for tens of thousands of citizens living in north Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State goal of the redesign was to reduce delays and airspace congestion: the FAA met this goal by flying planes over communities that up till now have not had to deal with the noise and pollution generated by overhead air routes. The FAA's study failed to look into any strategies other than airspace redesign to reduce delays and congestion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment will ask the GAO to evaluate how other strategies could reduce delay. I have asked the FAA to review alternative strategies and politely been rebuffed. Perhaps when we compare the results of this study with the FAA's claims perhaps we can have a clear view of whether rerouting planes over our communities is really called for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Record of Decision has been issued, the plans contained in it will be implemented over a course of years. I am hopeful that this will give the FAA time to reconsider and to reconstruct their plans to accommodate the concerns of citizens below the flight paths.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I stand today in strong support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been the worst year on record for air traffic delays. The New York area, which I represent, has three major airports with some of the worst delays in the Nation. Obviously, this situation must change. This amendment would commission a study to determine how best to fix these delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA had a chance to commission such a study, but instead they decided to take a unilateral, misguided approach to redesign the airspace over thousands of residents in my congressional district. The FAA did this without consulting the very people whose lives would be most affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A study should have been conducted years ago. I support reducing delays, but we should first know if the FAA's actions will improve air travel. It would be a mistake for the FAA to continue on this course without knowing whether the airspace redesign would even reduce delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because today we are affected, tomorrow you could be.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is a simple clarification of the language in Section 807. This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a working group to review FAA proposals to consolidate FAA facilities and services and make recommendations to Congress. This working group will include individuals who represent FAA employees, air carriers, general aviation, and the airport community. The FAA may not realign or consolidate FAA facilities and services until Congress has had an opportunity  to consider the working group's recommendations as well as public comments. The purpose of this section is to ensure that FAA consolidation cannot take place without the input of affected stakeholders, the public and Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from California, Representative Waters has concerns about the FAA's consolidation of FAA regional offices. The FAA has nine regional offices serving airports in all 50 States. One of these offices, the Western-Pacific Regional Office, is located in Hawthorne, California, in MAXINE WATERS' congressional district. My home State of Florida is served by the Southern Regional Office, which is located in Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the FAA consolidated administrative and technical support services in the regional offices. The previous year, the FAA consolidated financial accounting services in these offices. The FAA did not seek or accept input from Congress, regional office employees, or the affected communities prior to consolidating these services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has come to our attention that the FAA is currently considering plans to consolidate the engineering services in the regional offices. However, no public comment has been requested by the FAA, despite the fact that engineering services are critical for the safe operation of air traffic control towers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would clarify that Section 807 applies not only to the consolidation of FAA field offices and air traffic control facilities, but also to the consolidation of FAA regional offices and the services they perform. This amendment would ensure that proposals to consolidate the FAA's regional offices will be subject to the same open and transparent process as proposals to consolidate other FAA offices and facilities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me and appreciate his hard work in the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will better ensure the safety of our Nation's citizens, both in the air and on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district last November, in a situation that is unfortunately still far too common, a drunk driving accident resulted in the deaths of a mother, a father and three children. Left behind in Las Vegas, New Mexico, is one sole-surviving child. The family of six was on their way home from a soccer match when their minivan was struck by a drunk driver speeding down the wrong side of the interstate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the investigation unfolded, we learned that only a few hours earlier, the drunk driver was already visibly intoxicated on an airline flight to New Mexico. While other passengers noticed that the man appeared to be intoxicated, he was served more alcohol on board the flight. Just 2 hours after deplaning with a blood alcohol content four times the legal limit, the man took to the highway, killing this family and himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of this horrible tragedy, I learned that Federal regulations prohibit an intoxicated person both from boarding a plane, as well as drinking during a flight. However, the airlines are not required to train their flight attendants on how to identify intoxicated passengers. In order to help prevent a problem from occurring, those in charge must first be able to identify the warning signs. Adequate training to identify and deal with intoxicated passengers is critical to ensuring  attendants make informed decisions when serving alcohol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment works to ensure airline personnel receive this training. It requires airline carriers to provide gate and flight attendants with alcohol-server training to help them recognize intoxicated persons. As New Mexico's Attorney General, I helped implement this training in the service industry, because research shows this knowledge is critical to combating the problem. Training would occur annually and would also provide situational training on how to handle inebriated individuals who are  belligerent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intention of my amendment is to prevent drunk driving, but it does much more. While inebriated passengers pose a danger once they deplane and drive, they also pose a danger during flight. It is no secret that when too much alcohol is involved, tempers are more likely to flare, individuals are more likely to behave inappropriately, and decision-making skills are drastically impaired. For all of these reactions to alcohol, flight attendants must have training on how to handle those people.  It is a commonsense approach for the safety of all people in flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, my amendment cannot prohibit all tragic drunk driving accidents from occurring, but it will implement a system to make it more difficult for passengers over the legal limit from boarding planes, deplaning and driving home. Training to identify intoxicated passengers is critical to ensuring that the attendants make informed decisions when allowing people to board a flight and when deciding whether to serve them alcohol.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because it is both unnecessary and redundant. From June 2004 to June 2006, the FAA established an aviation rulemaking advisory committee consisting of government, industry and labor unions in order to update the current training requirements. The proposed rewrite of Federal regulations will address, among other things, the area of alcohol awareness training for flight and gate attendants. The FAA plans to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in The Federal  Register before the end of calendar year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA's current training requirements address the very issue of handling unruly and intoxicated passengers, both in the air and on the ground. This rulemaking will further strengthen FAA's already adequate training programs to a level that I am sure will meet the gentleman's expectations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Udall amendment is premature. We should let the agency with the most expertise take the lead to do the best job of dealing with the problem which we all agree needs to be even better dealt with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would urge a "no" vote on the Udall amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, having no other requests for time, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we must see that flight attendants are trained in a way that allows us to ensure the safety of those people in their care, our Nation's fliers. But this amendment can do much more. It may also help to ensure the safety of those who were nowhere near the airplane. My amendment cannot prevent every tragedy that comes from alcohol abuse, but it is one more valuable step we can take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to note that my amendment has the support of the Association of Flight Attendants and Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and I would like to include for the Record letters from them of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Irving, TX, September 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN UDALL: I write in support of your amendment to <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your amendment seeks to address a potentially serious problem taking place in our skies. On more than one occasion I have read about an airline passenger who has had too much to drink and then driven after the flight. The Udall amendment seeks to provide proper training to flight attendants with regard to serving alcohol as well as how to address passengers who have had too much to drink. For this reason, MADD supports your amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the latest NHTSA study, in 2006 more than 13,000 people died in alcohol related crashes with a blood alcohol content of .08 or greater. Drunk driving continues to be the leading cause of traffic fatalities in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may be interested to know that in 2006, MADD launched the campaign to eliminate drunk driving. The campaign consists of four points:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intensive high-visibility law enforcement, including twice-yearly crackdowns and frequent enforcement efforts that include sobriety checkpoints and saturation patrols in all 50 states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Full implementation of current alcohol ignition interlock technologies, including efforts to require alcohol ignition interlock devices for all convicted drunk drivers. A key part of this effort is working with judges, prosecutors and state driver's license officials to stop the revolving door of repeat offenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exploration and development of advanced vehicle-based technology that will detect if a driver has an illegal alcohol level of .08 BAC or above and prevent that driver from operating the vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mobilization of grassroots efforts, led by over 400 MADD affiliates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, thank you for your efforts to address excessive drinking on airline flights and best wishes as you pursue your amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Best wishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glynn Birch,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Give Flight Attendants the Know How To Detect Intoxicated Flyers and Increase Flight Safety--Support the Udall Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR COLLEAGUE: Today, I am offering an amendment to the FAA Reauthorization that works to improve the safety of our nation's travelers, both on and off the ground, by requiring airlines to provide alcohol server training for their flight and gate attendants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, federal regulations prohibit an intoxicated person from being served alcohol on board a flight, or even from boarding a flight. However, airlines are not required to train their flight attendants and gate staff on how to identify those that are intoxicated. My simple, straightforward amendment ensures airline personnel receive this essential training. It requires air carriers to provide alcohol server training to gate and flight attendants. This training, which will have to occur annually,  would also include ways to identify intoxicated passengers and deal with disruptive passengers. The Secretary of Transportation will have 180 days to promulgate rules to require this training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Training to identify intoxicated passengers is critical to ensuring that airline employees make informed decisions when allowing people to board a flight, when deciding whether to serve them alcohol, and when necessary, providing them with the tools they need to handle intoxicated and belligerent passengers. It is my hope you will join me in supporting this important amendment, which will help improve public safety both in the air and on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more information on this amendment please contact Noelle Dominguez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE UDALL: On behalf of the 50,000 members of the Association of Flight Attendants--CWA, AFL-CIO (AFA-CWA), I am writing to express support for your amendment to <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> requiring air carriers to provide training to Flight Attendants and Gate Attendants regarding serving alcohol, dealing with disruptive passengers and recognizing intoxicated persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AFA-CWA is especially encouraged by your amendment language calling for training on how to handle intoxicated persons who become belligerent. Congress must finally address the need to provide adequate training for flight attendants who face belligerent and hostile passengers and your amendment is a much needed and appropriate step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AFA-CWA calls on Congress to adopt this vital amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair>Amendment No. 7 offered by Mr. Klein of Florida:</chair>
  <chair> At the end of title IV of the amendment, insert the following (and conform the table of contents of the amendment accordingly):&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 412. EXPANSION OF DOT AIRLINE CONSUMER COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of Transportation shall investigate consumer complaints regarding--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) flight cancellations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) compliance with Federal regulations concerning overbooking seats flights;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) lost, damaged, or delayed baggage, and difficulties with related airline claims procedures;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) problems in obtaining refunds for unused or lost tickets or fare adjustments;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) incorrect or incomplete information about fares, discount fare conditions and availability, overcharges, and fare increases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) the rights of passengers who hold frequent flier miles or equivalent redeemable awards earned through customer-loyalty programs; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) deceptive or misleading advertising.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would first like to start by commending Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairman Costello for their leadership in crafting this ambitious bill and taking some of the complex and critical challenges facing our aviation system to a successful conclusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, air travel in our country, unfortunately, has deteriorated in many ways to an alarming and unacceptable state over the past couple of years. According to a recent Reuters article in July, it confirmed that the 20 largest airlines are on pace for their worst year ever in delays, cancellations and congestion. Now, outgoing FAA Administrator Marion Blakey has warned that airport delays are likely to become worse, a distressing admonition from one of the country's foremost authorities  on air travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, there is plenty of blame to go around. An aging infrastructure, outdated technology, unrealistic flight schedules, an overstretched workforce, along with poor weather, computer glitches, and inadequate space in between planes, have all been cited as contributing to the problems with air travel. With so many deficiencies stressing the system, it is no surprise that we have reached this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also no surprise that the American people are frustrated. We have all heard from our constituents, demanding that we do something with the inexcusable treatment they have received during their air travels. I have heard from one constituent who sat on the tarmac for 3 hours before her flight was cancelled and wasn't able to board another flight until the next day. I think we have all heard those examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another constituent told me that his flight was canceled; and instead of rebooking, the airline made him fly standby. He had to wait 36 more hours before he finally got back. Still another had her bags missing for over 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this treatment is unacceptable. The American people deserve better, whether they are traveling for business or leisure. They have paid their hard-earned money to fly on a plane, and they deserve to be treated with a certain level of respect. If they are not receiving that from the airlines, they should be able to turn to someone who can put pressure on the airlines to give them the respect they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is where my amendment comes in. It would require the Department of Transportation to investigate, subject to appropriations, consumer complaints for a broad range of issues, including flight cancellations, overbooking of flights, baggage problems, ticket refund problems, and incorrect or incomplete fare information to help address the growing unrest among air travelers who receive unacceptable consumer service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no intention of reinventing the wheel here, however. The Department of Transportation already operates a division that handles airline consumer complaints, with authority to issue warnings, cease and desist orders and fines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, because of a variety of reasons, including budgetary constraints, the Department has chosen to greatly limit the number of investigations it pursues, focusing mainly on discrimination and disability claims. Other  types of claims are simply logged and reported monthly, giving consumers with legitimate grievances no recourse or explanation for their treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am proposing is a simple expansion of the division so that they have the authority and resources to investigate a wider range of legitimate consumer grievances. I think it is a fair and reasonable response to the overwhelming problems the American people have endured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if my colleagues are still not convinced, I would ask that they listen to the Department of Transportation's own Inspector General. In a report to Congress on April 20, he recommended that the Department "take a more active role in airline customer service issues." This amendment would turn the Inspector General's recommendation into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we stand here today prepared to pass a far-reaching and well-thought-out bill that addresses many of the critical infrastructure and technological shortcomings facing the airlines, airports and the FAA, as well as adding several critical safeguards for airline passengers. My amendment would add another layer of protection for customers that is practical and fair. I urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this provision would gut much of the ongoing high-priority work of the Department of Transportation Aviation Enforcement Office by requiring most of its resources to be dedicated to consumers' complaints.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I certainly agree that consumer complaint oversight is important, the dedication of so many resources to only one issue is just not right. This provision would force the Aviation Enforcement Office to stop other important aviation enforcement, compliance, and consumer information and education activities that have for years been a priority for that office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision would do so by requiring the investigation of each consumer complaint regarding flight cancellations, overbooking, baggage, refunds, fares and related conditions, frequent flier programs and deceptive or misleading advertising.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the only investigations that have been required by Congress are disability-related complaints. Sadly, to comply with this provision, the Aviation Enforcement Office would have to discontinue enforcement and compliance work involving racial, ethnic and sex-based discrimination, compliance with the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act, public charter flight violations, and code sharing disclosure violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compliance with this provision would also necessitate that the office end its enforcement of unrealistic scheduling, contract of carriage violations, other unfair and deceptive practices, air carrier fitness and unlicensed and unauthorized operations, insurance violations, and reporting violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the opinion of the experts at the Department of Transportation, these areas of consumer protection are of great importance because they safeguard the whole pool of consumers by protecting against bad business practice trends, rather than prosecuting case by case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of consumer information and education, some of the most important matters that would have to be eliminated are preparation of the monthly air travel consumer report, updating of aviation consumer guidance material, conducting industry and public forums on disability issues, and participating and providing information of government, industry and consumer conferences. In addition, the Aviation Enforcement Office would have to cease all its rulemaking activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone knows that with tight government budgets, you really cannot investigate every single case at the Federal level. Instead, you provide a forum to file and maintain complaints that are reviewed for patterns of abuse. You then pursue those cases that will do the most good for the largest number of consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this amendment, contrary to the intent of the author, would have disastrous effects on aviation consumer protection and enforcement of the aviation economic regulations that are currently on the books, and, therefore, I urge Members to vote "no" on this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and offering his amendment.

    <paragraph>Let me commend the gentleman for his amendment. There is no question that, as we have heard today, complaints are on the rise. There are a number of problems. This amendment ensures that consumers are getting their concerns addressed through the official process, and we will work to ensure that the proper funding to undertake these responsibilities by the FAA is forthcoming.

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a very straightforward amendment. Two important issues are going on in our country right now. One of those we are talking about on the floor of the House today, and that is Americans' safety in the air, making sure when our American citizens travel across the country they are doing it in a safe way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other issue that is important to the United States Congress and to the American people is energy. One of the things that we know today is wind energy, a renewable source of energy, is  becoming a predominant piece of the solution for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several months ago I convened in Abilene, Texas, at Dyess Air Force Base, members of Department of Defense, Department of Energy, FAA and other agencies talking about how in the future, as we develop more renewable sources, particularly wind energy, how we make sure that there is a compatibility between air safety and providing energy for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we decided was that there needs to be a repository, a place where data is maintained on the effects of certain kinds of wind turbines on radar, where the proper placement is so they can continue to be a vital part of our energy supply, while at the same time making sure the American people are safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment provides for a study to study all of the components that need to go into that database and that repository to make sure that we have all of the bases covered. This is kind of a proactive step. What we are intending to do here, as people are planning these kinds of projects, there is a place where people can go where they can get the information up front rather than in hindsight after that project has moved along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of support for this amendment from the Department of Energy, Department of Defense and other agencies thinking this is the right step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, who has worked tirelessly for transportation issues over a number of years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400318" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to support the gentleman's amendment and say that as we look to the future of wind energy, we need to make certain that the process for siting turbines is appropriate for all stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, we need policies in place to ensure that wind turbines do not interfere with important aviation sites, while giving the wind industry appropriate planning tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Congressman Neugebauer for working with the wind industry and others to refine this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In this situation, these agencies are working together already. They are bringing a commonsense solution to this issue. I think this is a good policy for our country and for the American people as we make sure that they fly safely in the future, and also make sure that they have an appropriate energy supply.</paragraph>
