    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the State Department has notified this House of the President's intent to transfer $86 million to provide vehicles, uniforms and body armor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' security forces. Yet on January 11, Abbas made the following remarks at a Fatah rally in Ramallah: "Let 1,000 flowers bloom and let our rifles, all our rifles, all our rifles, be aimed at the occupation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have seen this movie before. In 1996, the U.S. pledged $100 million to help Fatah defeat Hamas terrorists. But in 2000, Yasser Arafat turned his American-funded security forces on Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Abbas calls on rifles to be aimed at Israel again, and we are poised to give him $86 million to upgrade his security forces, without first establishing an independent audit regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to apply the lessons of history and to increase the effective oversight of this taxpayer-funded program, which in the past has been turned against our allies in Israel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
