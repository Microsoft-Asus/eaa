    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we can all think of instances where some great  calamity was about to happen, and yet we have to stand by powerless to help; like the pilot of the Titanic, he sees the glacier emerging through the midst, he spins the wheel too late. And that is the case this morning, not with a steamship but with SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't take any towering intellect to see the problems. We're going to vote to tax Americans with private health insurance, and we're going to take the benefits away from older Americans, with their Medicare, and we're going to give that money to give free health insurance to children with families making more than $80,000, children of illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of history suggests that socialized medicine is not the way to go, and yet the Democrats are about to vote for something which will make the Titanic wreck look small.</paragraph>
