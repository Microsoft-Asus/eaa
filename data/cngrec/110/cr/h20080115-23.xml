    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a faithful pastor who served a growing and vibrant church for 32 years. Rev. Roger Baker, who is retiring from ministry at Calvary Baptist Church in King, North Carolina, has given his life to ministry in the church and the surrounding community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When my friend Rev. Baker first began pastoring at Calvary Baptist 32 years ago, it was a congregation of about 75. Today, the church has grown to nearly 900 under his astute leadership and pastoral care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Rev. Baker's tenure, the church started a local Christian school, Calvary Christian School; and he also founded a seminary to educate the next generation of church leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As president of Calvary Baptist Bible College, Rev. Baker has helped to equip many for the role of pastoral teaching and care. He will continue to serve as a teaching professor at the seminary after his retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Men like Rev. Baker do not often come along. His faithful witness in the community and sterling Christian testimony have touched countless lives as he strives to spread the good news. This man is not only a great pastor; he is a faithful Christian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Rev. Baker on his 32 years of service and wish him the very best in his kingdom work during retirement. The people of Calvary Baptist have been fortunate to call him their own.</paragraph>
