  <narrative>OIL SHALES -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9569">S9569</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the discussion is on the serious problem this country is facing. While I take a position against the administration's program, I know they are behind closed doors with the leadership on both sides, both Houses, trying to come up with something that is workable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest what we are going to vote on, scheduled for 11:30 a.m., which I think will be a little later than that, does not have a solution. One of the points I want to make sure everyone knows is that in this legislation is the extension of the moratorium on oil shale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2007 established a 1-year moratorium on the necessary funding to complete the final regulations for commercial leasing of oil shale on public lands. Without congressional action, the moratorium will expire. The stimulus bill that we will be voting on shortly after 11:30 will continue this moratorium for another year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is serious. The Senate has debated energy legislation for weeks, and the extension of this moratorium does nothing to address increasing domestic energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The potential energy development from the Rocky Mountain oil shale is truly massive. The Green River Formation located within Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah contains the equivalent of 6 trillion barrels of oil. Of this 6 trillion, the RAND Corporation estimates there are 1.1 trillion recoverable barrels. That equals more than 2,000 years' worth of imports from Saudi Arabia, or 145 years of domestic supply at current rates of oil consumption. These numbers would nearly double assuming the Department  of Energy's estimate of nearly 2 trillion potentially recoverable barrels. What we are talking about is huge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The RAND Corporation projects that within the first 12 years of commercial production, these barrels would be recoverable at prices as low as $35 to $48 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are problems out there. We have been arguing on the floor of the Senate, and the Democrats refuse to increase the supply or vote for any increase in oil or gas in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the Outer Continental Shelf discussion that is going on. This bill doesn't affect that. However, since 1982, Democrats and the environmental left have blocked access to 85 percent of America's Outer Continental Shelf resources. With this year's record-high gas prices, Americans have demanded that the Democrats in Congress allow us to produce from our own resources. With just 6 weeks until election day, Democrats have finally relented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We held a news conference yesterday. We all celebrated the fact that we are going to allow these two moratoria to expire. This bill will stop the expiration of the moratorium on oil shale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Interior Department estimates that the Outer Continental Shelf contains 19 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil. That equals 35 years of imports from Saudi Arabia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can see that while the Outer Continental Shelf is great, we want to remove that moratorium. It is even much more important we do it with oil shale because of the sheer size. As I say, the vote doesn't affect the Outer Continental Shelf, but it does affect oil shale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans spent more than $327 billion to import oil in 2007. These oil imports accounted for 46 percent of the Nation's $711 billion trade deficit last year. By opening the Outer Continental Shelf and the oil shale, America can cut that trade deficit in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assuming a $130 price per barrel of oil, America will trade more than $135 billion to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil imports this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outer Continental Shelf and oil shale production can stop this transfer of oil and keep hundreds of billions of dollars at home within our economy creating jobs at home, not overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is not running out of oil and gas or running out of places to look for oil and gas. America is running out of places where the Democrats in Congress are allowing us to look for oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a great celebration on Wednesday that the moratoria would be lifted in both areas. This bill would extend the moratorium on shale, the largest opportunity we have and potential we have for reserves and for lowering the price of gas at the pump that we will be dealing with this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
