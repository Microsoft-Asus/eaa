  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the Republican Leader, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each and the time controlled between the two leaders or their designees. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of <bill type="s" number="2663">S. 2663</bill>, the bill to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Senate will stand in recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly caucus lunches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to do everything within our power to finish the CPSC bill this week. Everyone should understand that we have to complete the bill this week because next week we have to be on the budget. So I would hope everyone understands that if we finish this bill at a decent hour on Thursday, we will be out Thursday; otherwise, we are going to have to work until we complete it, whatever that takes.</paragraph>
