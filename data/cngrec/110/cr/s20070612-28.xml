    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge a special milestone in the career of one of the truly great nuclear energy luminaries of our time. I am speaking of the retirement of Dr. James A. Lake of Idaho National Laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his nearly quarter-century of service to Idaho National Laboratory--and by extension, to all of America--Dr. Lake has applied his exceptional technical and managerial expertise to some of this Nation's highest priority research and development initiatives in the nuclear energy arena. From leading the design team that developed an innovative ultra-high-flux research reactor concept early in his Idaho career, to guiding the establishment of the U.S./Russian International Centers for Environmental  Safety later on, Dr. Lake's contributions have had an extraordinary impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the elected president of the American Nuclear Society at the start of the 21st century, Dr. Lake did much to usher in the nuclear renaissance now sweeping the globe. In a single year, he personally visited 11 countries, a dozen universities, and more than 20 nuclear powerplants and nuclear facilities around the world. He also gave countless interviews with major television, newspaper, and magazine journalists--representing CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, BusinessWeek and  others--to help them better understand nuclear power's unique abilities to dependably generate massive amounts of electricity--around the clock, rain or shine--without generating any of the greenhouse gases that are now of such global concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his contributions to INL and the American Nuclear Society, Dr. Lake has also left his indelible mark of excellence on countless other organizations and activities ranging from the American Association of Engineering Societies to the International Nuclear Societies Council. He holds patents on "An Inherently Safe Fast Breeder Reactor" and other key nuclear technologies and has more than 35 publications in refereed journals and conference proceedings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. James A. Lake--scientist, research leader, nuclear energy visionary, and gentleman--leaves a legacy of growth, safety, and success in the nuclear programs at INL, for which the laboratory, the great State of Idaho, and the Nation will be forever grateful. I extend my best wishes to Dr. Lake as he retires from INL and moves on to the next chapter of his remarkable life.</paragraph>
