  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is now Wednesday of a week that began with a 504-point collapse in the stock market on Monday. The American economy, I think most people would understand, is in serious trouble. These are not ordinary times for our country. We have been the economic engine of the world. We have built an economic engine that is unparalleled. It has been an unbelievable economy, and created great jobs. Yet we now run into some very significant problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The financial wreckage that has occurred in recent months in this country is almost staggering. Very large investment banks that have been around for a long while are gone. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, venerable old investment firms. Bear Stearns, a 158-year firm, survived the Civil War, the Great Depression, but it could not survive today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has happened? What is causing all this? We understand in the months of this year up to $1 trillion of taxpayers' money has been offered in support--loan guarantees and various things--to try to contain the growing financial difficulty in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to second-guess those who are working day and night trying to figure out how we stem the damage. I don't know the figures. I am not in the engine room to know all of the dials, gauges, and knobs that they are working on to try to figure out how we stem the damage. So I am not going to be critical today of guarantees and takeovers and so on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to say to the American people that they should not worry about their bank account in an insured bank. I don't think anybody should be concerned or run down and try to take their deposits out of their local banks where their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Those are sound, and those deposits are not in jeopardy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in the middle of a financial storm of the type we are experiencing, I think it is reasonable for the American people, when midnight meetings are proposing tens of billions, $30 billion or $85 billion of taxpayers' money to try to shore up institutions and deal with this spreading problem, to ask the question: How on Earth did this happen, and why did it happen?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two reasons, and it is important to talk about them even in the middle of the storm. One is greed, unbelievable greed; and the second is, in my judgment, deliberate neglect. I will talk about each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I want to talk about them is because we have to make sure we understand what has caused this problem in order to fix it and to make sure it doesn't happen again. It is not as if this country hasn't seen banks collapse. We saw banks collapse in the 1930s in the Great Depression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt put together the New Deal and put together very specific, very stringent provisions dealing with banking and the safety and soundness of banks. Not just the safety and soundness in  numbers but the safety and soundness with respect to perception of that safety and soundness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said we learned a lesson in the 1920s, and that lesson is we ought not merge and fuse together inherently risky items such as securities, real estate, insurance, and other things with banking, whose entire existence depends on the perception of safety and soundness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glass-Steagall and other legislative provisions were created that separated traditional banking from the more risky enterprises. That existed for many decades until about 9 years ago when the Financial Modernization Act, as it was inappropriately named and led by Senator Gramm from Texas, was passed by the Congress. I was one of eight Senators to vote against it because it repealed the elements of the Glass-Steagall Act and created the opportunities for large financial holding companies to once  again fuse and merge together banking with inherently risky enterprises of securities, real estate, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know they said: No, no, we are building firewalls. The firewalls, it turns out, are not very thick. We learned a lesson and forgot it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me describe what happened. Once all of this happened, at the root in this country that deals with greed, we had investment banks, mortgage brokers, hedge funds, and mortgage banks, all of them up to their neck in cash, barrels full of cash they were making. Let me describe how they were doing it, and most people will understand this wreckage is not a surprise at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what they were doing in this country: As the housing bubble was building, caused in part by easy money advertised to people who had bad credit, we saw bad loans put out there in what was called then--the new lexicon--subprime lending. Here is what Countrywide, the largest mortgage banker said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't that unbelievable? Countrywide doesn't exist anymore because it was bought by another firm before it went belly up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't just Countrywide. Here is an ad I pulled off the Internet. It was running on television and radio. Millennia Mortgage:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>12 months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will give you the money to make your first 12 months' payments if you call in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may reduce your current monthly payments by 50 percent and allow you no payments for the first 12 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't that unbelievable? That is nothing compared to these kinds of advertisements, and most of us have heard them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zoom Credit, here is what it said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan, or a credit card. Even if your credit's in the tank. Zoom Credit's like money in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who cares?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is this business? No, this is insanity. This is not business. Zoom Credit: Your credit is in the tank, there is money in the bank for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, in addition to putting mortgages out to people who had bad credit, here is what they advertised: You want to get a loan with no documentation so you don't even have to document your income, that is no problem. We will give you a no-doc loan. You don't have to document your loan. We will give you low-doc loan so you do minimum documentation of your income. By the way, you don't have to make any payments the first 12 months, or you can make payments the first 12 months and pay no  principal or you can pay no principal and only partial interest. Unbelievable. All of these companies, shame on them. Unbelievable, unfettered greed making money by the barrel, leaving the rest of us with the financial wreckage that occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what happened. They put out all these bad mortgages, called subprime mortgages. They mixed them with good mortgages and securitized them because these days they securitize everything. They discovered these new exotic financial instruments and put them all together like sawdust and sausage, as they used to do, and put bad loans in with good loans. With all these loans, they put in prepayment penalties saying: We are going to stick you with a reset with a much higher interest rate despite  the fact we did a teaser rate at the front end. And when the higher interest rate happens 3 months from now, you may not be able to pay it, but it doesn't matter. You can flip your property because you will make</paragraph>
    <paragraph>money. Home prices are going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So they put in prepayment penalties, and the prepayment penalties made these little securities seem like this was a sure thing and big money. The broker got the mortgage, got a big bonus, went to the mortgage companies--Countrywide and others. They securitized them and set them up in a hedge fund and moved them around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now they sit with these pieces of security, and they don't have the foggiest idea what is in them. All of a sudden, they go belly up. Mr. President, $1 billion, $10 billion, $100 billion, $1 trillion, and the carnage spreads across this country's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greed, unbelievable greed. This is all about making big money in a manner that defies good business sense, and even more, deliberate neglect by regulators in this town. This is no time for politics, but let me say this. At the start of this administration, regulators came to this town and served notice: It's a business-friendly place. Don't worry, be happy. We don't intend to regulate. One regulator in one agency said: It's a new day here, a new sheriff in town. This is a business-friendly place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the regulators decide they are not going to regulate, it is like taking the cop off the beat. Regulators represent the referee or the cop. I have used the referee analogy--a striped shirt and whistle, and they call the fouls. There have been no fouls here. When you have a mortgage company that says: You have bad credit, you have been bankrupt. You can't pay  your bills? Come to us. The regulator should say: What are you doing? They say: We want to  give you a mortgage that has an unbelievably low rate, 1 1/4  percent and resets at 10 percent and you don't have to document your loan. We will make the first 12 payments for you. Unbelievable, in my judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regulators sat by and watched, and it has cost this country $1 trillion as a result of the unfettered greed that moved across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, Senator McCain recently said the economy is fundamentally sound. It is not. What has happened here is the erosion of economic strength as a result of unbelievable greed with the subprime mortgage that has spread all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, I mentioned that what took away Financial Modernization Act Glass-Steagall and the protections we put in place was Financial Modernization Act, also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. That is Senator Phil Gramm who led the fight here to do that. I didn't vote with him. He is out still advising Senator McCain on the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is not about politics, but it is about what happened, how it happened, why it happened, and what we ought to do to make sure it doesn't happen again. We need effective regulators who decide they are going to do, in the interest of the American taxpayers, what they should do. We ought to go back and plug the loophole that was opened by Senator Gramm and others who said: You know what. Let's forget the lessons of the past. Let's let big holding companies gather up big financial enterprises  and put them into one big sack, and they will run just fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are not running just fine. They are undermining this country's economic strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has used 13 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will say again, as I said when I started, this is no ordinary time. Our economy is in peril. We will recover. I hope the kinds of things that are being done by good people who are working 24 hours a day to try to deal with this wreckage will help our economy recover. We are a very strong country, and we have had some people who have undermined this country's economic strength, but I believe we will overcome it. But we won't overcome it unless we understand what happened,  how it happened, and why it happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say again, as I said yesterday on the floor of the Senate, this is not some mysterious illness for which we don't have a cure. It is pretty obvious what happened, and it is pretty obvious what we have to do to fix it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been on the floor of the Senate talking for some years about this issue, about the unbelievable amount of leverage and the exotic financial instruments. Does anybody out there know that we have some $40 trillion in notional derivative values of credit default swaps? Most people who have them don't even know what they are. Most people didn't understand what kind of infection existed deep in these securitized issues that were being sold back and forth and everybody making money. They had  no idea what was in them that was going to blow up at some point. And it has blown up with a significant force at this point that, so far, has cost the American people, by my calculation, up to $1 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This ought to be an indelible lesson learned for this institution and for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greed must be constrained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The market system is a wonderful system, but you must have a traffic cop on the beat. You must have regulators who regulate. When you begin to take apart things that were protecting this country, such as the Glass-Steagall Act, and promising all kinds of nirvana for tomorrow, when it comes apart, you need to go back and do it over again and do it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I said, these are difficult days, and I want to end as I started. I don't want people who listen to this discussion to believe they should run to the bank and take their deposits out. Insured deposits in American banks are sound, and the American people should understand and not worry about that. That is very important. What we should worry about are the political calculations that led us to take apart the protections, such as Glass-Steagall and others, and second, the unfettered  greed that was going on under the noses of regulators who came to this town in 2001 and who decided they didn't have any interest in regulating anything. Those are lessons we need to learn and learn well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
