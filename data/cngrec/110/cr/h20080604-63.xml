    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans and auto racing enthusiasts around the world look forward to each weekend for the invigorating sights, sounds, and experience of professional sports car racing. These fans owe a great thanks to one of the founding fathers of road racing, Watkins Glen's own Cameron Argetsinger who passed away this last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I join these fans in mourning the loss of this auto racing pioneer who has left an indelible mark on the automobile world and on the community of Watkins Glen, New York. What Cameron Argetsinger began in 1948 as a road race through and over the streets of Watkins Glen, New York, has grown over the last 60 years to now a private track that has hosted the best drivers in the world, from NASCAR to Formula 1, including the United States Grand Prix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has made the small town of Watkins Glen famous throughout the country. Almost every legendary auto racer over the last 60 years has visited Schuyler County to race at the Glen and to pay homage to a man who helped make auto racing what it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cameron Argetsinger inherited a love for fast cars from his father and in 1947 bought his first sports car so he could become a member of the nascent Sports Car Club of America. With the desire to race his car, he organized a sports car race designed to appear like a European-style road race through the streets of Watkins Glen. That first race in Watkins Glen had only 23 cars participating and followed the route that Cameron Argetsinger laboriously planned on his living room floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten years later, after the road races moved to a new 2.3-mile course, Argetsinger brought full international races to Watkins Glen. In 1961, he inaugurated the U.S. Grand Prix for Formula 1, which had a successful 20 years' run in the Watkins Glen circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving Watkins Glen in 1970, he was executive vice president of Chaparral Cars and was subsequently director of professional racing and executive director of the Sports Car Club of America, SCCA, from 1971 to 1977. He also served as commissioner of the International Motor Sport Association from 1986 to 1992. Cameron Argetsinger was a member of the inaugural induction class of the Hall of Fame of the Sports Car Club of America in January of 2005. He is also in the Schuyler County, New York,  Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cameron Argetsinger loved sports cars and never looked back when chasing his dream. He was an attorney, a father, a grandfather, a racer, a husband, and an inspiration. He did what he loved, and he will be missed by the people of Watkins Glen, Schuyler County, and the world.</paragraph>
