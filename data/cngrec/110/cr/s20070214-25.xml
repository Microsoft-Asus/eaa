    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the Centralia High School boy's basketball team for 100 years of remarkable success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Centralia High Orphans have earned the distinction of being one of the "winningest" high school basketball teams in America. The Centralia basketball program began its winning career with a 2-and-2 record in its inaugural 1906-1907 season, less than a decade after the sport had been invented. In this their 100th season, the Orphans have amassed more than 1,975 career wins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the past 100 years, Centralia High has witnessed many legendary coaches and players. Coach Arthur Trout led the team to three State championships as well as an impressive 1941 season of 44 wins and only 2 losses. Coach Trout has an honored place in Centralia High's history where the new school gym bears his name today. Even now, many fans fondly recall the Orphans' all-time leading scorer, Dwight "Dike" Eddleman, who played for the team in the 1940s. Eddleman went on to letter in three  sports at the University of Illinois, won the silver medal in the high jump at the 1948 Paris Olympics, and played in the NBA. Other Orphans that represented Centralia in the NBA include Bobby Joe Mason, Ken McBride, and Dick Garrett.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be able to offer my congratulations to the Centralia High basketball team, Coach Randy Lincoln, and the town of Centralia, IL on reaching their 100th season, and I look forward to cherring on many more successful seasons of Orphans basketball in the future.</paragraph>
