    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, according to the Energy Information Agency, the United States currently imports about 60 percent of its oil, and that number is expected to rise to 75 percent in the coming decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a country, we need to reduce our dependency on foreign fuel sources and start implementing alternative energy sources that can be found domestically here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imported fuels such as crude oil and natural gas are costing the country billions of dollars a year, accounting for about one-third of the United States trade deficit. At $45 a barrel, liquid coal fuel is a desirable alternative to the $60 plus or more per barrel of oil we're paying today. Not only does this innovative fuel source cost less, but also coal is one of the most abundant natural resources in the United States. As Congress continues to explore the use of alternative energy sources,  we need to look closely at the enormous benefits of coal-to-liquid technology.</paragraph>
