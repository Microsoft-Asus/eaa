  <narrative>CONDEMNING THE ACCUSATION OF MOVEON.ORG -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10944]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rarely address this Chamber for 1 minute, but I cannot remain silent over the fact that 79 Members of this Chamber refused to condemn the accusation of MoveOn.org that General Petraeus, who has given 3 years of his life in service to our country in Iraq, has betrayed us. He had a message of hope and a recommendation that we not leave Iraq too quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether you agree with the general who commands our troops, he, and the troops he commands, deserve to know that all of us in Congress appreciate his service and will not be silent to such outrageous charges. MoveOn.org can say whatever it wants, but freedom of speech does not mean Congress must remain silent.</paragraph>
