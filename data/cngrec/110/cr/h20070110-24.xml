    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that my first public words on this sacred floor address an issue of utmost importance to the citizens of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will be considering <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, to give 13 million Americans a pay raise. This is legislation which I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing the minimum wage is necessary. It is a necessary step to help 38 million Americans living in poverty. Yet the Congress for almost 10 years has failed to assist this population by increasing the minimum wage to a decent wage. An increase in the minimum wage would help nearly 700,000 Georgia workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand it, Mr. Speaker, the majority leadership of the 109th Congress felt it necessary to award themselves a pay raise despite the fact that they worked just over 100 days in 2006. Given that more than half of Americans will benefit from this wage increase, I am looking forward to Americans getting a fair wage today and have this bill pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that more than half of Americans who will benefit from this wage increase work a full week every week, it is time for this Congress to increase the minimum wage and give America's hardest workers a fair wage for a fair day's work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
