    <paragraph>Mr. President, I submit a resolution which would modify the budget process to bring some sanity to the Senate as we consider the budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 13, less than a month ago, we took up the budget resolution. From 11:15 a.m. until 2 a.m, on March 14, this body was bedlam. May the record show the distinguished presiding Senator from Montana was nodding in the affirmative. If he wishes to have a disclaimer on that--he has just signaled it is OK with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two Senators on the floor of the Senate now, one presiding and one speaking, who can attest to an extraordinary event. The Senate is billed as the world's greatest deliberative body. During the time from 11:15 a.m. on the 13th, until 2 a.m. on the 14th, the place was bedlam--absolute bedlam. We were considering amendments which had not been available for examination by Senators or their staffs. We were considering them in a context of 2 minutes equally divided, so the proponent had  a full minute. That may be a little long for speeches in the House of Representatives, but it is not in the Senate. The opposite side had 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was impossible to hear what was going on in the Chamber. If you tried to listen to get the gravamen of what was going on, it simply could not be heard. During the course of the deliberations after midnight I had occasion to talk to the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, and the chair of the Rules Committee, Senator Feinstein, about doing something about it. My staff and I have done some research. We found that a resolution had been submitted, a proposal had been  submitted by Senator Byrd in the past. I have taken Senator Byrd's approach, having my staff consult with his staff. We do not yet have it worked out as to whether he will cosponsor because we have been in the period of recess for the past 2 weeks, but Senator Byrd is renowned for his expertise on parliamentary matters. The essence of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who may be watching on C-SPAN, it is impossible to deal with an amendment which has not been filed and printed so that staff and Senators can review it. When the amendments are offered--as there is a right to offer them, under the existing procedures, on the spur of the moment--nobody can follow them. One minute of explanation is totally insufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was one complex amendment which was offered with respect to the city of Berkeley, to take away their earmarks and their grants. I happened to be on the other end of the Chamber at the time and actually could not hear; the bedlam, the noise just precluded hearing. I later found out that there was a lot more to the consideration of the issue than I could digest in the course of that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The procedures that have been used on the budget resolution have taken two forms which have subverted the process. One is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and the second is the resolution on deficit-neutral reserve funds to try to bring it within the confines of the budget resolution. Through those two artifices there are efforts made to legislate, put legislative proposals in the budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will ask unanimous consent my full statement be printed in the Record at the close of my comments. The full statement has a reference to amendment No. 4299, which was offered, which was on prescription drugs. It doesn't have anything to do with the budget resolution, but it was a sense of the Senate. This is just illustrative of substantive matters which are offered which have no place on the budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My prepared statement also refers to amendment No. 4231, which refers to immigration, a detailed proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these, if not most of these amendments, are "gotcha" amendments. I am getting a lot of agreement from the distinguished Presiding Officer. If anyone is watching on C-SPAN II, a "gotcha" amendment is an amendment that compels people to vote on complex questions which can be used on a 30-second commercial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the difficulties of campaign practice is to be able to defend your votes. It is sometimes hard to defend a vote on a complex matter where you have no advance notice of the issue and no opportunity to hear it debated. The procedures of the Senate, worth just a momentary comment, are, somebody proposes legislation and files it at the desk. It is referred to a committee. The committee has hearings. Then there is a markup where the bill is considered. Then the committee files a report, analyzing  it. Then it comes to the Senate floor for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the way the Senate is supposed to function. That is what makes the Senate, arguably, the world's greatest deliberative body. But not when you have amendments which are offered on the spur of the moment with no opportunity to know what is in the amendment and all of these votes are recorded. Try to explain a "gotcha" amendment as to why you voted a certain way in answering on a commercial. It just cannot be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope the Senate will take up this issue. I think the proposal by Senator Byrd on the scheduling is a good approach. I am not wedded to this approach. There are other approaches which could be undertaken which would be satisfactory to this Senator. We had some discussions on the Senate floor about perhaps limiting the number of amendments with a certification by the two leaders that you had germane amendments. But one way or another, we ought not to again next year undertake  a process which has 44 votes. That established a new record--although on prior years we came close to that with votes numbering in the thirties. We ought to avoid this kind of process and redo our procedures under the budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my full statement be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Bill Introduction</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 493--TO LIMIT CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS UNDER A BUDGET RESOLUTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation to provide greater efficiencies to what I believe is a broken process for consideration of the budget resolution. The need for reform is based on the most recent consideration of the budget resolution on March 13, 2008, when the Senate conducted 44 stacked roll call votes in one day--the so-called "vote-a-rama." With the 44 stacked votes, the frequent unavailability of amendment text in advance so there could be  no analysis and preparation, the chamber full of senators, the unusual noise level, the constant banging of the gavel by the presiding officer, the near impossibility of hearing even just the two minutes allotted for discussion, and consideration of matters entirely unrelated to the budget, I believe the process needs reform. The resolution I am introducing today is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the budget rules, once all debate time has been used or yielded back, the Senate must take action to agree to or to dispose of pending amendments before considering final passage. This scenario creates a dizzying process of voting on numerous amendments in a stacked sequence, often referred to as a "vote-a-rama." During the course of the "vote-a-rama", dozens of votes may occur with little or no explanation, often leaving Senators with insufficient information or time to deliberate  and evaluate the merits of an issue prior to casting a vote. By consent, the Senate has typically allowed two minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to votes. However, the budget process does not require Senators to file their amendments prior to their consideration. In many instances, members are voting on amendments</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Budget Act of 1974 outlines the many clearly defined rules for consideration of a budget resolution, including debate time and germaneness. Despite these rules, the Senate has often set aside these rules and found clever ways to circumvent the rules. To restore some order to the process, the resolution I am offering today would require first-degree amendments to be filed at the desk with the Journal Clerk prior to the 10th hour of debate. Accordingly, second-degree amendments must be filed  prior to the 20th hour of debate. This legislation would require a budget resolution to be set aside for one calendar day prior to the 40th hour of debate. Doing so would allow all filed amendments to be printed in the RECORD allowing Senators, and their staff,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another problem has been the subversion with the budget's germaneness rules by offering amendments to deal with authorization and substantive policy changes. It is important to remember that the Federal budget has two distinct but equally important purposes: the first is to provide a financial measure of federal expenditures, receipts, deficits, and debt levels; and the second is to provide the means for the Federal Government to efficiently collect and allocate resources. To keep the debate  focused, amendments to the budget resolution must be germane, meaning those which strike, increase or decrease numbers, or add language that restricts some power in the resolution. Otherwise, a point of order lies against the amendment, and 60 votes are required to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A sense of the Senate amendment allows a Senator to force members to either support or oppose any policy position they seek to propose. An excerpt of an amendment to the FY09 Budget Resolution follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.--It is the sense of the Senate that--(1) the leadership of the Senate should bring to the floor for full debate in 2008 comprehensive legislation that legalizes the importation of prescription drugs from highly industrialized countries with safe pharmaceutical infrastructures and creates a regulatory pathway to ensure that such drugs are safe; (2) such legislation should be given an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate; and (3) previous Senate approval of  3 amendments in support of prescription drug importation shows the Senate's strong support for passage of comprehensive importation legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The use of sense of the Senate amendments on the budget resolution has been discouraged in recent years because they have little relevance to the intended purpose of the budget resolution. As a result, it has become increasingly popular to offer deficit-neutral reserve fund amendments. Prior to the FY06 Budget Resolution, reserve funds were used sparingly. In in FY07, 22 were included in the Senate resolution and 8 in the House resolution; in FY08, 38 were included in the Senate resolution and  23 in the conference report; and in FY09, 31 were included in the Senate resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deficit-neutral reserve funds--which are specifically permitted by section 301(b)(7) of the Budget Act of 1974--have an important functional use in the budget process, but do not require extensive programmatic detail to be useful. On the speculation that Congress may enact legislation on a particular issue--perhaps "immigration," "energy," or "health care"--a reserve fund acts as a "placeholder" to allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to later revise the spending and revenue levels  in the budget so that the future deficit-neutral legislation would not be vulnerable to budgetary points of order. Absent a reserve fund, legislation which increases revenues to offset increases in direct spending would be subject to a Budget Act point of order because</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, it is unnecessary to include extensive programmatic detail into the language of a deficit-neutral reserve fund for it to be useful at a later date. An excerpt of an amendment to the FY09 Budget Resolution demonstrates the unnecessary level of programmatic detail that I refer to:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AMENDMENT NO. 4231 &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR BORDER SECURITY, IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, AND CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL PROGRAMS. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) IN GENERAL.--The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of 1 or more committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution by the amounts authorized to be appropriated for the programs described in paragraphs (1) through (6) in 1 or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or conference reports that funds border security, immigration enforcement, and criminal alien removal programs, including programs that--(1)  expand the zero tolerance prosecution policy for illegal entry (commonly known as "Operation Streamline") to all 20 border sectors; (2) complete the 700 miles of pedestrian fencing required under section 102(b)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1103 note); (3) deploy up to 6,000 National Guard members to the southern border of the United States; (4) evaluate the 27 percent of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Voting on amendments that advocate substantive policy changes in the context of a budget debate are a subversion of the budget's germaneness requirements and clearly fall outside the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. In many instances, the programmatic detail is of a controversial nature, such as a recent amendment to "provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for transferring funding for Berkeley, CA earmarks to the Marine Corps" (Coburn Amendment No. 4380).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To bring the focus back to the budget, my legislation states that "provisions contained in a budget resolution, or amendments thereto, shall not include programmatic detail not within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on the Budget." It is my hope that this language will bring about a change in practice in the Senate whereby Senators will avoid including excessive programmatic detail in their reserve fund amendments. Doing so will put the focus back on the important purposes of a budget  resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions in my legislation may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members. Also, an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate is required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee for their hard work in processing amendments to the budget resolution. Unfortunately, the process needs reforms to provide structure and to increase transparency and efficiency. The 44 rollcall votes conducted in relation to <bill type="sc" number="70">S. Con. Res. 70</bill> are the largest number of votes held in one session dating back to 1964, according to records maintained by the Senate Historical Office. The Senate cast more votes on the budget in one  day than it had previously cast all year on various other issues. It is my hope that this resolution, modeled in part on a previous proposal by Senator BYRD, will lead us to a more constructive debate on the budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the support of my colleagues.</paragraph>
