  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9669">S9669</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are getting used to Senators Enzi and Kennedy. They seem to have been on the floor for several days now, and we have at least 1 more day, maybe part of another day, but I hope not--not because I don't want them here but because we have other things to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate is going to immediately proceed to <bill type="s" number="1642">S. 1642</bill>, the higher education reauthorization legislation. There will be no morning business. Under a previous agreement, there will be 8 hours for debate on the bill and amendments. First-degree amendments are limited to 12 amendments per side, with 6 for each manager and an additional managers' amendment, with first-degree amendments limited to 30 minutes for debate equally divided and any second-degree amendments limited to 15 minutes for debate  equally divided. So at approximately 5:15 today, we will begin voting on the pending amendments. We are hopeful we will be able to dispose of all of them this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the disposition of this bill, we are going to proceed to <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. I hope we can finish that bill quickly. I hope we don't have to file cloture on it. If we do, that is what we will do. Hopefully, we can finish the bill. It is extremely important. It deals with homeland security. I will tell all Senators, the bill we have calls for more money than the President's suggestion, but remember, we go to conference on all of these bills.  The House will have passed by the end of this week--certainly by the middle of next week--all the appropriations bills. So we need to get some done over here so that we can go to conference. So I repeat, if somebody has a concern about ours being for more money than the President's, don't worry about it. We have conference to go to, and as we know, in years past, the White House always has the ability to work with us in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we finish Homeland Security, we are going to go to the children's health bill, which is extremely important. It is important because the bill that has been brought before the Senate is one that is a compromise, a bipartisan piece of legislation, a bill that was reported out of the committee by a 17-to-4 vote. That certainly suggests bipartisanship, and it provides health care for millions of American children. So I hope we can get consent to proceed to this legislation following Homeland  Security. If not, we will file cloture, and we will go to it after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as everyone has heard me say, this work period, we are going to complete Homeland Security, SCHIP, we are going to complete the conference report on the 9/11 Commission recommendations, we are going to complete work on the ethics and lobbying reform, and we are going to move to another appropriations bill, which will be Military Construction and VA. All  Senators and staff should be alerted that we may have to work weekends. I say plural because it  is according to where we are on the procedural matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend, I know there is a big trip planned to go to Greenland, and we certainly hope Senators can go there. It is something everyone needs to see and Senators need to see, with global warming being as it is. We will do our best to complete work so that people can have the weekend off to go to Greenland and to do whatever they need to do. But there are no guarantees in this business, especially at this time of the year. We worked all night one night last week, we worked until early in the  morning one night, and that may be necessary this week and next week. I hope we can break in time for our recess, but, again, as I have said now for weeks, we have to finish this work first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope people who have amendments on this bill today will come and start offering them. We are going to make sure that all quorum time is charged against the bill itself so we can finish that time. The time, we are going to finish today; the amendments, we hope to finish today.</paragraph>
