  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to honor a colleague, ally and a dear friend, Rick Diegel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 1 of this year, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the union to which I proudly belong, said goodbye to long-time political legislative department director Rick Diegel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Diegel, who has been one of the most influential labor voices on Capitol Hill, is a true champion for American workers, not just organized workers, but all workers and their families. I have known and relied on his good counsel for more than 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Brother Diegel, the IBEW has become a respected leader on policies that affect American working men and women as they try to provide for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brother Diegel represents the true spirit of public service. A Vietnam veteran, he served in the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before he came to Washington, Brother Diegel was active in politics in his native Texas. And for the record, I don't hold against him the fact that he is from Texas. In the 1970s, he served three terms as mayor pro-tem of the City of Ingleside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of Corpus Christie IBEW Local 278 in 1969, he worked for several contractors in Texas as a journeyman wireman and foreman. So, yes, he has worked with the tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was elected business manager in 1977, a post he held until his appointment in 1983 to COPE director at the international office here in D.C. He became director of IBEW's political legislative department in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Brother Diegel's greatest achievements has been his success in helping IBEW brothers and sisters get elected to public office, where they work to advance policies that work for working families. And his success has been amazing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More IBEW members have been elected to office than any other organization, labor or otherwise. And he has worked to create an office within the AFL-CIO to promote the election of working-class brothers and sisters to local, State, and Federal office throughout the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that effort continues to bear fruit. The more that we can bring the issues of average working Americans to the forefront, the more we can take back the machinery of government from those who would use it to benefit the narrow interests of the wealthy few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is through the leadership of Rick Diegel and the efforts of likeminded brothers and sisters across the Nation that we can ensure that the American Government is working for the people, all people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great sadness that I say goodbye to Rick and his wife, Theresa. But I will remember Rick's kindness, his compassion, and his dedication and strive to live up to those ideals in my work on the Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations on your retirement, Rick, and good luck. And as the Mexican saying goes, may you have love, success and now the time to enjoy them.</paragraph>
