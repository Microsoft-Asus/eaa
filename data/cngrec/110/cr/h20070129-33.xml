  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Americans are fed up with elected officials acting like they are better than everyone else. We have seen scandal after scandal on a bipartisan basis, and people are sick of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last year, in the face of several inappropriate acts from Members of this Congress, some of our leaders decided that we were above the law. I cannot disagree more. When a local business fails to file its taxes, we investigate. When a parent abuses a child, we investigate. If a Member of Congress abuses his or her position, law enforcement officers must have the authority to follow the evidence regardless of where it may lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen up America. Last week I introduced <bill type="h" number="88">H.R. 88</bill> that declares to our constituents that we agree with them: Members of Congress should not be above the law. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.</paragraph>
