    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two outstanding high school choirs from my district, the Chandler High School Chorale and the Highland High School Concert Choir. These groups were selected by competitive audition out of dozens of high schools across the country to perform on March 19, 2007, at New York's famed Carnegie Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chandler High School Chorale from Chandler, Arizona, has already distinguished itself as one of the top high school choirs in the Nation. Led by Dean Anderson, the chorale has performed across the country and around the world over the past two decades. This is the choir's second performance in the Carnegie Hall National High School Choral Festival, a singular achievement in the festival's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Highland High School Concert Choir of Gilbert, Arizona, has also secured a spot in the festival. Led by Rita Scholz, the concert choir has performed in the Arizona ACDA conference, the Arizona Music Educators Association Conference, and the 1998 MENC National Convention. The Highland High School choral music program consists of 170 students in five performing ensembles, presenting four concerts on campus per year, as well as other performances around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have two of the four schools in the Nation chosen from my district.</paragraph>
