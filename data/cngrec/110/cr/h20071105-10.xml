    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, kindly join me in honoring the memory of Naval Chief Petty Officer Patrick Wade from Manawa, Wisconsin, who perished in combat on July 17, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pat Wade was a true American patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some people spend their time talking about what they think is wrong in the world, Chief Wade spent his time doing what he knew was right. Believing in personal sacrifice for the betterment of others, he made a selfless commitment to defend all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rear Admiral Michael Tillotson, deputy commander of the naval Expeditionary Combat Command on which Wade served said, "Pat Wade gave his life saving lives. He was doing what he wanted."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult for most of us to comprehend such selflessness. Chief Wade's life was one of putting principle into practice. He wanted us to be not only better Americans, but better people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with this in mind, please join me in honoring his life of service.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
