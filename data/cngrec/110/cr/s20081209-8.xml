  <narrative>AUTO INDUSTRY REVIVAL -- (Senate - December 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10822">S10822</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>The auto industry is vitally important to our Nation's economy, and it is vitally important to my home State. This is not in dispute. The question before us is how to reverse the decline of some of those automobile manufacturers after decades of complicity between management and labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand congressional Democrats sent a revised proposal to which the majority leader referred, to the White House late last night. We will reserve our judgment until we see the latest text. But the proposal we saw yesterday afternoon fails to achieve our goal of securing long-term viability of ailing auto companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to support a bill that revives this industry. But I will not support a bill that revives the patient with taxpayer dollars, yet does not secure a commitment that the patient will change its ways so future help is not needed. To do so would be a betrayal of the millions of hardworking taxpayers who are not at fault for the troubles in the auto industry. It would be unfair to the millions of Americans who depend on these companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the management side, the draft plan released yesterday fails to require the kind of serious reform that will ensure long-term viability for struggling automobile companies. By giving the Government the option of cancelling Government assistance in the event that reforms are not achieved, rather than requiring it, we open the door to unlimited Federal subsidies in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, we should demand management make the tough choices that are required for long-term viability. This is the only fair approach from the standpoint of the taxpayer who is footing the bill. On the labor side, this bill proposal fails to require any serious reform of legacy costs. Indeed, it states explicitly that one of its purposes is to preserve the same retirement and health care benefits that have made these companies so uncompetitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is delusional to expect a company that spends $71 per labor hour to compete with a company in a neighboring State that spends $49 per labor hour. In short, this proposal is deeply flawed because it fails to assure taxpayers, who rightly expect us to be good stewards of their hard-earned money, that they will not be asked to shell out billions more in a few years or even a few months from now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are times when help is needed. But one thing most people expect when they are asked for help is that the one asking makes a commitment to change. This proposal does not go nearly far enough. It holds neither management nor labor truly accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In areas where one side is held accountable, the other side is not. One example is a provision that requires automakers to drop all legal challenges to State fuel economy standards that are inconsistent with the Federal standard. Where is the offer from our friends on the other side to call on environmental groups to drop their lawsuits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats say they want to solve this problem as much as we do. Yet they seem all too eager to tip the scales to the detriment of the manufacturers. Look, there is plenty of blame to go around for the problems that ail the auto industry, but fixing half of a problem is not a real solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any successful proposal would force companies to reform, either inside of bankruptcy or outside of bankruptcy. Without that mandate, there can be no real expectation of reform. A good proposal would force automakers to get control of their benefit costs. A good proposal would make wages of struggling companies competitive with other automakers, not tomorrow but today. A good proposal would end the practice of paying workers who do not work. A good proposal would rationalize dealer networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as struggling airlines adjust their capacity to respond to market conditions, automakers must respond to market demands as well. I regret that the proposal Republicans saw yesterday afternoon does not do enough to fix the whole problem. It subsidizes it. A real solution must protect the taxpayers by forcing the changes needed to put these companies on the path to long-term success.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the lifeline we throw to Detroit has to be one that gets them to shore, not part way to shore. That is why I indicated in my opening statement that during the night there has been a lot of give-and-take between the White House and the two banking committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I reported earlier, I think there are only two major issues that are still outstanding, and I am confident and hopeful they can be resolved in the next few hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue before us is, what can we do to stabilize an industry that has direct impact upon 2.5 million jobs in this country. The mere fact that we were trying to work something out yesterday caused the stock market to go up almost 300 points. The American people want us to try to resolve this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But my friend is right. As strongly connected as I am to organized labor, it cannot be a one-sided proposal that is brought before the Senate. I am confident it will not be. I have talked to the Big Three operators. Some are held in low repute. But that withstanding, I think we are in a situation now where we all have to kind of join hands, recognize that this is going to be a compromise, we are going to try to work something out. That is what legislation is all about, the art of compromise and  consensus building. That is where we are now. As I indicated, I think we are very close to having something that I think we can bring before the body sometime today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
