  <narrative>BOEING VS. AIRBUS -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1993]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the decision made by the United States Air Force to choose a foreign company for their new refueling tanker. The recent Air Force decision to give the KC-X tanker contract to Airbus jeopardizes our national security. We should not send a contract that could potentially be worth more than $40 billion to a foreign company when we have a viable American option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Airbus is a company that receives European government subsidies. Boeing, with the support of the government, is currently fighting Airbus at the World Trade Organization on the basis that they have an unfair advantage from these subsidies. What message does this send when our own government is fighting these subsidies on one hand and rewarding them with a $40 billion contract on the other?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Tacoma News Tribune recently said, "The Air Force's job was to make a business decision. Now Congress has to make a policy decision, and there's room for legitimate debate." Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly agree.</paragraph>
