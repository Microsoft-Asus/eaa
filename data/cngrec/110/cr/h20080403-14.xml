  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, was before us at the Joint Economic Committee. Chairman Bernanke noted many negative factors for the current economy, increased unemployment claims, increased food and energy prices, and it has reduced Americans' confidence in the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, we have all seen news reports about the Federal Reserve's unprecedented actions aimed at increasing liquidity, stabilizing credit markets, and protecting a Wall Street investment bank from bankruptcy. Despite these dramatic measures, liquidity remains limited, and with only news reports to go on, the American public seems unsure about whether government is acting in their best interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Reserve needs to start clearly informing the American public about the impact of its actions. This openness would encourage sensible economic policy, bring stability to the markets, and help restore individuals' confidence in the government and in our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of homeowners are struggling to make mortgage payments or have already lost their homes, and they do not feel like their government is helping them. The Federal Reserve needs to clearly communicate better to the American people.</paragraph>
