  <narrative>HONORING ABIGAIL TAYLOR -- (Senate - May 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4788">S4788</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last fall I came before the Senate to ask my colleagues to join me in passing the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act on behalf of an amazing little girl, Abigail Taylor, of Edina MN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in December of 2007, with Abigail as our inspiration, Congress answered the call. We not only passed the bill, but working with the Taylor family and child safety experts, we included provisions in the legislation to create tough new safety standards that require all existing public pools with single drains to install the latest drain safety technology. On December 19,  2007, the President signed the Pool and Spa Safety Act into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most touching moments in my time in the Senate was that day in December when I was able to call Scott Taylor from the Senate cloakroom to let him know that the pool safety bill had passed. Abbey may have been a small girl, but there is no doubt she had a super-sized impact on our world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning, Abbey said she wanted her story told so that it would make a difference. And it did. Although Abbey is no longer with us, she will always live on through this important new law that will protect other children so they do not have to suffer what she did. I am certain that this new law would not have passed except for the inspiring courage of Abbey Taylor and her family. It was their gift to all the children of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Edina, MN, will designate May 24, 2008, as Abigail Taylor Day the day Abigail would have celebrated her seventh birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 24, I ask that we join in honoring Abbey Taylor, "Amazing Abigail" as we called her, and keep the entire Taylor family--Scott, Katey, Grace, Christina, and Audrey--in our thoughts. We owe them all a debt of gratitude for their courage and their pursuit of a safer America for all our children.</paragraph>
