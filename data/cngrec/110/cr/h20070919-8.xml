  <narrative>EARMARKING THE SWAMP -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10514]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after we Republicans lost the majority in last year's elections, the new majority promised that they would "drain the swamp." The new majority seemed to recognize that the political cost of earmarks far outweighed the benefits, and modest reforms were instituted to make the process more transparent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, it soon became clear that the earmark reform rhetoric was not matched by reality. The old majority seems just as mired in the mud as the old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, it was with some excitement that I recently discovered in the House-passed Interior appropriations bill a $750,000 earmark for the Great Swamp National Wildlife Preserve in New Jersey. Predictably, this earmark was not to drain the swamp, but to preserve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This begs the question: If we can't stop passing earmarks to preserve swamps, how will we ever drain the earmark swamp?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our constituents and this institution deserve far better. Let's follow up on our promises for earmark reform with actual reform.</paragraph>
