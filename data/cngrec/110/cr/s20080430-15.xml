  <narrative>ONE YEAR AFTER VIRGINIA TECH -- (Senate - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3587">S3587</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, April 16 marked 1 year since the deadliest shooting rampage in our Nation's history, a tragedy that took the lives of 32 Virginia Tech students and faculty members and wounded 17 more. April 16 was a day that forever changed the lives of many and we struggle to make sense of this senseless tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In almost 32 States, and on at least 32 college campuses, survivors and family members of those killed or injured in that shooting recently joined students, parents, and concerned citizens to remember the lives lost on April 16, 2007. During remembrance events across the country, hundreds laid silently on the ground in groups of 32 to honor the 32 innocent victims murdered at Virginia Tech. In my home State of Michigan, people gathered in Detroit and Kalamazoo to ring bells, read names, and recite  prayers, all to remember the victims of this horrible tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These commemorations also sought to remember the families and loved ones of the more than approximately 100,000 people who are killed or injured by a firearm every year in America. Hundreds joined in expressing their frustrations at the glaring gaps in our Nation's gun laws. In August 2007, a panel of experts, commissioned by Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, issued a report based upon their independent review of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. Among other things, the report pointed to weak enforcement  of and gaps in regulations regarding the purchase of guns, as well as holes in State and Federal laws. It also emphasized the critical need for improved background checks and the danger firearms can present on college campuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these calls from experts and outcries from the American people, the Congress has yet to act to make it harder for dangerous people to obtain dangerous weapons. By strengthening our background check system, closing the gun show loophole, and renewing the assault weapons ban we could help put an end to the type of tragedies such as the one that occurred at Virginia Tech.</paragraph>
