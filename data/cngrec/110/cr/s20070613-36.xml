    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize Faulkton, SD. The town of Faulkton will celebrate its 125th anniversary this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Faulkton was founded in 1882 and named after Territorial Governor Andrew J. Faulk. Located in Faulk County, it has served as the county seat since 1886. Faulkton has been a successful and thriving community for the past 125 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Faulkton on their anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
