  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. LEONE, JR. -- (Senate - November 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10557">S10557</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to honor Mr. John J. Leone, Jr. of Bristol, CT. A dedicated public servant who has served his community for over 40 years, John will retire from his position as president and CEO of the Greater Bristol Chamber of Commerce at the end of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John has been head of the Greater Bristol Chamber of Commerce, the third largest chamber in Connecticut, for 18 years. Under his leadership, the chamber grew immensely, going from 450 members to 1,820. John demonstrated a remarkable ability to bring people from all walks of life together behind a project. He played an integral role in securing State and Federal funding for the extension of route 72, which will help commuters in central Connecticut and provide a significant boost to merchants  in downtown Bristol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John's tenure with the chamber was the capstone of a lifetime spent serving Bristol. He was the mayor from 1984-1991, where he was elected to four terms. Before being elected mayor, he  was a cop for the Bristol Police Department. He has served as secretary of the Bristol Boys and Girls Club and as treasurer of the Metro Chambers of Commerce organization, which is composed of the seven largest chambers in Connecticut. He was also chairman of the Chambers  Benefit Leadership Council, which pools together businesses from Connecticut and western Massachusetts for the purpose of purchasing health benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the deep commitment John has shown for Bristol, it is no surprise that he intends to remain in the Mum City. I couldn't be more thrilled that such a devoted civil leader will still be part of the community. I am sure he will find ways to remain involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend to John Leone my sincerest thanks and heartfelt best wishes on a well deserved retirement. Connecticut is a better place because of him.</paragraph>
