    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in recognition of World AIDS Day, which millions around the globe commemorated on December 1. Although this event will be a recent memory as the new year begins, it is my hope that its purpose will be reflected in our thoughts and actions throughout 2008 and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World AIDS Day is a solemn opportunity to remember that HIV/AIDS continues to wreak havoc on individuals, families, and communities around the globe. Although the new estimates on HIV prevalence is good news, we cannot forget that AIDS is still a leading cause of death. More than 5,700 lives are taken by this disease every day, many just at a time when they are attending school, raising children, or contributing to society as productive adults. At the same time, nearly 7,000 people become infected  every day, meaning that as 2.5 million more people--about as many people in my home state of Nevada--will face the start of the new year with HIV/AIDS. More than 30 million globally are already living with HIV/AIDS today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Nevada, the number of HIV and AIDS cases diagnosed each year since 2000 is on the upward trend, and AIDS rates continue to disproportionately impact ethnic and racial minorities. Our State also ranks 14th in the Nation for the rate of adolescents and adults living with AIDS. As a Nevadan, as well as a Member of Congress, I know that more must be done to tackle the epidemic at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Congress, we must continue to support international AIDS relief programs like PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. It should be a priority to fund vital programs that fight HIV/AIDS domestically as well, especially the Ryan White Care Act and the National Family Planning Program, which works to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Medicaid in particular is a lifeline for vulnerable HIV/AIDS patients who would otherwise have no other means of receiving  the care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In giving recognition to the human toll of the HIV/AIDS global epidemic, let us also heed the resulting call to action. From supporting prevention to treatment, individual remembrance to public awareness, let us all keep working together to ensure that the goals of World AIDS Day will soon become reality.</paragraph>
