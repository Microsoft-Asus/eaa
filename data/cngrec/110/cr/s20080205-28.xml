  <narrative>RETIREMENT OF MARTIN "MARTY" PAONE -- (Senate - February 05, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="657">S657</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, secretary for the majority, Mr. Martin Paone, is leaving the U.S. Senate. I am personally saddened by Marty's decision because I have known and worked with Marty for nearly 30 years. I take great pride in the fact that, as Senate majority leader, I hired young Marty to work in the Senate Democratic Cloakroom in 1979. Three years later, I promoted him to the floor staff of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In both positions, Marty performed his work for the Senate with incredible dedication and professionalism. In fact, in a floor statement I made on October 11, 1988, I acknowledged the "disciplined, orderly thinking" which Marty had brought to his work in the Senate, and complimented him on his "calm demeanor under pressure."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was most pleased, but not surprised, when Senate Majority Leader Mitchell selected Marty Paone to be assistant secretary for the majority, and Senate Majority Leaders Daschle and Reid chose him to be secretary for the majority. This last position, of course, is one of the most important positions in the Senate. The secretary for the majority is regarded as the Senate's "chief legislative officer" because the office digests and processes all legislative proposals which come before  the Senate. Marty thoroughly mastered his difficult and demanding responsibilities. He has carefully studied the Senate's rules and precedents. He understands how this great institution really works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dedication and diligence which Marty brought to every position in which he has served the Senate have only been enhanced by his friendly, helpful demeanor. Marty Paone was always on the job and at the top of his game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it will be hard to say goodbye, but I wish Marty and his lovely wife Ruby, also a Senate staffer, all the happiness in the world.</paragraph>
