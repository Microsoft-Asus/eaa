    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me as I honor the life of Sacramento sheriff's deputy Vu Dinh Nguyen, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on December 19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Nguyen dedicated his career to law enforcement and public safety. He was a member of the Sacramento Sheriff's Department for 7 years, serving as a member of the gang unit for 3 years. Prior to his career with the Sheriff's Department, he was a probation officer for Sacramento County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vu Nguyen was born in Vietnam in 1970 and immigrated to the United States in 1975. His family settled in Modesto, CA, where he attended Burbank Elementary School, Mark Twain Junior High School, and Modesto High School. While attending Modesto High School he participated in several activities including football, yearbook, and student government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vu continued his education at California State University, Sacramento, where he graduated cum laude with a degree in criminal justice. He continued to excel at the Sheriff's Academy where he graduated with high honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Nguyen was married in April and is survived by his wife Phanh, parents, five sisters, and two brothers. His family, friends, and colleagues remember him as a humble man, a respected officer, and an ambassador for the Sheriff's Department in the Asian-American community where he often reached out to troubled youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Vu Nguyen's brave service and commitment to public safety will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
