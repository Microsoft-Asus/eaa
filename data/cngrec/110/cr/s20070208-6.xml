    <paragraph>Mr. President, today following whatever time the leaders might utilize, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour, the first 30 minutes will be for the majority, the second 30 minutes will be for the Republicans. Once morning business closes, under a previous order, the Senate will return to executive session and conclude the debate on the Casey nomination. Up to 30 minutes of debate is in order, and that time will be equally divided and controlled between Senators</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the Chair, I direct a question to my distinguished counterpart, the Senator from Kentucky. I would like to take about 10 minutes prior to the vote on Casey. We can put that in the order now, if you would like to also do that, and reserve that time, at least, whether you decide to do that or not. Shall we reserve the time?</paragraph>
