  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO ROBERT KENNEDY -- (Senate - June 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5358">S5358</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to talk just for a moment today about the cloture vote on climate change legislation earlier today, but first, while I am getting some charts together, I wanted to mention also that this is the 40th anniversary that was yesterday of the death of Robert Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was driving to the Capitol listening to a news report about that day 40 years ago when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles, CA, and I was thinking about the fact that I was a very young man back then working on the Robert Kennedy Presidential campaign in my State when I heard that he had been assassinated. It was such an unbelievable blow to me and to all of the others who worked on the campaign and to so many other Americans who believed his campaign for the Presidency held such  great promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most young people in this country today know nothing about a 1968 Presidential campaign by Robert F. Kennedy. It was an extraordinary time, and he was an extraordinary man. I wish to read just a couple of comments by the late Robert F. Kennedy, who was, by the way, a Senator and served in this body, as well as served as Attorney General of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He gave a speech once that I have often quoted. It was a speech he gave in South Africa. Many will know these words. In his speech he said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events, and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of a generation ..... it is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of  energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He gave that speech June 6, 1966, at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. People often talk about those ripples of hope that can sweep down the mightiest walls of resistance and oppression, and that passion and that dream and belief still exist today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reread this morning the speech Robert Kennedy gave during his Presidential campaign in Indianapolis, IN, on the evening of April 4, 1968, when Martin Luther King was assassinated. The crowd that had gathered for Robert Kennedy's appearance did not know that Dr. Martin Luther King had been assassinated and Robert Kennedy came to that area of Indianapolis. He was asked not to go because of concerns about his safety. He went anyway and he gave one of the most wonderful speeches. It was without  a note, just an extemporaneous speech that had so much passion. I shall not read it today, but I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Ladies and Gentlemen--I'm only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening. Because .....</narrative>
  <narrative>I have some very sad news for all of you, and I think sad news for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.</narrative>
  <narrative>Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.</narrative>
  <narrative>For those of you who are black--considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible--you can be filled with bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge.</narrative>
  <narrative>We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization--black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love.</narrative>
  <narrative>For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can  also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.</narrative>
  <narrative>But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an effort to understand, to get beyond these rather difficult times.</narrative>
  <narrative>My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He once wrote: "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God."</narrative>
  <narrative>What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.</narrative>
  <narrative>(Interrupted by applause)</narrative>
  <narrative>So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King, yeah that's true, but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love--a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke. We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We've had difficult times in the past. And we will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not the end of disorder.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land.</narrative>
  <narrative>(Interrupted by applause)</narrative>
  <narrative>Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.</narrative>
  <narrative>Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people. Thank you very much. (Applause)--Robert F. Kennedy, April 4, 1968.</narrative>
