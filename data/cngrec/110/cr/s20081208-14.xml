  <narrative>REMEMBERING ALICE MARTIN KING -- (Senate - December 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10793">S10793</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Last night, Alice King, one of New Mexico's most respected and best loved citizens, died as a result of a stroke. This is a tremendous loss to our State, and certainly to her husband, former Governor Bruce King, and her sons Bill and Gary and all of the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who has lived in New Mexico for any amount of time in recent decades has actually felt they were a part of the King family in a way. Republicans and Democrats alike, ranchers or lawyers or pipefitters or schoolchildren, the Kings knew virtually everyone in our State, and nearly everyone in the State felt they knew the Kings. Certainly our State has benefited from the decades of public service the many members of the family have given, led by Bruce and Alice. He was the Governor of our  State three times in three different decades and by his side always was his partner Alice. He was at her side last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was always more than just the Governor's wife. She was a leader in our State on children's issues. She was the force behind the creation of a cabinet level department, the Department of Children, Youth and Families. A vigorous, tireless, undaunted advocate for children, she lifted them and their issues to the top of our State's list of priorities, and she was their champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Mexico has lost an invaluable citizen, one whose accomplishments are part of our history and part of our future. She was a great person, a great friend to many people, including my wife Anne and me. We join the King family in grieving the loss of this wonderful woman and remembering her with appreciation and love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
