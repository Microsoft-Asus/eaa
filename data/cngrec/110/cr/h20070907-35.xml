  <narrative>IN GOD WE TRUST -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10311]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues can understand me. I've got a little bit of laryngitis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, directly across from me, at the top of the Chamber is a depiction of Moses, and behind me, above the Speaker's rostrum is words, "In God We Trust."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of people in this country who have tried to get all symbols of religion, belief in God taken off of all public properties and coins and currency. Recently, there were thousands of coins minted without "In God We Trust" on them, and now they're talking about putting "In God We Trust" in an obscure place on coins so that people can't read it, right on the edge of the coin. I think this is--we're moving in a very, very wrong direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country was formed with a firm reliance on God Almighty, and when we start taking God out of everything, as some people want to do, we run the risk of having him turn his back on us. This Nation was formed and was founded with people praying every day in the Second Continental Congress when we had the Declaration of Independence and in Constitution Hall because they couldn't come to an agreement, and by prayer and supplication they were able to reach agreement; thus, we have the Declaration  of Independence, and we had our Constitution that has made this country so wonderfully powerful and respected around the world for the past 250 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who try to take God off of all things governmental, such as coinage or currency or in this Chamber, are making a terrible mistake, in my opinion. And I'm going to be introducing legislation that will demand or mandate that "In God We Trust" be maintained and retained on our currency and on our coinage in a prominent place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once you start turning your back on the good Lord, I think you are going to reap the whirlwind, and this is something this Nation cannot afford to do right now.</paragraph>
