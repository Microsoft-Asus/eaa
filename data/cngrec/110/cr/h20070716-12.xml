    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, America's National Guard is taking a crucial role in the global war on terrorism. They make up a vital part of our deployed forces, serving our country to stop terrorism overseas, protecting American families. I am proud the National Guard exceeded its recruitment goals for the month of June, which reflects the new greatest generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the month of May, the National Guard has 351,400 troops. Numbers have not been this high since November 2001. As a 31-year veteran of the Army National Guard, I understand the importance of their mission as explained by Captain James Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly grateful my former unit, the 218th Brigade, is serving in Afghanistan, where they're actively working to train the Afghani police and army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the father of four sons in the military, I am grateful for each and every American who decides to serve. Our all-volunteer Armed Forces are making the ultimate sacrifice, and today democracy is more widespread throughout the world than any time in history protecting American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
