  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Tweetsie Railroad, a western North Carolina fixture that has been providing fun and excitement to families for the past five decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tweetsie Railroad, founded in 1957, was North Carolina's first-ever amusement park. Nestled in the mountains of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, it is home to the classic steam locomotive Tweetsie 12.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tweetsie's historic lineage runs deep. This steam engine is the last remaining locomotive that ran a rail line connecting Boone, North Carolina, to Johnson City, Tennessee, through the rugged Appalachians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wild West theme of the park permeates every aspect of the family entertainment that draws families from all over. Tweetsie Railroad is in a category of its own, situated in a beautiful mountain setting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Away from the noise and rush of everyday life, this North Carolina fixture offers an escape from the worries of today with a glimpse of a bygone era. This retreat of family entertainment is part of a great American tradition, and I wish it many more years of delighting families with wholesome fun.</paragraph>
