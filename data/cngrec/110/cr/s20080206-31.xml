  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor Viorel G. "Vi" Stoia, a great South Dakotan who passed away on January 28, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vi Stoia was born on February 13, 1924 in Aberdeen, SD, and began his lifetime of service and leadership at Aberdeen Central High School where he served as senior class president. Vi continued this leadership and service while he served in the U.S. Navy and attended the University of Minnesota. In 1949, Vi graduated with a degree in business administration and married his lifelong companion, Donna Marie Maurseth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vi's thirst for knowledge along with his extraordinary leadership abilities served him well during his lifetime. His long and illustrious professional career included countless distinguished appointments, awards, and honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vi will be remembered by the Aberdeen community because of his exuberant service and dedication to constant improvement of the city, county, and State. Vi was a member of numerous community organizations, including the Aberdeen Jaycees and the Aberdeen Area Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, Vi's dedication and leadership were instrumental in rallying support for dozens of community projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The profound wisdom and deep commitment that Vi possessed is reflected through his role in the businesses, health organizations, educational affiliations, and political organizations for which he so diligently served throughout his life. Vi also received many awards recognizing his excellent work and service including: Distinguished Alumni Award--NSU, 1976; the George Award, 1979 and 1994; South Dakota Community Volunteer of the Year, 1991; Distinguished Service Award, Excellence in Economic  Development, 2000; and South Dakota Medal of Distinguished Excellence, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vi will be lovingly remembered by his wife Donna as well as his children and grandchildren as a loving husband, father, and a great man. He will forever remain in our hearts for his contributions to the Aberdeen area and the entire State of South Dakota. Few men will ever give as much of themselves or make as much of a difference in the lives of others as Vi Stoia. Today we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this great man. Although he does not stand among us, his legacy will live on for  a time without end. For all that has been accomplished and achieved, for all of the lives that have been touched and enhanced, thank you, and God bless Viorel G. Stoia.</paragraph>
