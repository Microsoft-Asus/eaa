  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, congratulations to our troops for capturing the highest ranking Iraqi in al Qaeda's leadership. Mashhadani, known to be the most senior Iraqi in al Qaeda leadership, operated as chief communicator between his terrorists and senior al Qaeda leaders, including bin Laden and Zawahiri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This arrest further confirms the connection between al Qaeda and Iraq and  the global terrorism network. I believe this news is significant in proving that the al Qaeda our troops are fighting in Iraq is inseparable in the front on the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops are fighting to protect American families. Stopping the terrorists in Iraq, which Zawahiri and bin Laden have identified as the central front in the global war on terrorism, is vital to this effort. Our troops' courageous efforts in Iraq are working, and we must support our brave men and women in uniform to defeat this enemy who promotes mass murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
