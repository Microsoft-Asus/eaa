    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you know, over the last 12 years, the Democrats have been in the minority, Republicans have been in the majority. The economy boomed in the late '90s. We had this tragic event on 9/11; it should have sent this country into a terrible depression, but this Congress, Republican majority, pushed through tax cuts that have allowed the economy to rebound and be robust and provide jobs and better standard of living. And in 2 months of talking about raising taxes and more  regulation and one committee chairman talking about  how he is going to undermine the President's national security policy, in just 2 months we have this terrible damage to the stock market, to the economy. Unbelievable. They were saying last night on the news that this is the biggest drop since 9/11. In 2 months of talking about all these new plans, we are going to cost people jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just encourage my friends across the aisle, be careful. We have built a great economy. Don't blow it quite so quickly.</paragraph>
