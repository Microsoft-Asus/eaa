  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition today to engage in a colloquy with a number of colleagues who have been true leaders on one of the most challenging issues facing the world today climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I stated on the floor several weeks ago, the time for action is now. According to the latest scientific findings of our world's leading experts--the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the confidence that humans are altering earth's climate has reached 90 percent certainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with this sense of urgency that I recently introduced, along with Senator Specter, the Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007. <bill type="s" number="1766">S. 1766</bill>--which is also supported by Senators Akaka, Murkowski, Casey, Stevens, and Harkin--is the product of over 2 years of deliberation and analysis and enjoys the support of many in industry, labor and conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Specter and I are convinced--and I believe my good colleagues from Connecticut and Virginia would agree--that legislation can only attract the bipartisan support needed to put the United States on a path to a low carbon economy if it contains the following: No. 1. mandatory limits on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions; No. 2, an economy-wide approach that meets the economic test of "no significant harm"; No. 3. increased incentives to accelerate the development and deployment of  low and zero emission technologies; No. 4. measures that strongly encourage our major trading partners to begin reducing emissions and that balance U.S. emission-reduction commitments with the necessity of engaging other countries; and No. 5. measures to allocate allowances under the program equitably and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately I am optimistic about our ability to forge bipartisan resolution of all of these issues because there is now such broad agreement within this body and within the business community and the general public about the need for real progress and action on this issue. At the same time, I recognize that we have work left to do. Senator Specter and I today hosted a meeting among many of the Nation's leading power producers to explore some new ideas for allocating emission permits  within the power sector. We were encouraged by this discussion and plan to broaden the discussion to include a wider array of consumer and environmental perspectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the legislation we have introduced and the outline you are sharing today differ in some important respects, I believe that we have a great deal in common. Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner, I stand ready to work to address our differences in the interest in forging a broad consensus capable of passing legislation this year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, for the enormous contribution his efforts have made to move the climate change debate forward. He has  taken the time to study and consider many of the nuts-and-bolts issues that are critical to developing a balanced approach, and we all are better informed for his efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like my friend, I stand here today very optimistic that we can forge bipartisan legislation. It is my honor to chair a subcommittee on climate change in the Environment and Public Works Committee and to have Senator Warner as my ranking member. Senator Boxer has shown great leadership and commitment to moving climate legislation through our full committee, and I look forward to working with her and all members of our committee to report out a strong bill in the fall. Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the debate recently has centered on what level of U.S. emissions reductions are necessary to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury to avoid catastrophic consequences. I believe that it is ultimately our moral responsibility to curb our emissions to avoid these consequences for those who follow us here on Earth. I also agree that we must ensure that our efforts to address climate change are consistent with our commitment to strengthening the U.S.  economy and our economic competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that some labor unions support the Low Carbon Economy Act, and while I also recognize that we are proposing approaches to cost-containment that overlap in part and differ in part, I am optimistic that we may be able to find a common way forward that will protect the environment and the economy. It is my personal belief that reducing climate pollution will ultimately provide a benefit to the U.S. economy; however Senator Warner and I recognize that there remain many in this body  who are deeply concerned about economic impacts from climate regulation. For these reasons, like Senators Bingaman and Specter, I am convinced that we must have robust cost-control measures in place in order to forge the bipartisan consensus needed for timely and aggressive action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world is looking toward the United States for leadership on climate change. Only with bipartisan leadership and quick action will we be able assume this leadership role. I appreciate my colleagues joining me today in this colloquy and pledge that I will work closely with them to ensure that the bill we report out of the Environment and Public Works Committee enjoys the broadest level of bipartisan support possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in commending the growing bipartisan movement to craft climate legislation that can pass this body. Senator Bingaman and I have been striving for some time to develop an approach that provides a deliberative and measured response to climate change. I agree with the criteria outlined today. Several of these elements were critical to my support for the Low Carbon Economy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I represent a State that relies heavily on manufacturing and coal production. We must craft climate change legislation that will protect the U.S. economy. It is critical that we not only provide funding to develop and deploy new climate-friendly technologies, but we must also find the most efficient way to drive these new technologies forward. One aspect of the bill I sponsored with Senator Bingaman that I want to highlight is designed to drive the development of carbon capture  and storage a technology that is critical to coal-producing States such as Pennsylvania. The bill provides a significant economic incentive to innovative companies willing to take on the challenge of building commercial-scale power plants that capture and store carbon dioxide emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, while I agree that the United States needs to take more aggressive steps here at home to address this issue, I also believe that any legislation must include provisions to ensure that we periodically review whether other countries are taking comparable action and that we be prepared to apply pressure on nations that continue to avoid implementing emissions limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this is an idea we all embrace and thank the Senators from the Environment and Public Works Committee for their willingness to work with us as they move legislation through the committee. We must bring together many interest groups in the fight against global warming. Only with broad support inside and outside of this chamber will we develop a bill that can pass.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to join with my colleagues in this colloquy on developing a bipartisan approach to addressing climate change. As my friend from Connecticut already stated, we have agreed on the principal outlines of a climate change proposal that we intend on moving through the Environment and Public Works Committee this fall. Climate change is a very big problem, and the solution will require a very big tent. In addition to the good work by my colleagues standing here  today, we also welcome continued leadership by Senators Carper and Alexander on our committee, Senators Kerry and Snowe in the Commerce Committee, Senators Biden and Lugar in Foreign Relations, and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can say with utmost confidence that Senator Lieberman and I embrace the principles for action described by our colleagues today. As always, the details matter a great deal. Senators Bingaman and Specter have clearly invested significant time and effort on this issue, and we truly welcome their input as we move legislation through the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like my colleagues, I believe that as we legislate on climate change we must be careful to protect our economy and pay special attention to those industries and regions that will bear the brunt of achieving necessary reductions. That is why last week I joined Senators Landrieu, Graham, and Lincoln in introducing legislation that I hope will allay the concerns of some Senators about the economic impacts of a cap-and-trade program. We have included this bipartisan measure in the  proposal Senator Lieberman and I have agreed to today. While I believe the cost-containment measures we have proposed present a sound basis for legislation, I, too, am open to consider a combination of efforts and ideas so long as the resulting product makes sense ecologically, economically and politically. It will not be easy, but if we can succeed in uniting our coalitions of support, I believe we will have the ability to pass climate legislation in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my 28 years in the Senate, I have focused above all on issues of national security, and I see the problem of global climate change as fitting within that focus. As with national security concerns, to succeed in addressing the threats of global climate change, we must be united at home.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friends and colleagues for their remarks and their commitment. We must approach this issue in a thoughtful and constructive way. It is my hope that we can take action on this issue by the end of the year. Let's not wait any longer when we know the one course of action we can't afford or defend is continued paralysis.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am committed to working with you and suggest that we bring our key staff together early in the recess to move this discussion forward. I think we all agree that these issues must be resolved and we can only benefit from a serious effort to try and resolve them together.</paragraph>
