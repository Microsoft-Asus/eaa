  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise for a moment to ask all Members of the Senate to join me in expressing their concern, their hopes, and their prayers for Congressman Charlie Norwood. Congressman Norwood, of Georgia, yesterday notified the House and the Senate that he would be returning to his home in Augusta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little over 2 years ago, CHARLIE had a lung transplant to try to correct a degenerative disease which he had had with him throughout his life. That transplant was successful and he returned to the House of Representatives and, as he always did, he represented the State of Georgia with courage, with dignity, and with tenacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, last year, cancer occurred in the lung and successfully was removed by surgery. But it has reappeared now in his liver. CHARLIE is fighting for his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His lovely wife Gloria is in Augusta with him, and his countless thousands of friends are there. But in this business that we go through in this Senate, there is always a time that all of us should reflect on the blessings we have, and that is the blessing of life. I pray now that the good Lord will look after CHARLIE and give him as much of that life as He possibly can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is also appropriate that we reflect a minute on how important his service in the Congress has been. We all know that domestically health care, affordability of health insurance, doctor-patient relationship is probably the singular thing the American people look to us to help solve. CHARLIE NORWOOD and his cosponsorship of Norwood-Dingell laid a platform for which one day many of those problems will be solved. He has fought tenaciously for better health care, for better patient-doctor  relationships, and a better relationship between the Federal Government and the providers of lifesaving health care around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this moment, while a champion of health care is in dire straits himself, I hope all Members will join me and pray that his recovery will be fast and swift and that God puts His blessed hand on his shoulder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
