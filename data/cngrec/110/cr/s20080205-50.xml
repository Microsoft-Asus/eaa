  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with the agreement we just entered on the economic stimulus bill, there will be a rollcall vote at 5:45 p.m. on the cloture motion on the Finance amendment. In addition, Senators should be aware rollcall votes are possible earlier in the day. I would hope that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have an agreement on FISA yet, but I have been given the assurance by my Republican colleagues that, for example, the amendment the  Presiding Officer and Senator Specter are going to offer should be debated tomorrow. There should be time before we have the 5:45 vote. We have a very important amendment to debate that has to be completed with Senator Dodd and Senator Feinstein regarding immunity. Senator Feinstein  has the ability to offer an amendment, and I hope we have votes on these and get rid of a lot of this tomorrow. We have been told the last few days that we could have some votes and we wind up not having votes, but I hope we can.</paragraph>
