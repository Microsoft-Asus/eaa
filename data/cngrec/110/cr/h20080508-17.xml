    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today because high gas prices are placing an increasingly heavy burden on everyone, including my fellow West Virginians. As gas prices continue to spike, we deserve a sound energy policy that creates new domestic sources of energy, increases supply and puts downward pressure on gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've supported anti-gouging legislation and called on the President to halt shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which could increase supply and possibly save as much as 24 cents from the price of a gallon of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've also increased fuel economy standards to make each gallon stretch a little further. Yet West Virginians deserve a more comprehensive, long-term solution that provides real stability and actually leads to the creation of new energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From clean coal to oil exploration and drilling to our desperate need for new refineries to expanded natural gas exploration, we have a wide range of options and ways to make a difference. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have stood in the way of a truly comprehensive energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time that Congress stop the rhetoric and work for real solutions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
