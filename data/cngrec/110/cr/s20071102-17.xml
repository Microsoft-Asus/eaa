  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="TRIBUTE TO JACK SPALDING SCHRODER, JR.">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I honor in the Record of the Senate Jack Spalding Schroder, Jr. of Atlanta, who is a great Georgian and a great American. I honor Jack upon his retirement from Alston &amp; Bird and for his work on behalf of the Georgia Hospital Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 32 years, Jack has served as lead legal counsel for the Georgia Hospital Association as an employee of Alston &amp; Bird and its predecessor. He has served alongside three different association presidents, beginning with Seldon Brown in 1975, and he has authored numerous articles on hospitals and healthcare. He helped pave the way in the 1980s for public, not-for-profit hospitals to transfer leadership to not-for-profit governing boards that reduced political pressures and enhanced fundraising  abilities. His efforts culminated in a major judicial victory at the Georgia Supreme Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack helped craft Georgia's first-ever Certificate of Need law, a law designed to control rising health care costs and preserve access to hospital services for all Georgians. In the past 10 years, while political pressures have forced other states to abandon Certificate of Need, Jack has been instrumental in helping Georgia preserve its successful Certificate of Need program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack also helped shape important pieces of indigent care-related legislation that were designed to preserve access to care for hundreds of thousands of indigent patients while strengthening Georgia's local, community hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his role as lead legal counsel for the Georgia Hospital Association, Jack has served as president of the Georgia Academy of Health Care Attorneys as well as on the boards of a number of prominent health care law groups such as the Atlanta Bar Association and the American Health Lawyers Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack has served as a tireless advocate for enhancing Georgia hospitals' ability to provide quality, cost-effective health care services to every Georgia resident. He and his wife Karen have earned the many happy years of retirement ahead of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of Jack Schroder to the health care industry, to the Georgia Hospital Association and to the State of Georgia.</paragraph>
