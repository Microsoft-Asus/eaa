    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6772">H.R. 6772</bill> which aims to rename the postal facility in the city of Fort Pierce, Florida, after CeeCee Ross Lyles, who was a flight attendant aboard United Airlines Flight 93 during the horrible attacks of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6772">H.R. 6772</bill>, which was introduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mahoney) on August 1, 2008, was reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on September 10, 2008, by voice vote. The measure has the support of Florida's entire House congressional delegation and recognizes Mrs. Lyles for the upstanding life she lived and the legacy she leaves behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CeeCee Ross Lyles has been described as a strong, smart, street-savvy young lady. Before becoming a flight attendant, she spent 6 years on the Fort Pierce Police Department where she worked her way from patrol officer to detective and was respected widely by her colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although CeeCee enjoyed working as a law enforcement officer, on October 11, 2000, she walked away from her job as a cop to pursue a lifelong goal of hers, which was to become an airline flight attendant. It was this decision that would lead her to join the ranks of United Airlines on the morning of September 11, 2001. Along with other crew members and passengers, she would be faced with the unthinkable, a hijacked airline carrier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moments before Flight 93 went down in the field of Shanksville, Pennsylvania, CeeCee dialed home twice on a cell phone to tell her husband, Lorne, of the hijacking and to send her love to her boys, Javon, Jerome, Justin and Jordon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A devout wife and mother to her sons, CeeCee lost her life far too early, like so many others on that tragic day in history. While last week the country stopped to remember the victims of 9/11, today we take a moment to acknowledge one individual in particular, and that is CeeCee Ross Lyles, crew member of Flight 93.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="6772">H.R. 6772</bill>, which renames the Orange Avenue Post Office in Fort Pierce, Florida, after Ms. Lyles, an honor certainly befitting of this fallen hero. Again, I urge passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1717 Orange Avenue in Fort Pierce, Florida, as the CeeCee Ross Lyles Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in Fort Pierce, CeeCee Ross Lyles was a role model in her community. She worked several jobs to support her family and still found time to volunteer at a local Christian women's shelter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6 years Lyles served at the Fort Pierce Police Department. During that  time she became known for her willingness to tackle fleeing criminals, worked her way up to detective, and was up for a promotion to sergeant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October 2000, Lyles saw a chance to pursue a lifelong dream and left the Fort Pierce Police Department. Through employment with United Airlines as a flight attendant, Lyles found new experiences and opportunities to travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, her life ended less than a year later, on September 11, 2001. Lyles was among the heroic crew on United Flight 93, which, along with the passengers on board that day, overtook the terrorists and prevented them from completing their diabolical plot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, the plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing the 44 people on board, but saving an untold number of American lives, including, perhaps, many of us as that plane almost certainly was headed for this building. Moments before the plane went down, Lyles called her husband and prayed for her family, herself and everyone aboard the plane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CeeCee Ross Lyles was a loving wife and mother and a devoted member of her community whose life was cut short by the tragic events on September 11, 2001. I urge my colleagues to support this bill in her memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6772">H.R. 6772</bill>, my bill to name the United States Post Office at 1717 Orange Avenue in Fort Pierce, Florida after CeeCee Ross Lyles, a true hero from my district who died tragically on September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Waxman and his staff for their help in moving this very important piece of legislation to the floor. I would also like to acknowledge my distinguished colleague, Mr. Hastings, who also represents Fort Pierce, for his support of the bill, and all the other colleagues who represent the State of Florida who unanimously support this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CeeCee Ross Lyles was a flight attendant on United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field on September 11. Passengers on the flight, along with CeeCee and other flight attendants, fought back against the hijackers after learning that other planes had been flown into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly before Flight 93 crashed, CeeCee called her husband, Lorne, and told him she loved him and she loved her children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CeeCee was born and raised in Fort Pierce where she served as a police officer for 6 years. In those years as a police officer, she had worked her way from patrol officer to detective, and was respected for her willingness to tackle fleeing criminals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fulfilling a lifelong goal to travel, she became a United Airlines flight attendant in 2000, where she served with distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CeeCee had a true and giving spirit. She loved her volunteer work at a women's shelter that two of her aunts helped found in Fort Pierce. Through her work at the shelter she served as a role model, showing women that they could make their own way if they tried hard enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to name this post office in honor of a true American hero, CeeCee Ross Lyles. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this most worthy hero.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6772">H.R. 6772</bill>, a resolution designating the post office located at 1717 Orange Avenue in Fort Pierce, Florida, as the "CeeCee Ross Lyles Post Office Building." As a cosponsor of this legislation, I would like to like to express my appreciation for the effort of my good friend from Florida, Congressman TIM MAHONEY, for introducing this important legislation. He and I share the privilege of representing Fort Pierce in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the designation of this post office we honor the memory of Ms. CeeCee Ross Lyles. Ms. Lyles was a flight attendant aboard United Flight 93 on that fateful day, 9/11 over 7 years ago. Shortly before the plane crashed, Ms. Lyles called her husband to tell her that she loved him. While her time on earth was cut short by terrorists, her memory will live on in our community. This post office designation will forever commemorate the life of Ms. Lyles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Lyles was a true Fort Pierce Floridian through and through. She was born and raised in Fort Pierce and later served as a police officer for 6 years there. In 2003, the City of Fort Pierce erected a statue of Ms. Lyles in the Liberty Garden at Veteran Memorial Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today ensures the memory of Ms. Lyles and all other 9/11 victims live on in our collective memory. I urge swift passage of this legislation to properly recognize and memorialize the heroes of 9/11 and the life of Ms. CeeCee Ross Lyles.</paragraph>
