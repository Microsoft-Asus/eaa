  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me give you four reasons why I think the resolution we will debate today is a bad resolution. Number one, it is nonbinding. It is a paper tiger. It does  nothing to influence our strategy or our direction in the global war with radical jihadists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it ill defines the enemy. It does not recognize that we are in a global war with radical jihadists who have attacked us around the world. Third, it omits recognizing key U.S. personnel that are serving, and serving ably, in this global war with radical jihadists. Why does it not recognize our intelligence professionals? Why does it not recognize our Armed Forces and intelligence professionals serving in Afghanistan, throughout the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, most ironic, the bottom line of this resolution tells the President to stay the course. That is not good enough. This is a tough enemy. We need to develop and evolve our strategy to be successful.</paragraph>
