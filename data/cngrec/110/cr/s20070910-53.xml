    <paragraph>Mr. President, we haven't made as much progress on the Transportation bill as I had wished, but we  are making progress. This is what happens with these complicated bills on occasion. Tomorrow night people should expect votes into the night. It will not be an early evening tomorrow. We have a lot to do on this bill. I have spoken to the distinguished Republican leader. Senator McConnell said they will have an alternative to the Mexican  truck measure offered by Senator Dorgan. Hopefully, sometime in the morning we can get those teed up for a vote. We also have been told by Senator Coburn that he has a number of amendments he wishes to offer. He said he would be here at 10:30 in the morning to begin offering those amendments. I have found Senator Coburn in the past doesn't need to talk very long, doesn't</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot to do. The fiscal year is coming to a close, and we have a number of must-do issues. We will work on those. I have spoken today, as I indicated, to the distinguished Republican leader about how we would proceed next week on Iraq matters. I think we are making progress on how we should proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are very hotly contested issues, very important. We want to make sure people have the opportunity to speak on this without delaying things for an extended period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow morning I am going to ask consent to go to conference on <bill type="h" number="1538">H.R. 1538</bill>, which is the Wounded Warrior/military pay raise bill. There was a Republican objection to that request the last time. I hope this time the result will be different so we can send this important bill, which means so much to our men in uniform, to conference. We need to send that to conference. So we will proceed to that unanimous consent request tomorrow morning. I will not do that tonight.</paragraph>
