  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would now like to yield 1 minute to our distinguished majority leader, Mr. STENY HOYER, the author of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, the distinguished representative from the State of Texas and a leader in our caucus and in our Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say how very proud I am to be associated with my good friend, SAM JOHNSON, an American hero not only to this body, but to veterans who have served in every one of our wars, and certainly the Korean War in particular. I thank him for his cosponsorship of this resolution with me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation granting the Korean War Veterans Association a Federal charter. It will enable them to expand its mission and further its charitable and benevolent causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Association, comprised exclusively of Korean War members, has more than 23,000 members and is one of the few such organizations of its size without a Federal charter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 50 years have passed since the war-weary men and women who served in Korea returned home. History has revealed that the sacrifices made by these brave soldiers was instrumental in stopping the expansion of communism, and that their sacrifice effectively contributed to a more peaceful world. Can one imagine if North Korea were in charge of all of Korea, what a dangerous world this would be? Granting this Federal charter is a small expression of our appreciation for the extraordinary  courage of our forces who were deployed to the Korean Peninsula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation is an opportunity to express our gratitude and respect for our military, past and present, and to give Korean War veterans the long-awaited recognition that they so deserve so that the so-called "forgotten war" is and should be forgotten no more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank, as I have done earlier, my colleague, Representative Sam Johnson, a decorated Korean and Vietnam veteran, for cosponsoring this legislation with me in the House. He honors our House by his service, as he honored this House and this country by his service in Korea and in Vietnam. I know that the Korean War veterans, his colleagues who stood the battle in Korea, are extraordinarily honored by his cosponsorship of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my good friend, Senator BEN CARDIN of Maryland, for his work on this issue in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an appropriate step for us to take. This recognition for our Nation's Korean War veterans is long overdue, but it is never too late to do the right thing. And I am pleased, Madam Speaker, to rise and urge my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution, and again thank the distinguished soldier who serves with us and served his country so well in battle.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to express my support for <bill type="s" number="1692">S. 1692</bill>, legislation that grants a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans are only familiar with the Korean War through the television series M*A*S*H. Yet, it was one of the defining conflicts of the 20th Century. Because of the courageous service of millions of American servicemen and women, the global spread of Communism was halted on the Korean peninsula. More than 36,000 Americans lost their lives to preserve the liberty of the South Korean people. The fall of the Iron Curtain. would have been inconceivable without their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Korean War Veterans Association was established in 1985 as the only veteran's organization comprised solely of Korean War Veterans. It now has over 25,000 members. The Association was founded in order to maintain a continuing interest in the welfare of veterans of the Korean War, to rehabilitate disabled veterans of the War, to establish facilities for the assistance of War veterans and to represent them in claims before the Department of Veterans Affairs without charge, and finally to perpetuate  and preserve the comradeship and friendships born on the field of battle and to honor the memory of the men and women who gave their lives in the Korean War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, on June 6 of last year, the Immigration Subcommittee adopted the following policy concerning the granting of new federal charters: The Subcommittee will not consider any legislation to grant new federal charters because such charters are unnecessary for the operations of any charitable, non-profit organization and falsely imply to the public that a chartered organization and its activities carry a congressional "seal of approval," or that the Federal Government is in some way responsible  for its operations. The Subcommittee believes that the significant resources required to properly investigate prospective chartered organizations and monitor them after their charters are granted could and should be spent instead on the Subcommittee's large range of legislative and other</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This policy represented the continuation of a policy the Subcommittee put in place at the start of the 101st Congress and has been continued every Congress since, against granting new federal charters to private, non-profit organizations. However, if the majority seeks to jettison the policy adopted by its own Judiciary Committee just last year, so be it. If we are to grant any organizations federal charters, then the Korean War Veterans Association should be at the top of the list. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my great honor to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Plano, Texas, a man of personal experience on what it's all about to be a Korean War veteran, a man who I believe brings to the House the kind of insight necessary to bring this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 5 million valiant men and women who served in the Korean War. Some may know the names Buzz Aldrin or John Glenn. You know, we all flew F-86s in the 51st Fighter Wing back then together. They were household names then. I flew 62 combat missions in the Korean War and got a chance to fly with Buzz many times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Capitol Hill, there are three of us who served in Korea in this Congress--CHARLIE RANGEL of New York, JOHN CONYERS of Michigan, and I. The Congress is better off because Korean War veterans are represented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They call the Korean War the "forgotten war" as STENY HOYER said. Nowhere is this more evident than the fact that the Korean War Veterans Association has not received a national charter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little known fact is that American prisoners of war in Korea endured even more severe treatment than those of us in Vietnam. In fact, they didn't even want to talk about it for years. Giving the Veterans of the Korean War a national charter will put them in the same echelon as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion, truly a mark of distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a Sam Johnson Korean War Veterans Group, chapter 270, in north Texas. The founder, Ed Buckman, a great patriot, did not talk about his history or his story for decades. It wasn't until a couple of years ago that he started sharing his experience and became a Korean War veteran champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed Buckman is the one who helped bring the need for a national charter to my attention. Mr. Buckman arrived home in Fort Worth after serving from 1950 to 1951 as a Navy electrical engineer aboard the USS Princeton. The Veterans of Foreign Wars advised him that because President Truman dubbed the conflict in Korea a "police action" and not a war, Mr. Buckman and other military personnel were not considered veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He once said he did not say the word "Korea" out loud for more than 40 years. He confided to the Dallas Morning News that he was bitter. "We were treated like dirt when we got home." Then, in 2000, he heard about a parade in New York City honoring veterans, including those from the Korean War. "When I went to this parade," he said, "with 25,000 marchers, they put me on the front float and there were a million people saying thank you. No one had ever thanked me for my service in Korea before,"  and he said "it made me feel proud." He tirelessly advocated a national charter for the Korean War veterans, and it brings me great pleasure to know that his hard work paid off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed Buckman, your country and your Congress are saying thank you for your sincere devotion to the cause by creating this long overdue national charter for all Korean War veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank STENY HOYER and the others in this Congress for helping do this. It's about time our Nation thanked the Korean War veterans for their service and sacrifice with national recognition and premier status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This July, we mark the 55th anniversary of the Korean War armistice. To the remaining one million plus Korean War veterans we will say, God bless you and God bless America. Your war and your efforts will not be forgotten. This is for you. America salutes you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) who also desires to rise to thank the Korean War veterans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 1692 which will grant this Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association. This day, as has been said already, is long, long overdue. Later this summer will mark the 55th anniversary of the armistice that ended the full-scale fighting in Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased the House will today pass legislation to finally grant the Korean War Veterans Association a Federal charter. My father, Senator Paul Sarbanes, introduced this legislation over several Congresses in an effort to get these veterans the recognition that they deserved. And although this legislation had been a priority of his and Leader Hoyer's for many years, we had been unable to get certain opponents to move out of the way and allow it to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, thanks to the majority leader and to Senator BEN CARDIN and to others who stepped forward with their support, we will finally send this legislation to the President for his signature, and it will become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is about recognizing the 5.7 million veterans who fought in the Korean War and more than 36,000 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country in that conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is also about fairness. A Federal charter will give the Korean War Veterans Association the same status as other major veteran services organizations and allow them to more efficiently assist their membership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Korean War is often called the "forgotten war." By passing this legislation, we take a modest step to reassure the Korean War veterans that we will never forget them and their tremendous sacrifice to our Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me rise in appreciation to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and the ranking member, Mr. Smith, in working with the Senate and working with the staff on this very important initiative. And I would like to acknowledge both former Senator Sarbanes, Senator Cardin, and of course our very, very able and distinguished and dedicated Majority Leader Hoyer in collaboration with Congressman Sarbanes to have this  legislation, <bill type="s" number="1692">S. 1692</bill>, move, which is to create the Korean War Veterans Association to become a Federally tax-exempt organization. It was a Federally tax-exempt corporation that was incorporated in the State of New York on June 25, 1985. And now this bill will grant a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The veterans association is an association of persons who have seen honorable service during the Korean War at any time between June 25, 1950 and January 31, 1955, both dates inclusive, and of certain other persons, the particular qualifications for membership to be set forth in the bylaws of the Korean War Veterans Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, the organization has established a strong record of service and commitment to fellow Korean War veterans ranging from the efforts on behalf of Project Freedom to a successful effort to construct a national Korean War veterans memorial on the National Mall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly personally want to thank my friend and colleague from Texas, Congressman Sam Johnson, who has never wavered from his commitment and dedication to the men and women of the United States military, to his love of Texas, and certainly to his particular love of those who served in the Korean War as he did, along with his service in the Vietnam War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made mention of our friends and colleagues, Congressman JOHN CONYERS and Congressman CHARLIE RANGEL. So today we honor them as we honor many, many of those who served. The Korean War, often overlooked in American history, is anything but forgotten by the nearly 1.2 million American veterans of the Korean War still alive today. And during the 3-year course of the war, some 5.7 million Americans were called to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And by the time the Korean War Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, more than 36,000 Americans sacrificed their lives, 103,284 were wounded, 7,140 were captured and 664 were missing. And so we know it was, in fact, a war that saw a painful time in American history but yet saw the valiant effort of our American soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American troops fought to protect our freedom as we know it today and paved the way for the United States to vanguard the movement for global democracy and liberty, a movement that afforded many countries the opportunity to shift to democratic regimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so it is a special honor to me to able to stand today and join my colleagues, to be able to support this legislation, <bill type="s" number="1692">S. 1692</bill>. I would ask my colleagues to support this legislation and be reminded that no war should ever be forgotten. We stand here today to acknowledge that the Korean War is not forgotten, and as well, that we will have the opportunity to celebrate in the passing of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for <bill type="s" number="1692">S. 1692</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="1692">S.1692</bill>, a bill to grant a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association. This legislation honors the sacrifice and courage of our soldiers who served in the Korean War. My distinguished colleague from Maryland, Senator BENJAMIN L. CARDIN and the Majority Leader STENY HOYER seek to recognize the heroic deeds of Korean War veterans by granting the Korean War Veterans Association Incorporated a Federal Charter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Korean War Veterans Association (KWVA) is a federally-tax exempt organization that was incorporated in the State of New York on June 25, 1985. Its original founder was Mr. William T. Norris, of New York, a member of F Company, 27th Infantry Regiment (Wolfhounds), 25th Infantry Division, when he served as a sergeant in the Korean War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides an opportunity for each of us, regardless of political views, religion, ethnicity, gender, or background to come together, and to recognize and honor our nation's heroes. We gather here today, in the midst of ongoing conflict and warfare, honoring the dedication of our men and women in uniform. Though we may be divided by our positions on the war in Iraq, we stand together to support all of our veterans, highlighting in this particular legislation those who fought in  the Korean War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country. We must be united in seeing to it that every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine is welcomed back with all the care and compassion this grateful nation can bestow. <bill type="s" number="1692">S.1692</bill> assists us in these endeavors by extending a small gesture of gratitude that grants a federal charter to an organization that promotes and maintains benevolent and charitable endeavors. The  Korean War Veterans Association is an association of persons who have seen honorable service during the Korean War at any time between June 25, 1950 and 31 January 1955, both dates inclusive, and of certain other persons, the particular qualifications for membership to be set forth in the by-laws of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Korean War, often overlooked in American history, is anything but forgotten by the nearly 1.2 million American veterans of the Korean War still alive today. During the three year course of the war, some 5.7 million Americans were called to serve, and by the time the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, more than 36,000 Americans sacrificed their lives, 103,284 were wounded, 7,140 were captured and 664 were missing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American troops fought to protect our freedom as we know it today and paved the way for the United States to vanguard the movement for global democracy and liberty; a movement that afforded many countries the opportunity to shift to democratic regimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, all too many of our veterans are left without the help and support they need to transition from the horrors they bravely faced on the front lines of battle to a successful civilian life. According to the Veteran's Affairs Department, as of 2006, on any given night, 196,000 veterans of all ages were homeless. As we work to curb this formidable reality, let us demonstrate our support for the veterans of the Korean War by supporting this legislation. This should encourage us to continue to  honor this nation's troops who are fighting and who have fought for the rights of all of us in places we do not dare to go, under environments we cannot fully appreciate from this comfortable position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that we should celebrate our veterans after every conflict, and I remain committed, as a Member of Congress, to both meeting the needs of veterans of previous wars, and to provide a fitting welcome home to those who are now serving. Veterans have kept their promise to serve our nation; they have willingly risked their lives to protect the country we all love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always been a strong supporter of our country's troops, male and female. That is why I introduced the House Concurrent Resolution 320 which celebrates one of our heroic daughters of Texas, Specialist Monica L. Brown of the United States Army with for her efforts earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spec. Brown was the first woman in Afghanistan and only the second female soldier since World War II to receive the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest medal for valor. This soldier from Lake Jackson, Texas was only 20-years-old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 25, 2007, Specialist Brown was part of a four-vehicle convoy patrolling near Jani Kheil in the eastern province of Paktia on April 25, 2007, when a bomb struck one of the Humvees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Spec. Brown saw her fellow soldiers were injured, she grabbed her aid bag and started running toward the burning vehicle as insurgents opened fire. All five wounded soldiers from her platoon scrambled out. Under this commotion, she assessed her patients and moved them to a safer location because they were still receiving incoming fire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other veteran's legislation that I am pursuing entails guaranteeing that our VA hospitals have the capacity to efficiently and effectively meet the needs of our troops. The Riverside Hospital in Houston, Texas is a historic medical center that has served the needs of veterans in the Houston area for a long time. However, currently, the hospital is lacking the tools necessary to treat the augmenting number of troops who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other common problems  associated with fighting in battle. Today, at this very second let us take a united stand for the well being of our veterans; to say the very least, they deserve it and to say the most; we've promised it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This attests to the fact that we must now ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans by extending our gratitude and appreciation. Currently, there are over 25 million veterans in the United States. There are more than 1,633,000 veterans living in Texas and more than 32,000 veterans living in my Congressional district alone. I hope we will all take the time to show appreciation to those who have answered the call to duty. As the Winston Churchill famously stated, "Never in the field of  human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few." This recognition for our nation's Korean War Veterans is long overdue, and it is a small expression of appreciation our nation can offer to these men and women, and it will enable them to ensure that the "Forgotten War" is forgotten no more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we approach the 55th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting and serving those who have served this nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="1692">S. 1692</bill>, a measure to grant a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association (KWVA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the Korean War is sometimes referred to as the "Forgotten War," it is among the most significant events of the 20th century. Communist military aggression was defeated and the United States and its allies sent a signal to the world that militaristic expansion of communism would be countered with force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 6 million Americans served during the Korean War, and tens of thousands of them faced some of history's most adverse circumstances and challenges for the cause of freedom--by the time the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, more than 36,000 Americans had died, 103,284 had been wounded, 7,140 were captured, and 664 were missing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The heroism displayed by Korean War veterans should never be forgotten. We can help honor the 1.2 million American veterans of the Korean War who are still alive today by granting a Federal charter to America's oldest and largest association of Korea veterans. KWVA is a 20,000-member veterans' service organization devoted exclusively to Korean War veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why we should approve <bill type="s" number="1692">S. 1692</bill> calling on Congress to grant a Federal charter to KWVA. This recognition is well deserved, and I am hopeful that Congress will act swiftly to approve this measure. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="5854">H.R. 5854</bill>, a bill to grant a Federal charter to the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MOAA is the largest professional association for military officers and the fourth largest  veterans group in the Nation. With 370,000 members, MOAA has a distinguished 79-year history of service to the military community, veterans, and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like KWVA, MOAA is among the veterans' service organizations without a Federal charter. In addition to the deserved recognition it would accord MOAA, a Federal charter would enable some state-level MOAA affiliates to participate on governor-appointed advisory councils to which they are presently excluded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to grant a Federal charter for KWVA, and I would also encourage my colleagues to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="5854">H.R. 5854</bill> to grant a Federal charter to MOAA.</paragraph>
