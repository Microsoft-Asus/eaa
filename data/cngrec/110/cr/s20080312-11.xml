    <paragraph>Mr. President, there has been progress made on a farm bill. We can't leave here without doing a farm bill. I think it is something we need to do. We worked hard. We have agreed on how much money it is going to take. I had a meeting yesterday with Senator Harkin and Senator Baucus on our side. They have had good working relationships with their counterparts, Senators GRASSLEY and CHAMBLISS. They are working well with their House counterparts. We have had  a little setback because Chairman Rangel has been hospitalized. We were hopeful that he would be out today. In fact, we had a meeting scheduled today. But he is not going to be back to work today. That has slowed us up a little bit. But we all look toward doing a farm bill. It is something we need to do, and we are going to work very hard on a bipartisan basis, which is the only way we can have a farm bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me add to the remarks of the majority leader that I, too, believe it is important to have a farm bill. It has been a challenging process, to say the least, for our negotiators, but they continue to make progress. I, too, am optimistic that we can get there. I think it is important to the country that we do get  there. This extension we just passed was regretfully necessary, but it doesn't lessen in any way the  need to get a farm bill, a 5- or 6-year extension, depending upon what is negotiated. We are continuing to work along those lines and hope to get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
