    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week I was pleased to join Senator Hagel and 66 other Senators in introducing <bill type="sr" number="122">S. Res. 122</bill>, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. As the unanimous approval of this resolution suggests, showing respect for the memorial and those it honors is a unifying action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I remember that it has not always been so. For a time, it was controversial to speak in support of the memorial that honors and recognizes the more than 58,000 servicemembers who gave their lives in Vietnam and the more than 3 million men and women who served there. In fact, for some time it was even controversial to support the war's veterans themselves. As our troops returned home from Vietnam, far too many returned to face the ridicule and contempt of their fellow Americans. When the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was organized in 1979 for the purpose of establishing a memorial for those who served in the war, both living and dead, it faced an uphill battle. We can all be grateful that supporters persevered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 25 years since the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated, we have made much progress as a country and can now honor Vietnam veterans and the memorial that honors them without dissension. Known to many as "the Wall," it has become the most popular memorial in our Nation's Capital, attracting an estimated 4.4 million visitors each year. Many of them leave behind offerings to the men and women lost in Vietnam, such as letters, medals, birthday cards and roses. These offerings, which now  number more than 100,000, are preserved at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People visit the Wall for many reasons: to honor, to heal, and to be reminded of the human costs of war. One veteran described the Memorial this way: "It's a quiet place where I can stand and remember my friends. And that's all I would like to do."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like so many other Americans, I am grateful for the healing power of the Wall. May it continue to honor, heal, and remind us all of the consequences of war.</paragraph>
