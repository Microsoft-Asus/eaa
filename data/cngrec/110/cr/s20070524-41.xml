    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe deeply that the well-being of our society depends on the contributions of committed individuals. With that belief in mind, today I pay tribute to an individual who has given much to many, most especially to veterans in my home State of Hawaii, Dr. Kathleen McNamara.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. McNamara is a psychologist who has spent 18 years working full time for veterans, with most of that time spent in Hawaii. Her full career spans longer than that, and includes impressive service across a range of issues in psychology. Recently, the American Psychological Association presented Dr. McNamara with a Presidential Citation in recognition of the more than 30 years she has dedicated to the American people, including veterans. Dr. McNamara has served on many of the APA's volunteer  boards, including their board of directors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have interacted with Dr. McNamara both in her role as psychologist and in her work with the veterans' community. I have found her to be thorough and of strong conviction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall a witness who was testifying at a January 2006 hearing of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This witness was speaking on behalf of veterans from the Hawaiian island of Molokai, where it can take over 3 months to get an appointment with a visiting VA psychologist. This witness told the committee about Dr. McNamara, who routinely travels to Molokai from a neighboring island. He called Dr. McNamara  the "Mother Theresa for the veterans," and  noted that Molokai needed more psychologists, because the demand to see Dr. McNamara was just so great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I humbly offer Dr. McNamara my gratitude for what she has done for veterans, for Hawaii, and for our Nation.</paragraph>
