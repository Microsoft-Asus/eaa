  <narrative>PASS TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH PERU, PANAMA AND COLOMBIA -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9190]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, trade is important to my home State of Illinois. One in five manufacturing jobs depends on trade; 40 percent of agricultural products are exported from Illinois; and I would note, of the 17,000 Illinois companies that are dependent on trade, the vast majority are small employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a great opportunity with some new trade agreements with Peru, Panama, and Colombia. They are important both for Illinois jobs as well as for democratic security in our hemisphere. I would note today for our friends in Panama, Peru and Colombia, their products come to the United States tax free. But when we sell our products to them, we pay taxes. Our partners have agreed to eliminate those taxes and level the playing field. It is time to honor our commitments with our trading partners.  Unfortunately, some in the Democratic leadership have said they would reject a deal with our best friend in Latin America, Colombia, and have told our other trading partners they just are not worthy of a trade agreement. No wonder so many in Latin America think the United States Congress is turning its back on Latin America. Peru, Panama and Colombia represent our best allies. They are good trade agreements. Let's move forward and level the playing field. Pass these trade agreements.</paragraph>
