    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to speak about an upstanding citizen of Colorado--Lewis Entz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former State Senator Entz will be receiving an honorary degree from Adams State College at their spring commencement on May 5, 2007. This honor will be bestowed upon him in recognition of the work he has done for the college and, more importantly, the San Luis Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lew Entz is the owner and operator of Entz Farms. He is a licensed pilot, a husband and father of four, and a Marine Corps veteran of the Korean war. Before spending nearly 20 years serving the people of region in the Colorado General Assembly, he was an Alamosa County commissioner for 14 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I served in the Colorado Legislature with then-Representative Entz for 8 years. We worked together on small airports, agriculture, and water. During all my time dealing with him, I learned enough to heartily agree with the board of trustees of Adams State College in their assessment of his value to his community, region, and State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lew's vast knowledge of Colorado's complex water laws was incredibly important to his district. Water is the most important aspect of existence in the San Luis Valley. Lew, as a farmer, has a full appreciation of this. Lew tirelessly worked for years to protect this resource for his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no one who has served the people of the San Luis Valley more vigorously or better than Lew Entz. I congratulate him on this honor from Adams State College, and want to thank him for his four decades of service to the people of the San Luis Valley and the State of Colorado.</paragraph>
