  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are all so proud on both sides of the aisle of the work that our servicemembers are doing in military theaters abroad, in Iraq and Afghanistan and so many places around the world. And we should be just as proud of the work they do when they come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to share with my colleagues the extraordinary heroism of Brian James Ivory. Mr. Ivory was a very proud member of the United States Marine Corps. He served in Iraq. He crewed aircraft flying in and out of some very dangerous places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also stationed in North Carolina where he assisted in search and rescue missions, and he came home to Long Island when his deployment ended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 17, he was driving home from work at night and he saw a vehicle in front of him hit a utility pole and erupt into flames. This young man, who had already served and sacrificed for his country, who had already paid his dues, rather than driving on and just calling the police, stopped his car, called the authorities and then pulled the driver out of the car, risking his life one more time, not in Iraq, but on the Long Island Expressway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend this gentleman for his heroism. This is a story that I know is not unique. The point here is that we not simply celebrate the sacrifices and the heroism of our servicemembers when they go abroad to fight our battles, but we also keep in mind their bravery, their courage, their commitment, their dedication, their loyalty to protecting human life when they return home.</paragraph>
