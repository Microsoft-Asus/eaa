  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month my congressional office was flooded with letters asking me to cosponsor the National Eosinophil Awareness Week Resolution. All of these heartfelt notes, as it turned out, were authored by the family and friends of an 11-year-old girl who lives in my district, Jessica Seidel. Jessica and her mother are here with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jessica suffers from a rare eosinophil disorder that causes her body to mistake common proteins as foreign bodies. The disorder makes Jessica's life very hard. Only last week, she had to move out of her house because her basement flooded, rendering the house unliveable for her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these challenges, Jessica remains a remarkable girl. She is visiting me here in Washington today, and I am impressed by her poise and her courage. I am very pleased that on Monday, the House unanimously approved the Eosinophil Awareness Week Resolution. Our vote was meaningful and it was important, not only to Jessica and her family and friends, but to every sufferer of an eosinophilic disorder across the United States.</paragraph>
