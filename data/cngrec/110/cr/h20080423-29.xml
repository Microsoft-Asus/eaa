  <narrative>WHAT ARE THE DEMOCRATS' SOLUTIONS TO HIGH GAS PRICES? -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2559]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to read a few floor comments, if I could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This one is made July 28, 2005, in a floor statement by Congressman Jim McDermott:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Republicans have written a bill that favors corporate America over mainstream America. Sixty dollars for a barrel of oil that breaks the backs and the budgets of mainstream Americans is a scandal."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wonder what Mr. McDermott thinks about $119 a barrel of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on April 20, 2005, in a floor statement, then minority leader Nancy Pelosi said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Republican energy bill is warmed-over stew of old provisions and outdated policies. Democrats have better ideas."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I challenge the Democrats to bring forth these better ideas because since the Democrats have taken control, gas prices are up over $1.25 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, May 23, 2006, in a floor statement by Mr. Frank Pallone:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"As Americans prepare to travel this weekend for the Memorial Day holiday, they should know that Democrats are offering real solutions."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Pallone, we need to see those solutions.</paragraph>
