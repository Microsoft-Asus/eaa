  <narrative>AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (Senate - September 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8475">S8475</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for <bill type="s" number="3406">S. 3406</bill>, The Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008. Like the original ADA, this legislation is the result of extensive bipartisan effort; and I would take this opportunity to commend Senators Hatch and Harkin for their leadership on this issue. I would also note that this legislation was supported by a wide range of stakeholder groups in the employer and disability communities. These groups participated extensively in  the development and negotiation of this legislation and it can safely be said that without their participation this bill would not be a reality today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="3406">S. 3406</bill> was principally crafted as a response to a number of Court cases that many observers felt had interpreted the ADA too narrowly, and, therefore, denied coverage to individuals that the statute was originally intended to cover. The legislation clarifies the legislative intent. It retains the inherently functional definition of disability from the original ADA; and continues to require that in order for a physical or mental impairment to rise to the level of a covered disability it must  substantially limit one or more of an individual's major life activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring that individuals with disabilities are free from discrimination, and fostering their full inclusion in the workplace and in all other aspects of life are singularly important goals and responsibilities. It is also equally important to continually monitor our laws, and, as we do today, amend them, to make certain these goals and responsibilities are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever changes are made in existing law, however, we must be mindful of the likelihood of increased litigation in the aftermath of such changes. The drafters of <bill type="s" number="3406">S. 3406</bill> have attempted to be as clear as possible in an effort to avoid the type of confusion that could spawn such excessive litigation. That said, we are not unmindful of the concerns expressed by some smaller businesses in this regard. Those businesses should recognize that this legislation was intended to ensure restored coverage  for individuals that all of us recognize are entitled to the law's protection; and that the legislation was not intended to promote litigation or prop up questionable or frivolous claims of coverage. Just as Congress has monitored the original ADA and acts today to correct problems with its interpretation, it will continue to monitor the amended ADA and take action in the event it is abused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note that there have been some concerns expressed by both institutions of higher education and boards of professional certification that this bill would somehow change the fundamental nature of the service which a covered entity provides or lower the standards for professional certification. As to the latter, it should be expressly noted that nothing in the legislation affects the standards for professional certifications; and, as to the former, the legislation itself does not require  that accommodations be extended where to do so would alter the fundamental nature of the services being provided. These would seem to be fair safeguards against the legitimate concerns expressed by some stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that we pass today will hopefully help to aid in the full integration of those with disabilities into all aspects of society. It is an important piece in the strategy for achieving this end, but we must remember it is only a piece and cannot be the only strategy. Despite the existence of the ADA the workforce participation levels for individuals with disabilities have remained unacceptably low. We therefore need to think of approaches beyond the traditional enforcement of rights  statutes in an effort to achieve the goal of the full participation of all our citizens in the benefits of our society and economy.</paragraph>
