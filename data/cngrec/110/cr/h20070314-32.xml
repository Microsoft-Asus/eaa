    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>) to promote openness in Government by strengthening section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes, as amended.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census and National Archives, and lead sponsor of the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007, I strongly urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> champions the values of transparency and open government that we celebrate during Sunshine Week and that are embodied in the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, as it is referred to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Introduced with my colleagues Representative Waxman, chairman of the full Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Representative Platts, this bipartisan legislation is necessary to strengthen FOIA as a tool for enabling public access to government records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a hearing in February, the subcommittee heard extensive testimony concerning long delays and bureaucratic obstacles experienced by requesters when trying to obtain government records under FOIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to testimony from GAO, most agencies throughout the government are failing to keep pace with the volume of requests they are receiving, the number of pending requests carried over from year to year has been steadily increasing, and the rate of increase is growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A report released on Monday by the nonprofit National Security Archive further highlights the failure of agencies to make information available to the public in a timely way. According to the report, just 22 percent of agencies are complying with the 1996 "e-FOIA law," which requires agencies to post frequently requested information on their Web sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An insufficient level of resources available for FOIA processing is one reason requesters are being forced to wait long periods of time for responses from agency FOIA offices. Another factor is the current administration's policy of withholding government information that would have been released under previous administrations. Government secrecy has increased as the volume of requests has gone up dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Building on the OPEN Government Act introduced in the last Congress by Senators CORNYN and LEAHY and Representative LAMAR SMITH, <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> contains 13 substantive provisions aimed at removing obstacles to complete and timely government responses to FOIA requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would re-establish the policy of the Clinton administration, under which agencies were directed to disclose requested information unless the disclosure would result in some harm. The current administration has encouraged agencies to be more aggressive in asserting statutory exemptions to deny FOIA requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill proposes a government-wide ombudsman to mediate disputes between agencies and requesters. This would help to reduce the number of disputes resolved through costly and time consuming litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other key provisions include: A requirement that agencies respond to FOIA requests within 20 business days or face meaningful administrative penalties; the establishment of a publicly accessible tracking system for pending FOIA requests; and new reporting requirements to allow Congress to evaluate agency compliance with FOIA laws and regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> provides a strong, reasonable and bipartisan approach to streamlining the FOIA process and increasing transparency in government. It has the vigorous support of every major organization representing the media industry, journalists, historians, archivists and the public interest in government openness and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to our constituents to pass this legislation and ensure that the Freedom of Information Act provides actual access to government information to which the American people are entitled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a bit of irony in play here on the House floor. This week the Democratic leadership has declared it Open Government Week, Open Government Week as we take up amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, an act that is incredibly important as a tool for us to hold our government accountable because it gives people the opportunity to access information that can be reviewed by people to determine what action needs to be taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, unfortunately, in the middle of this Open Government Week we have a bill that is coming to the floor, not the bill that went to the committee, not the bill that went through the subcommittee hearings, but an amended bill that has not been reviewed, and was handed to us 10 minutes ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the reason why bills come on the Suspension Calendar where we agree to suspend the rules is because they are bills that have been fully vetted, that have openness to them, and that people are aware of what they are and have the opportunity to review them when we have an understanding that more than a majority of this House supports what is in that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today, without prior notice, and 10-minute amendments to the bill, we have a bill that we are currently reviewing to determine what changes have been made and what the implications would be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the speakers on the other side of the aisle talked about in Open Government Week that we wanted to make certain that there weren't backroom deals that were being made. Well, clearly the bill, unfortunately, that comes before us on the Freedom of Information Act is the product of a backroom deal where the majority of this House is going to be left with reviewing it to determine what is in it after it had come through our committee and subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my comments about this bill will be about the one that came from the committee and the subcommittee that the subcommittee Chair and the chairman worked so hard in a bipartisan way to bring to this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know others on this side of the aisle will be reserving their comments for the areas of the bill where it has been modified, where the backroom deals have been made. And we are all unaware of its impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Freedom of Information Act is a popular tool for inquiry for the press, researchers, business, attorneys, activists. But most importantly, it remains a tool for the citizen. Improving the procedural aspects of the act is certainly a worthy goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation designed to streamline and improve the Freedom of Information Act process was introduced last Congress by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith). His bill, <bill type="h" number="867">H.R. 867</bill>, has moved through subcommittee to the full committee. This was a solid bipartisanship bill that Republicans introduced and guided through the legislative process. This year the majority took that bipartisanship bill and made a few changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans offered two amendments that were not included in the reported  bill. First, the attorneys' fee provision appears to significantly lower the bar for the recovery of fees, making it easier for those seeking information from the Federal Government to recover legal fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in this bill differs from that in <bill type="h" number="867">H.R. 867</bill>. The Supreme Court has ruled on this matter in the Buckhannon case, and now some fear the effect of this decision, what it might have on their ability to get attorneys' fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language of section 4 of this bill would make plaintiffs eligible for attorneys' fees in almost any case, so long as they can show that the defending government agency somehow changed its position once the case had commenced. I hope we can closely consider the rationale behind this provision, and its implications for the numerous Federal statutes providing for attorneys' fee awards where the United States or a Federal agency or official is a party. You have to assume that if this is the provision  that passes, everyone litigating under any private right of action will clamor for the same favorable legislative treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An amendment was offered in committee to strike section 4 to preserve settled judicial precedent regarding attorneys' fees and highlight this issue. I hope my colleagues in the House and the other body will take a close look at this section as the legislation moves forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the majority has taken to heart various groups' concerns about the so-called Ashcroft memo. During President Clinton's administration, Attorney General Janet Reno issued a memorandum establishing a presumption of disclosure if no foreseeable harm would result from the release of information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after 9/11, and recognizing the challenges of the standard and the challenges that we face in the global war on terror, Attorney General Ashcroft issued a memorandum that encouraged agencies to carefully consider the protection of the values of interest embodied in the statutory exemptions to FOIA when making disclosure determinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that there are serious concerns with this section, and I understand the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) will speak on this bill and this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, I hope that we continue to balance the need for open government with the need to protect information vital to national security and homeland security, and I hope we keep in mind the importance of individual privacy throughout this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman from California, Mr. Waxman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Clay, the chairman of the subcommittee, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio, the ranking member of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I first of all have to express my regret in response to the complaint that, while we have openness in government, we had an amendment to this bill suddenly presented to the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And let me explain why that happened. The legislation before us was completely bipartisan in committee. I don't think anybody voted against the bill passing out of our committee, for all the reasons that both the Chair of the subcommittee and the ranking member described, and I would like to get into those substantive issues as well, because this is the best known and most important of the freedom of information that people look to when they want to be able to find out what government is doing.  It is called the Freedom of Information Act for that reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we did not have presented to us in committee any objection to the fact that there is a score on this bill of $7 million. But because there is a score, we found out last night that there might be an objection to the bill; and we didn't want to have an objection to the bill, possibly cause people to come to the floor and vote against something as important as the Freedom of Information Act. So we added an amendment to the bill that simply provided that the $7 million, which, by the way, is  only expended if the government is sued and loses and has to pay the penalty owed to people for withholding the information. But because there is a $7 million score, we added to this bill that there would be nothing paid unless there is an appropriation of that money. So the bill would not be scored as costing any money at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish we had more time to bring this to everyone's attention, but no one brought to our attention in the committee that there was concern about this score.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, this bill goes to the heart of the public's access to find out information about what its government is doing. And as we look at what we have designated "Sunshine Week," we are considering this legislation to improve and strengthen this vital law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> has been in effect for 40 years, but yet we have a dozen provisions that will increase public access to information under FOIA. These provisions will help FOIA requesters obtain timely responses to their requests, reduce the backlogs at agencies, increase transparency in agency compliance, and provide an alternative to litigation for requesters who are facing delays or denials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this bill will restore an important element of the Freedom of Information Act, the presumption of disclosure. Through memoranda issued in 2001 and 2002, the Bush administration discouraged agencies from releasing any document if they could find a technical reason for withholding it. This bill before us today reverses this policy by codifying the presumption of disclosure. Under this bill, agencies will revert to their former policies that emphasized public disclosure and supported  the withholding of information only when the agency could foresee a harm from disclosure. This is an important change that will ensure continued public access to government information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is a bipartisan bill, it is an important bill for openness in government, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's description of that. I do want to note that my understanding of the applicable dates are that the markup of our bill occurred on March 8 and the CBO cost estimate I believe is dated March 12, which would explain perhaps why there were no objections in the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to oppose the bill not on the merits of the FOIA policy, but on the grounds that this bill had a budget section 303 point of order against it and that it violated the new PAYGO rules we have before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill that we just now got 10 minutes ago, as we read it, we believe does not violate section 303 of the Budget Act or the PAYGO rules. But I think the point I would like to make is this: 10 minutes ago this bill did have a section 303 violation against it; 10 minutes ago this bill did violate the majority's own PAYGO rules they put in place less than 10 months ago. And it scores not just a $7 million, but a $63 million increase over 10 years. So $63 million over 10 years is a lot of money.  And given the fact that this new amended bill, as it appears as we read it, does have the required language, subject to appropriations, that it is not out of order, it doesn't waive the PAYGO rules because it does pay for itself subject to appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will withhold my objection, but I simply want to say to the majority this place would run a lot better if, when we put bills on the calendar and bring them to the floor, that they comply with the rules that the majority themselves put in place just 2 months ago with respect to PAYGO and with respect to the Budget Act. I just think the whole place would work a lot better if we do that. Then we get on to debating the merits of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think FOIA is an important tool. It needs to work better. I think there is a lot of merit to that point. But let's make sure that as we take a look at our budget problems, and they are enormous, our budget problems, if we can't make sure that bills that spend $63 million over 10 years can't comply with the Budget Act, can't comply with PAYGO, who is to say that bills that spend $2.9 trillion like our Federal budget can comply with it? So if we  can't  get the rules right on small bills, who is to say we are going to get the budget discipline rules right on the big bills?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fiscal discipline starts one step at a time, starts one bill at a time. We have got to get fiscal discipline rules in place and right on small business, especially if this Congress is going to get our arms around our larger fiscal problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is simply the point I want to make to the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I just want to say what is seldom said on the House floor, that I agree with you. And we tried to correct the problems so that we didn't make the error that would have violated our PAYGO principles. And I thank the gentleman for pointing it out, and I think you have raised a very good point and we should all be mindful of it, including the points about the deficit, which I strongly think we need to deal with. So we will have differences  about that, but I do want to show my agreement with your basic statement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Ohio yielding me time, and I also want to thank Ranking Member Tom Davis and Chairman Henry Waxman for their hard work on this issue. I know how strongly they feel about the need for more open government, and I and many others appreciate their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome, and Federal agencies have become less and less responsive to requests for information. This deters citizens from obtaining information to which they are entitled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>, the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007, has much to recommend it, but it contains at least one fatal flaw, the statutory presumption of disclosure. For that reason, I oppose this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The presumption of disclosure would reverse the FOIA guidelines set out by former Attorney General John Ashcroft. Shortly after September 11, 2001, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft directed that FOIA be used to ensure an open and accountable system of government while at the same time protecting national security and personal privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The directive encouraged agencies, when making a decision on discretionary disclosure, to carefully consider whether national security, privacy, and government's interest would be jeopardized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this bill only exacerbates national security and personal privacy concerns. Instead of allowing agency discretion regarding national security concerns, this statutory language would mandate the release of information if the information does not blatantly fall under an existing exemption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For instance, under the bill's language there is no discretion to determine whether the information requested will invade personal privacy. Also, if information requested is required by FOIA to be released, under this language it could tip off a terrorist to an investigation that is being conducted. So the bill could set in motion events that could compromise our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, neither the House nor Senate bipartisan legislation included this questionable presumption of disclosure language. It is my understanding that this year's bipartisan Senate version also will not include this questionable language. And, furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the administration opposes this provision, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no good reason to support a flawed bill, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent to have the statement of opposition by the administration be made a part of the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statement of Administration Policy--H.R. 1309--Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007--(Rep. Clay (D) Missouri and two cosponsors)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration shares the goals of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> of increasing the timeliness of Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, responses and ensuring a customer-oriented approach to FOIA processing. The Administration has been pursuing these goals, and will be continuing to pursue them, through the strong management review and reforms that the President directed 15 months ago in the first-ever Executive Order on FOIA--Executive Order 13392, "Improving Agency Disclosure of Information"--which he signed  on December 14, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Administration cannot support <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>. The Administration believes it would be premature and counterproductive to the goals of increasing timeliness and improving customer service to amend FOIA before agencies have had sufficient time to implement the FOIA improvements that the President directed them to develop, put into place, monitor, and report on during FYs 2006 and 2007. For example, as explained below, several of the bill's provisions would impose substantial administrative  and financial burdens on the Executive Branch. These provisions could result in slower, not faster, agency processing of FOIA requests, and the personnel and funds needed to implement them would have to come from existing agency resources. Moreover, the agency reports that were issued last</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration's specific concerns with the bill include the following.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration strongly opposes expanding the definition of "representative of the news media." The bill would exempt a larger class of requesters from the obligation to pay fees assessed for searching for responsive documents. Expanding the definition would have serious fiscal consequences for the Executive Branch. Moreover, with no requirement that requesters pay search fees, they have no incentive to tailor their requests and will likely make overly broad requests, which, in turn, will  stretch agency resources and increase the time it takes to process all requests. Further, under current law, agencies have authority to waive or reduce fees upon a determination that disclosure of information will contribute significantly to public understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration also strongly opposes reinstating the so-called "catalyst theory" for the reimbursement of FOIA litigation fees. The Administration is concerned that its reinstatement would serve as a disincentive to an agency's voluntarily revisiting decisions and improving procedures with respect to FOIA requests, because doing so could make the agency liable for a complainant's legal fees. Furthermore, the bill could be interpreted to include an "administrative action" through the FOIA  appeals process as a possible means by which a requester can obtain "relief" that would justify attorneys fees. Such an interpretation would be a major departure from long-standing administrative law practice and would severely undercut the traditional function of the administrative appeal process, which is designed to provide</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration strongly opposes commencing the 20-day time limit for processing FOIA requests on the date that the request "is first received by the agency," and preventing the collection of search fees if the timeline is not met. This provision represents a very significant change from current practice in which the 20-day clock begins once the appropriate element of an agency has received the request in accordance with the agency's FOIA regulations. The provision fails to take into account  the complexity of many requests, the need to consult with other Executive Branch entities, or the need to search for records in multiple locations, including at Federal records centers. As noted above, the Executive Order requires agencies to implement improvement</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration is opposed to the creation of an "Office of Government Information Services" within the National Archives and any intent that the proposed Office would be given any sort of policymaking role with respect to FOIA compliance. The FOIA compliance function remains appropriately placed with the Department of Justice, the lead agency in implementing Executive Order 13392.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Administration strongly opposes the provision in the bill that appears to be an attempt to repeal Attorney General Ashcroft's FOIA Memorandum and return to Attorney General Reno's pre-9/11 FOIA guidance. The Administration believes that the structure of the FOIA reflects the appropriate balance between the public's right to know how the government is operating and the equally important need to safeguard certain information, such as that pertaining to personal privacy or homeland  security.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 4 minutes to my distinguished colleague from New York (Mrs. Maloney).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership, along with Mr. Waxman, on working on so many sunshine bills to make government more open and accountable to the citizens, to our taxpayers, to the American public. And an important part of sunshine is the Freedom of Information Act Amendments, it is a tremendously important bill, <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>, of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since coming to Congress, I have been working on this committee, and improved FOIA processes which are critical to an open government and making our government more transparent is very fundamental to our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made improvement over the years, and I am pleased to have been one of the authors of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act of 1996. This important law was intended to make FOIA more efficient by providing public access to information, including in an electronic format.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which I am a member, has held many hearings on FOIA over the past few years, and we have learned that it has not progressed as well as we had hoped. Some agencies and Departments are doing a better job of fulfilling freedom of information requests, while some continue to have terrible records and lag far, far behind. Requesters often wait months or years to find out the status of their requests or to obtain the information. And I am pleased that  we have report language that clarifies that they have to get back quickly on requests and at least let them know where they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, the backlogs at agencies and Departments continue to grow, and frequently the only recourse for the denial of requested information is to file lawsuits. But many people, many Americans cannot afford the high costs associated with court costs. So by not moving in a timely manner, you are depriving them of this information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> includes many important provisions that my colleagues have spoken about and that I hope will improve the process and eliminate the problems that exist in today's system, including an amendment that I offered in committee that would provide for greater disclosure to the FOIA requester about the exemption under which a deletion has been made from requested material.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I often hear from constituents, they come to my office with piles of FOIA requests and like the whole thing is redacted and there is absolutely no explanation why. This is really not fair, and we hope that this amendment will improve the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that it was accepted in a bipartisan way by Ranking Member Davis and Ranking Member Turner. I really feel this legislation is long overdue, and I commend Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis and Chairman Clay and Ranking Member Turner for bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor with the many other very important sunshine bills to make our government more open and accountable to the American public.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Platts).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>, the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Open and accountable government make up the cornerstones of good government. This legislation before us today seeks to strengthen these cornerstones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Freedom of Information Act was signed into law over 40 years ago, in July 1966, enacted after 11 years of debate. FOIA established a statutory right of public access to executive branch information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FOIA provides that any person has the right to obtain Federal agency records. Originally, the act included nine categories of information protected from disclosure, and Congress has added additional exemptions over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Balancing the need for open government with the needs to protect information vital to national security and personal privacy is a constant struggle. Federal Departments and agencies are operating in the post-9/11 information age and face 21st century security, information management, and resource challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we seek to achieve this balance we must remember the words of Thomas Jefferson who said, "Information is the currency of democracy." FOIA is an essential tool to ensure that the citizens of our great Nation have access to information in the way that Thomas Jefferson envisioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past several years, the Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Finance, and Accountability, on which I had the privilege to serve as Chair, conducted multiple hearings on FOIA implementation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In response to legislative proposals introduced last session in the House and Senate, as well as the oversight conducted by the subcommittee, President Bush issued Executive Order 13392, entitled Improving Agency Disclosure of Information, on December 14, 2005. This document sought to improve the overall processing of FOIA requests, creating a more citizen-centered and results-oriented approach to information policy. And I certainly commend the administration for their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to that effort, though, we believed further work was needed. On September 27, 2006, the subcommittee marked up legislation very similar to that legislation before us here today. Specifically, the OPEN Government Act, introduced by my colleague from Texas, LAMAR SMITH, like the bill before us today, would close loopholes in FOIA, help requesters obtain more timely response, and provide FOIA officials with the tools they need to ensure that the Federal Government remains open  and accessible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the legislation before us today includes provisions not included in Representative Smith's legislation from last session and to which he is currently opposed, I certainly want to commend Representative Smith for his leadership and dedicated efforts to improve the Freedom of Information Act and to make government more open and accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman Waxman of the full committee and subcommittee Chairman Clay for their efforts in moving this legislation forward quickly and, as well, recognize Ranking Member Davis of the full committee and Ranking Member Turner at the subcommittee for their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is about open and accountable government. I urge a "yes" vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working together on this bill to open up our government to the people of the United States. And I also want to thank Mr. Smith, who has reservations about the bill, but I want to thank him for his leadership in championing the cause of freedom of information in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to also thank my friend from Wisconsin for agreeing with us that the bill was modified since it came out of committee, and that modification was in order to eliminate the costs associated with the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> champions the values of transparency and open government that we celebrate during Sunshine Week and that are embodied in the Freedom of Information Act. The bill does several things: It would reestablish the policy of previous administrations under which agencies were directed to disclose requested information unless the disclosure could result in harm. In addition, the bill proposes a government-wide ombudsman to mediate disputes between agencies and requesters. This  would help to reduce the number of disputes resolved through costly and time-consuming litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does several other things: There is a requirement that agencies respond to FOIA requests within 20 business days or face meaningful administrative penalties. It establishes a publicly accessible tracking system for pending FOIA requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> provides a strong, reasonable, and bipartisan approach to streamlining FOIA and increasing transparency in government. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho and a member of our subcommittee (Mr. Sali).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today because of my serious concerns with section 4 of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I begin, let me emphasize that I support the intent of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>. Transparency in government is an important priority. I campaigned on it and voted for the new ethics package that came before this House in early January with the hope that Congress might be more openly accountable to those who elected us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a government of, by, and for the people, and the people deserve to know what their government is doing. Except for critical issues of national security policy, there must be a much better level of openness in the conduct of the Federal Government and the access of the American people to information about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, section 4 of the bill before us, as it is currently drafted, appears to authorize Federal courts to award attorneys' fees to a plaintiff even when the opposing parties mutually reach and execute a settlement agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The policy of FOIA is, and should be, to expedite and streamline production of documents falling within the statute. My concern is that when a Federal statute provides attorneys' fees after the parties mutually reach a voluntary settlement, it runs contrary to that very goal. Resolution short of protracted litigation should be encouraged, not discouraged. The current proposed language of section 4 of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> may have a devastating, perverse effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the statute may further allow plaintiffs to receive attorneys' fees in almost any case they file so long as they can show that the defending government agency, for any reason, changed its position once the case had been commenced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is true that FOIA complainants often face an uphill battle when they deal with a Federal agency, the language, as proposed, invites litigation instead of resolving it. Additionally, the legislation, as drafted, may actually undermine the stated "dominant objective" of the act by giving an incentive by Federal Departments to avoid disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question this raises in my mind, Mr. Speaker, is that given the provisions of section 4 of the bill, why would any agency settle? As I read the bill, once a lawsuit is commenced, any change in position by a Federal Department or agency would be tantamount to an admission of liability for attorneys' fees. This would only encourage the filing of a myriad of lawsuits. If lawyers know they will make money no matter what the outcome, they will see this as a great opportunity to file, file, and  file again. We will likely see a cottage industry for litigants who may not even care about the underlying documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the concerns I have that the current proposal provides incentives to prolong litigation, I cannot support this measure in its current form. I regret that because I want to vote for any bill that prudently opens the door of government to those whom government represents, our fellow citizens. But the law of unintended consequences is at play here, and unless we strike section 4, we will see massive new litigation that will only clog the Federal docket, hamstring legitimate functions  of government, and cost taxpayers potentially untold millions of dollars.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the Chair of our subcommittee, Mr. Clay, for his thoughtful approach to hearings on this matter and his leadership in shepherding this bill. I want to thank Chairman Waxman for his efforts in having a very bipartisan discussion in the committee on the bill. He was very welcoming of the input from all of the committee members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, though, here, right in the middle of Open Government Week, we have the irony that this is not the bill that both of these gentlemen worked so diligently on a bipartisan basis for in the committee and subcommittee. It has been amended, unfortunately, as the other side of the aisle decried, in a back room by Democratic leadership in order to make the bill conform to the rules of the House for it to be able to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the middle of Open Government Week, what does that mean? Well, it means that while we all stand up here and talk about the importance of freedom of information, and freedom of information is important because it gives people the ability to hold their government accountable; but as we all discuss that, we have a bill that is going to be moving forward and come before this House that the members of the committee did not see, the members of the subcommittee did not see, that each of them is going  to have to review and have to have their staff review, that members of the public at large who may have been following this bill in the professional community or average citizens who had an interest in it will go to a Web site and look at a bill that was approved by the committee and approved by the subcommittee, but unfortunately, is not the bill that is before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is not before us because in the middle of Open Government Week, the bill that was placed before us was amended without the participation of the committee, without the participation of the subcommittee, and without the participation of this body. We will all come to vote on a bill that has been amended in a back room by Democratic leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have heard that there are a number of concerns that people on this side of the aisle have about the bill. As you are aware, this bill began as a Republican bill offered by Mr. Smith of Texas, <bill type="h" number="867">H.R. 867</bill>. It has been modified in several ways about which individuals do have concern. But the underlying principle, freedom of information, that encourages effective government and encourages government to be responsive, is one that we all support and hold dear and certainly we should continue  to support the Freedom of Information Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Sp eaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>, the "Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007." This legislation contains a dozen substantive provisions that will increase public access to Government information by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the principles embodied by FOIA are intended to make the Government, in President Lyndon B. Johnson's words, "as open as the security of the Nation permits." But in recent years, Federal agencies have come to look on FOIA requests as something to be prevented and obstructed, rather than welcomed and facilitated. The bill before us will help end that way of doing business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> restores the presumption of disclosure to FOIA by making it clear that records should be released to the public if disclosure is allowable under law and the agency cannot reasonably foresee any harm from such a disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, under current law, agencies are required to respond to a request for information filed under the FOIA within 20 days but as we all know, delays and backlogs are all too common. <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> makes this deadline meaningful by ensuring that the 20-day statutory clock runs immediately upon an agency's receipt of a request. The bill imposes consequences on Federal agencies for missing the deadline. For example, agencies are prevented from charging processing fees whenever they failed to  meet the 20-working day response deadline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also requires agencies to provide requesters individualized tracking numbers for each request and access to a telephone or internet hotline with information about the status of requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important feature of the bill is that it strengthens agency reporting requirements to identify excessive delays and requires each agency to make the raw data used to compile its annual reports publicly available. Also, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report annually on the Department of Homeland Security's use of the broad disclosure exemption for "critical infrastructure information."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend to Members another feature of <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> that should reduce the need to resort to litigation. The bill creates the new position of FOIA Ombudsman to help FOIA requesters resolve problems without having to turn to the courts. The FOIA ombudsman will be located at the National Archives and will help requesters by providing informal guidance and nonbinding opinions regarding rejected or delayed FOIA requests. The FOIA ombudsman will also review agency compliance with FOIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> makes it more feasible for  citizen groups to challenge the improper withholding of Government information by expanding access to attorneys' fees for FOIA requesters who successfully challenge  an agency's denial of information. The bill also holds agencies accountable for their decisions by enhancing the authority of the Office of Special Counsel to take disciplinary action against Government officials who arbitrarily and  capriciously deny disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> and urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation that will restore public confidence in the administration of the executive branch of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, which will increase the transparency and accountability of the Federal Government by making a number of long-overdue revisions to the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will reemphasize that disclosure is to be the rule, secrecy the exception. It will help people seeking documents to get timely responses, and improve transparency in agency compliance. It will reduce the need for people seeking documents to go to court, and provide accountability for agency decisions on whether to release requested information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the enactment of FOIA in 1966 was a watershed. It established as fundamental policy the principle that information within the government's control should be available and established a presumptive right for the public to obtain identifiable, existing records of Federal agencies. Anyone can use FOIA to request access to Government information. Requesters do not have to show a need or reason for seeking information, and the burden of proof for withholding requested material rests with  the department or agency that seeks to deny the request. Agencies may deny access only to records, or portions of records, that fall within certain specific categories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FOIA has been used effectively by journalists, public interest organizations, corporations, and individuals to access Government information. But the process could be better--because of delays and backlogs, requesters often have found it hard to learn about the status of their requests, and a recent Supreme Court decision has hampered requesters' ability to litigate their claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> would address these and other concerns about the implementation of FOIA. It is a modest measure, but an important one that deserves the approval of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's especially true because, as the Rocky Mountain News noted in a recent editorial, "The Bush administration may have been the most openly contemptuous of FOIA's mission since the act first passed. ..... President Bush will leave office in 2009, but it's not enough to trust that future administrations will abide by the promise of openness that FOIA represents. The law needs specific measures to ensure accountability, and the amendments within <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> mark a large stride forward."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the information of our colleagues, I attach the complete text of that editorial:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Open Records Upgrade</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We welcome bipartisan efforts in Congress to beef up the Freedom of Information Act--the four-decade-old law that affords citizens access to the inner workings of the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FOIA could certainly stand a little love, as open Government has been attacked many times since Lyndon Johnson signed the act into law July 4, 1966.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revisions to FOIA in <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>, which could come before the full House as early as today, would both shine more light on the nooks and crannies of federal bureaucracies and force agencies to better respect the spirit of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are a few of the improvements:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government would have to act on FOIA requests more quickly. Agencies that did not respond to a request within 20 business days would forfeit any copying and research fees; agencies are now supposed to respond within that period, but there are no penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal departments would have to set up FOIA hotlines and individual tracking numbers so that people and organizations that file FOIA requests can easily follow the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizen journalists and freelancers would gain new credibility. An agency could no longer summarily deny FOIA requests from journalists who are not employed or under contract with established media organizations or watchdog groups. Such requests from unaffiliated individuals can now be rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amended law would force agencies to consider any request to disseminate information to a broad audience as legitimate, particularly if the party making the request has any record of publication (including bloggers).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government would have to reimburse the legal fees of more parties that sue under FOIA. Currently, there's only one way a party that has filed suit to enforce a FOIA request can get repaid: The Government has to lose in court. The amendments would force agencies to repay attorney fees if the government turns over records before a final ruling is issued. This would prevent agencies from sticking media groups with attorney fees by surrendering records just before a judge rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration may have been the most openly contemptuous of FOIA's mission since the act first passed. Former Attorney General John Ashcroft urged Federal agencies to fight FOIA requests and not presume that the public has a right to know what goes on inside the executive branch. The administration also placed gratuitous limits on requests to the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush will leave office in 2009, but it's not enough to trust that future administrations will abide by the promise of openness that FOIA represents. The law needs specific measures to ensure accountability, and the amendments within <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill> mark a large stride forward.</paragraph>
