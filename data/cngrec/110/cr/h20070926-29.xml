    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have lost a popular and well-educated school administrator who was an outstanding student and gifted in music. Early on, her teachers would say of her, "She could walk amongst kings and not lose her common touch." She moved easily among people, singing her way into star status, and even appeared on an early TV version of "Star Search." Using her own talents of fashion, decorating and cooking, she was a role model for her students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Kaufman was a special education administrative secretary for Los Angeles County Schools for over 25 years. She was a champion for the rights of children with special needs and deeply loved working in her chosen profession. In addition, Barbara volunteered in the political campaigns of myself, and she accepted any job that would add to the improvement of the people's social, political and economic conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After many bouts with illness, Barbara's activities were limited. However, she participated as much as possible in her church, particularly enjoying Bible study and prayer support groups. Barbara Kaufman was a woman for all seasons and a witness for Christ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A life so well lived has to be recognized by our Congress so the record will show her life as a role model for others. BJ's star will forever shine in the lives of those who knew and loved her.</paragraph>
