  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Since it was established by Congress in 1962 at the request of President John F. Kennedy, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has achieved an outstanding record of achievement in catalyzing a concentrated attack on the unsolved health problems of children and of mother-infant relationships by fulfilling its mission to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) ensure that every individual is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all individuals through optimal rehabilitation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has made unparalleled contributions to the advancement of child health and human development, including significant efforts to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV transmission;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) vaccine, credited with nearly eliminating the incidence of mental retardation; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) conduct intramural research, support extramural research, and train thousands of child health and human development researchers who have contributed greatly to dramatic gains in child health throughout the world.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The vision, drive, and tenacity of one woman, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, was instrumental in proposing, passing, and enacting legislation to establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (Public Law 87-838) on October 17, 1962.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) It is befitting and appropriate to recognize the substantial achievements of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless advocate for children with special needs, whose foresight in creating the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development gave life to the words of President Kennedy, who wished to "encourage imaginative research into the complex processes of human development from conception to old age.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the Senate bill now under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to express my strong support for <bill type="s" number="2484">S. 2484</bill>, a bill to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. I am proud to lend my support to a bill aimed at honoring such a compassionate and wonderful human being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often we miss out on the opportunity to honor people while they are with us. Today, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join with me in seizing the moment and commemorating Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless advocate for children. While Eunice Kennedy Shriver is perhaps best known for her efforts on behalf of those affected by mental retardation and for the creation of the Special Olympics, she has also been a leader on many other fronts. In particular, it is wholly appropriate  that we name the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development after Eunice Kennedy Shriver, as she was instrumental in establishing the institute just over 45 years ago during the administration of her brother, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the nearly half a century since its founding, the institute has helped make great strides in the advancement of child health and human development, including dramatically reducing sudden infant death syndrome and infant mortality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the goals of the institute is to ensure that children have the opportunity to reach their full potential and live healthy and productive lives. Her commitment and dedication to helping children meet these goals has been unwavering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is important that we, before it is too late, that we honor this great American, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, today by renaming the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development after her. I support this good bill and urge all of my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise in support of Senate 2484, an act to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Shriver, along with her husband Sargent, was and is a champion for young people who suffer and strive under the extra load of developmental disabilities. Prior to the creation of the NICHD more than 40 years ago, many scientists were of the mind that money would be better off spent studying adult diseases, effectively shortchanging the younger populations with these conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NICHD was established in 1962 under the Kennedy administration and many credit Ms. Shriver's tenacity. Ms. Shriver never stopped being a spokesperson and advocate, and the institute she helped found has never stopped benefiting from her determination and her spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to confer with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to determine if it is their understanding as well that nothing in this bill will change any of the authorities that the NIH Reform Act of 2006 provided the NIH and the director of the NIH. Specifically, nothing in this act will change any authorities of the Scientific Management Review Board or any other provisions provided in section 401 of that act. Is that your understanding as well?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry). You are absolutely correct. This legislation is only meant to change the name of the single institute within NIH and to have no other effect, no other effect on the NIH or its organization. We do not intend to change or even signal any other change at the NIH.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill, <bill type="s" number="2484">S. 2484</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
