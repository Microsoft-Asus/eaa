    <paragraph>I will only additionally call to the Senate's attention that with my colleague, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, we engaged in a friendly wager. This is not like the normal wager that years ago, when a Florida team was playing a California team and the junior Senator from California, Senator Boxer, and I entered into a friendly wager of a crate of oranges versus a barrel of California almonds--and our office enjoyed those almonds for several months. No, this was a different kind. This  was a wager with Senator Brown of Ohio that the losing team's Senator would do the number of military pushups equivalent to the score of the game in public in front of the cameras. So with a score of 41 to 14, that is 55 pushups. I will even extend</paragraph>
