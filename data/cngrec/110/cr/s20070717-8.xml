  <narrative>ORDER OF PROCEDURE -- (Senate - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9294">S9294</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, pursuant to the statement made by the Republican leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn amendment be scheduled for a vote at 2:15 and that it be a majority vote and that Senator McConnell can withdraw his amendment, which is currently pending.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator Cornyn is in a hearing this morning, so we would want to provide a little bit of time for him this afternoon, but I think we should be able to work this out shortly. We would pursue a discussion with the floor staff and see if we can't lock this in. There is no particular reason why we couldn't work this out. For the moment, I object. Maybe the vote could occur at 2:45. Would that be acceptable?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I amend my unanimous consent request to 2:45, with the time equally divided between 2:15 and 2:45, and that the Cornyn amendment will then be called for a vote, with the standard of the majority as to whether it passes or fails.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>And no second-degree amendments, I might add, and the McConnell amendment withdrawn.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, could we state the consent request again?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I can try. It is that the debate will commence at 2:15 on the Cornyn amendment, with the time equally divided for 30 minutes; at 2:45 the Cornyn amendment will be called for consideration--for a vote--with no second-degree amendments; that the vote standard for passage of the Cornyn amendment will be a majority vote; and that Senator McConnell will withdraw his pending amendment. I think that is the sum and substance of it. The McConnell cloture motion would be withdrawn.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
