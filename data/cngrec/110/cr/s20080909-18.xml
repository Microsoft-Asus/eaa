  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak on where America stands in the global war on terror. This week, of course, marks the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on our country. While our allies in Europe have suffered terrible acts of terrorism in subsequent years since September 11, 2001, our Nation has been blessed with no attacks since that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet that single fact should not obscure the reality that America remains dangerously vulnerable to future attacks and that the very policies pursued by President Bush have made our Nation less secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the President announced that he will redeploy 8,000 soldiers out of a total of 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq over the remainder of this year and early next year. The scheduled replacements for those 8,000 forces will instead head to Afghanistan to respond to the sharply deteriorating circumstances there. I am pleased the President has started to come to grips with the severity of the threat we face in Afghanistan and the need to devote more U.S. troops and resources to what remains the central  front in the war on terror. But let's be serious. Shifting 8,000 American troops to Afghanistan is wholly inadequate when we see Taliban extremists using sanctuary bases in Pakistan to increase attacks on U.S. and NATO forces there, when we see the Karzai government struggling to maintain the confidence of the Afghan people, and when we see the Taliban gaining new recruits by the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Against all evidence, President Bush continues to view Iraq as the central front on the war on terror. We have heard him say that over and over again. He refuses to acknowledge al-Qaida established a presence in Iraq only as a by-product of our invasion in 2003. He ignores recent intelligence reports that al-Qaida leaders are sending senior level commanders and new recruits into Afghanistan, not Iraq. President Bush disregards the fact that al-Qaida has reconstituted its global headquarters to  plan future worldwide attacks of terrorism in the frontier regions of Pakistan, ungoverned territories that remain off-limits to Pakistani military. After September 11, 2001, this President vowed al-Qaida would never again enjoy sanctuary to target the American people. Yet we are seeing it happening again before our very eyes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, unfortunately, President Bush will end his Presidency in the same manner he started--with a disastrous miscalculation of the threat posed by al-Qaida and the necessary tools to combat Islamic extremism. When the President took office in January of 2001, he and his senior advisers dismissed the focus on terrorism held by the preceding administration, refusing to believe a superpower such as the United States could be threatened by nonstate actors. That mindset allowed the administration to  ignore repeated warnings by the intelligence community that al-Qaida was preparing for a major attack on the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the 9/11 attacks, the President rightfully moved to topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after they refused to turn over senior al-Qaida leaders. Yet the administration failed to recognize that only a long-term investment of troops, developmental assistance, and economic benefits was essential if Afghanistan was to not once again collapse into a failed state. Instead, the President shifted his focus to Iraq, redeploying such critical  assets  as Special Forces units and unmanned aircraft to the Persian Gulf to prepare for what was an inevitable war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years later, we are still living with the consequences of this administration's rush to war in Iraq. Afghanistan teeters on collapse, with the drug trade resurgent and Taliban forces controlling more and more territory. Pakistan remains dysfunctional, with a difficult transition of power occurring now and an extremist insurgency taking root in its border regions. Iran has grown immeasurably stronger over the past 5 years, taking advantage of America's inattention to move forward on its nuclear  program and support extremist groups throughout the Middle East. And what we can never forget, the men who perpetrated the most deadly attacks on American soil remain free 7 years after the fact. This is not only a slap in the face to the families of the 3,000 Americans murdered on September 11, it remains a continuing danger as al-Qaida plots new attacks on our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his speech today at the National Defense University, the President made the following assertion:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, with our allies, we made substantial progress towards breaking up terrorist networks--and we will not rest until they are destroyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard similar statements from President Bush and senior administration officials dating back to 2002--that America is taking the fight to al-Qaida and winning the war on terrorism. The only problem is the administration has never defined what victory means nor provided a set of benchmarks to allow the American people to judge whether we are making real progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that reason, I am joined today by Senator Hagel in introducing an amendment to the Defense authorization bill to require the executive branch to produce, on a semiannual basis, a comprehensive report on the status of our Nation's efforts and the level of resulting progress to defeat al-Qaida and related affiliates in the global war on terrorism. The Congress receives numerous reports on the status of our efforts in individual theaters, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, but we have never  received a basic update from the administration on what the United States is doing to ensure that al-Qaida never again succeeds in launching the type of devastating attacks such as those we suffered 7 years ago this week. This amendment, if adopted, would allow the Congress and the American people to hold administration officials--this or future administration officials--accountable when they claim we are winning against al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me briefly conclude by returning to a topic on which I have spoken previously on this floor--the danger of nuclear terrorism. Tomorrow, a high-level panel convened by the Partnership for a Secure America, consisting of some of the men and women who served on the 9/11 Commission, will release a report card on America's efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and prevent a catastrophic act of terrorism involving such weapons on American soil. Press reports indicate  the final grades will not be good. Our Government will receive an overall grade of C, with sharp criticism focused on our lack of a coherent governmentwide strategy, our acute vulnerability to an act of bioterrorism, and our continuing failure to secure loose fissile materials and nuclear stockpiles around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years ago, this President declared in a campaign debate that he agreed with his opponent that the prospect of a nuclear weapon destroying an American city is the single greatest threat to U.S. national security. Yet while there have been useful efforts in recent years, it remains clear the U.S. Government has not marshaled all of its resources to combat this threat. For instance, we have spent more funds securing our aviation system against another hijacking than preventing a future act  of nuclear terrorism. However, I fear when al-Qaida strikes our Nation the next time, they will not be using their old playbook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America stands today less secure than it should be. Our massive military presence in Iraq, now approaching its seventh year, has strained our most precious resources--our men and women in uniform. It has reduced our flexibility to respond to various other threats throughout the world, including Russia's recent military incursion into Georgia, and emboldened other enemies--Iran most notably. We have failed to finish the job we started in Afghanistan. For too long, we tolerated a dictator in Pakistan  on the basis that he was best equipped to serve as an ally in the war on terrorism, only to find out al-Qaida had reconstituted its central headquarters in that very nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and those who seek to continue his policies indefinitely will make speeches all week long that we are winning the war on terror. But they make those statements in direct contradiction to the assessments of our intelligence community, and they fail to offer the evidence to back up their assertions. Enough is enough. We cannot afford to continue the same misguided policies that have made America less safe for another 4 years.</paragraph>
