  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Jos&amp;#233; Compean turned themselves in to begin serving their 11- and 12-year prison terms. Now, what was their crime? Shooting a habitual drug smuggler after he evaded law enforcement, attacked one of the agents and threateningly turned to the agent with what appeared to be a gun, and was fleeing back across the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, how is this justice, Mr. Speaker?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Kanof even went to Mexico to find this drug dealer, brought him to America, paid for his medical treatment in an El Paso hospital with taxpayers' dollars and gave him immunity to testify against the agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unreasonable sentence of these agents undermines the morale and makes all of them question what they are doing, do they have the right to draw their firearm in the course of their duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an outrage. I urge President Bush to review this draconian prison sentence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
