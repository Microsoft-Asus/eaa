    <paragraph>Madam President, the Senate just entered into an agreement which establishes parameters for the final debate on the nomination of General Casey. The vote on confirmation will occur around 11:30 a.m. tomorrow. We don't know the exact time because it is according to how much time is used by the leaders, and other matters may get in the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After we dispose of that nomination, the Senate will begin consideration of the continuing funding resolution. As I indicated, the Republican leader and I have had discussions about this CR, and we will continue to have discussions as we move forward with this most important legislation.</paragraph>
