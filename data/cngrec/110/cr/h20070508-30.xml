  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, did you know that the Nation's border agents have no confidence in their top chief? These men and women are on the front lines of illegal immigration. They want, need, and deserve strong leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing the country's 11,000 nonsupervisory border agents, announced it had cast a unanimous no-confidence vote in U.S. Border  Patrol Chief David Aguilar. The vote comes as two border agents sit in jail for doing their jobs, combating illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are as outraged as I am about the unjust persecution of law enforcement agents, go to pardontheagents.com and sign an on-line petition urging President Bush to pardon Agents Ramos and Compean.</paragraph>
