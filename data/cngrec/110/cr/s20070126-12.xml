    <paragraph>Mr. President, in terms of the process by which we go forward next week to discuss the Iraq situation, as the majority leader indicated, we have been in discussions over the last couple of days about how that might go forward. We are still in the process of consulting with our Members. I have indicated to the majority leader that there is likely to be one or more additional resolutions offered by this side, and as we begin the week, I will have a clearer picture of just  how many that might be, and then we can begin to sit down and structure the process by which those will be considered in the Senate. I look forward to working with the majority leader next week in that regard.</paragraph>
