    <paragraph>Mr. President, on another issue, Senator Bond reports that the FISA discussions have yielded a rough compromise that may be acceptable to the DNI, the White House, and the chairs and ranking members of the Intelligence Committees. Because the House leadership has denied a majority of House Members a vote on the acceptable Senate-passed bill last year, the burden remains on House leaders to prove they are capable of passing FISA legislation that the President will  sign.</paragraph>
