  <narrative>APOLOGIES TO DAWN DAWSON -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13389]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to apologize to Dawn Dawson. Ms. Dawson is a thoughtful young woman who was engaged in a lawsuit involving a charge of discrimination based on sexual orientation. An organization in the dispute we had about the scope of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, in my judgment, misquoted the holding in that lawsuit. In the course of refuting that, I quoted some passages which reflected somewhat negatively on Ms. Dawson. I should not have done that.  There is no reason to make any negative inference about her. It was in a legal context which does not support factually any negative response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Dawson called me after that, came to see me. I was impressed by her grace, by her thoughtfulness, and by her commitment to working for a better America for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to express my regret that I brought this young woman into this dispute for no good reason. She deserves much better from me, as she deserves from all who are concerned about fairness in this country. And as I said, I apologize to Ms. Dawson. I continue to believe that the organization with which I was disputing misinterpreted her lawsuit, but that was not her fault.</paragraph>
