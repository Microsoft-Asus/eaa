  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="Introducing S. 1693. A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable health information technology system and to improve the quality and reduce the costs of health care in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1693">S. 1693</bill>] Mr. President, it is long past time for the Nation's health care industry to adopt modern information technology. Such technology has revolutionized a wide array of American industries, and it holds the same promise for the health care industry. It has a clear capacity to increase efficiency and reduce costs at a time when the industry is being plagued by the alarming rise in health costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staggering inefficiencies imbedded in our health care system prevent patients across the country from receiving the type of care they deserve. Forty percent of Americans have been victims of preventable medical errors, and as many as 100,000 patients die each year from such errors. In a Nation which already spends more on health care than any other country, a modest investment in health IT is a small price to pay for a safer and less costly health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some health facilities with resources at their disposal have already invested in IT systems with great success. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable institutions lag further and further behind in the adoption of necessary technology. It now costs a physician's office about $40,000 to implement a new IT system. Providers with financial need deserve access to information technology to close the health IT gap, so that patients across the country have access to quality health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate unanimously approved the Wired for Health Care Quality Act in the last Congress. Today, Senator Enzi, Senator Hatch, Senator Clinton, and I are reintroducing that bill, and we urge its swift passage. By setting national standards for health information technology and by offering funds for IT investment, the legislation will help providers overcome both the technical and the financial barriers to adopting and implementing health IT systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the financial challenges of such investments, our bill establishes several Federal funding mechanisms to encourage the adoption of this technology. The legislation authorizes Federal grants for providers in need and funds low interest loans in order to ease the burden on health care professionals who invest in new systems for electronic medical records and other purposes. Since the ability of physicians to share information is essential to ensuring effective treatment and eliminating  wasteful spending, our bill also provides financial assistance to establish regional and local health IT networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rapid exchange of information is essential to ensuring that providers have complete patient information, but the adoption of such technology must be accompanied by strong patient privacy protection. Our bill specifies that the American Health Information Community will be a body to make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on patient privacy, information security, and appropriate uses of the technology. In addition, the bill ensures that freestanding health information  databases are subject to the same privacy rules as other health care entities and requires grant recipients to implement strong privacy protections themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To encourage the implementation of modern health information systems across the Nation, the legislation codifies the role of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate and expedite the adoption of health IT by Federal agencies. In addition, the bill establishes a public-private partnership, the Partnership for Health Care Improvement, to streamline the nationwide implementation of health information systems by establishing  standards for interoperability that must be adopted by grant recipients and Federal contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Estimates indicate that the widespread adoption of electronic health records could save up to 30 percent in annual health spending, or more than $600 billion a year. Since 45 million Americans are uninsured, we can't delay the nationwide adoption of health IT systems any longer. Interoperability standards will eliminate inefficiencies caused by lack of uniform technology. Increased funding will reduce the widening health IT gap, making the advances of the information age available to all health  facilities. The savings generated by these initiatives have the potential to give all Americans access to the Nation's state-of-the-art health care industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially commend the work of my colleagues Senator Enzi, Senator Clinton, and Senator Hatch in developing this needed legislation, and I look forward to its enactment as soon as possible.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="Introducing S. 1693. A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable health information technology system and to improve the quality and reduce the costs of health care in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my commitment to improve the quality and reduce the cost of health care in this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the most serious challenges facing health care today, medical errors, inconsistent quality, and rising costs, can be addressed through the effective application of available health information technology linking all elements of the health care system. Information sharing networks have the potential to enable decision support anywhere at any time, thus improving the quality of health care and reducing costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what does this mean for patients? Well, first of all, the widespread use of health IT would allow medical data to move with people as they move. When someone goes to the doctor's office, he or she won't have to take the clipboard and write down everything they can remember about themselves. Better use of health IT also would cut down on medical errors with prescriptions, instead of trying to decipher the doctor's handwriting, a pharmacist could access the prescription information electronically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The widespread use of health IT could also save lives. If someone is traveling and gets in a car wreck or gets hurt in some other way, the emergency room doctor would be able to find out everything he or she needs to know to make the right treatment decisions. If someone falls into a coma and can't tell a doctor or nurse about their medications, being able to access an electronic medical record could prevent dangerous drug reactions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond saving lives and saving time, more effective use of health IT also could save us a lot of money. A Rand study suggested that health IT has the potential to save the health care system $162 billion a year. In order for these savings to be realized, we must create an infrastructure for interoperability. The bill I am introducing today is the first step toward building that infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, the Senate unanimously passed the Wired for Health Care Quality Act, which I wrote with Senator KENNEDY. We have worked with Senator HATCH and Senator CLINTON and are introducing an updated bill today. We plan to bring this revised bill before our committee this Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation addresses one of the primary barriers to widespread adoption of interoperable health IT, which is the lack of agreed-upon standards, common implementation guides, and a certification process. The bill directs the Secretary to establish and chair the public-private American Health Information Collaborative, which is composed of representatives of the public and private sectors. The greatest improvements in quality of health care and cost savings will be realized when all elements  of the health care system are electronically connected and speak a common technical language; that is, they are interoperable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to address the health information technology "adoption gap" in the U.S., the bill authorizes three grant programs that will carefully target financial support to health care providers and consortia for the purpose  of facilitating the adoption of interoperable health information technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another barrier to greater adoption is cultural. I recognize that many physicians and hospitals are hesitant to move from paper-based systems to electronic systems. Some physicians have been writing prescriptions by hand for many years and may resist changing to electronic prescribing. One way to address this cultural barrier is to support teaching hospitals that integrate health information technology in the clinical education of health care professionals. Exposing students and residents to  effective everyday uses of health IT will lead to a greater adoption by these students and residents when they graduate and begin practicing on their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The wise deployment of health IT is also critical for effective response in public health emergencies. Interoperable health IT systems will help to track infectious disease outbreaks and increase the Federal Government's rapid response in emergency situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am eager to work with members of the Finance Committee to ensure we produce a bill that will pass the Senate unanimously once again this Congress. This bill ensures that avenues to measure and report the quality of care are available through health information technology. Improving the quality of care provided in this country is one of my top legislative priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to passing this important legislation, which will help facilitate the widespread adoption of electronic health records to ultimately result in fewer mistakes, lower costs, better care, and greater patient participation in their health and well being. This is a great stride forward in the journey to improve our Nation's health care system. I look forward to seeing meaningful health information technology legislation signed into law this Congress.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="Introducing S. 1693. A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable health information technology system and to improve the quality and reduce the costs of health care in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, for several years now I have been promoting the adoption of health information technology as a means to improve our health care system. Modernizing our system will improve quality of care and reduce costs. A RAND study found that, as a nation, we could save more than $77 billion annually through the widespread use of electronic medical records, and these savings could double with the addition of prevention and chronic disease management components.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced comprehensive health quality and IT legislation in 2003 to set us on the path to creating a health IT infrastructure. Subsequently, the Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation that I worked on with Senators Frist, Kennedy, and Enzi. We were unable to reach final agreement on that bill before the adjournment of the 109th Congress and today are reintroducing the Wired for Healthcare Quality Act to bring our health care system into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to be working again on this critical effort with Senators Kennedy and Enzi and want to welcome Senator Hatch and thank him for his work and contributions to the bill we are introducing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are a number of things I believe we need to do to improve our health care system, one of the most fundamental avenues for change is modernizing our system of care by developing a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure that protects patient privacy. It is past time that our health care delivery system allow providers to easily manage their information needs and securely and privately manage the needs of their patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the most advanced medical system in the world, yet patient safety and quality is compromised because health care providers are treating patients without all the information they need. It happens in the emergency room or when you are seeing multiple doctors who are unaware of treatments you are receiving from others. Harnessing the potential of information technology will eliminate these problems and help reduce errors and improve quality in our health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interoperable health IT will also help eliminate inefficiency and duplication in the system. Every time patients see a doctor, they fill out forms, have to remember their medical history, their medications, immunizations, and previous test results. No wonder a study in California found that one out of every five lab tests and x rays were conducted solely because previous lab results were unavailable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason why people's health files--their medical history, test results, lab records, x rays--can't be accessed securely and confidentially from a doctor's office or hospital. In fact, if all hospitals used a computerized physician order entry system, an estimated 200,000 fewer adverse drug events would occur, saving roughly $1 billion per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also eliminate administrative inefficiencies that drive up health care costs. Today, processing paper claims costs an average of $1.60 to $2.20 per claim. It costs 85 cents for an electronic claim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can also use information technology to disseminate clinical research. A government study recently showed it takes 17 years from the time of a new medical discovery to the time clinicians actually incorporate that discovery into their practice at the bedside. Health IT will dramatically reduce this time and help drive improvements in care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act is designed to address these issues through Federal leadership to develop and adopt the technology standards necessary to ensure that electronic medical records are fully portable and confidential for patients and accessible to their health care providers. The legislation encourages the development of a private and secure nationwide interoperable health IT infrastructure through:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Codifying the role of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in coordinating the policies of federal agencies regarding health IT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing a public-private partnership known as the Partnership for Health Care Improvement to provide recommendations to the Secretary with regard to technical aspects of interoperability, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for the exchange of health information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring all Federal IT purchases to conform to the standards recommended by the Partnership and adopted by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing the American Health Information Community as a body providing recommendations to the Secretary regarding policies to promote the development of a nationwide interoperable health information technology infrastructure. These include recommendations regarding patient privacy, information security, and appropriate uses of health information. A wide variety of stakeholders including patients, providers, insurers, employers, and experts in information technology, privacy, security, and  quality--will have representation on the AHIC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing three competitive grant programs for the adoption and increased utilization of qualified health information technology systems. The first grant program would award funding to eligible entities, including nonprofit hospitals, community health centers, and small physician practices to purchase, train, and use qualified health information technology systems and improve the management of chronic diseases. The second grant program would award funding to States to establish loan funds  for the purchase of qualified systems, and the final competitive grant program would assist with the establishment of regional or local health information technology exchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring privacy and security by delineating the rights of individuals to inspect and correct their records and take action to address fraud, as well as requiring breach notification and audit trails so patients can know who has accessed their information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing a Health Information Technology Resource Center to provide technical assistance and highlight best practices associated with the adoption, implementation and effective use of health information technology systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased by the focus that this legislation places on ensuring that information technology will improve the quality of care delivered in our Nation. The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act will prioritize quality through the following provisions: Developing quality and efficiency reports at the national, regional, and, when requested, institutional or individual  provider level, that will help to improve quality and efficiency and enhance  the ability of consumers to evaluate the quality and delivery of healthcare services; Establishing a process through which to develop evidence-based, consensus health care quality measures, through which to determine the quality and efficiency of care received</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Information technology has radically changed business and other aspects of American life. It is time we use the power of the information age to improve health care. If we do, we can dramatically improve the quality of care we all receive. The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act is critical to this effort. Again I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Enzi and Hatch for their partnership on this legislation, and I look forward to working with them and all of my colleagues  to enact this important bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="Introducing S. 1693. A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable health information technology system and to improve the quality and reduce the costs of health care in the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of <bill type="s" number="1693">S. 1693</bill>, the Wired for Healthcare Quality Act. The goal of achieving high quality health care is not reachable without use of information technology. For instance, the 21 quality measures that hospitals now report for Medicare must usually be manually extracted from paper charts. The Government Accountability Office reports that hospitals are near the limit of the number of quality measures that they can report by these antiquated  techniques. Implementation of information technology is critical because with it there is no practical limit on the ability to measure quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Brent James, a national quality expert from Intermountain Healthcare of Salt Lake City, UT, tells me that a health care provider who wishes to improve performance starts by defining detailed measures of quality health care and then builds information technology around the measures so that routine, automatic reporting of compliance with the measures becomes part of the health information technology platform. The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act does not just impose standards for interoperability  of information technology it creates a mechanism by which quality measures are embedded in those standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation encourages the development of standards by codifying the office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology who coordinates the health information technology policies of Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It creates a public-private partnership, the Partnership for Health Care Improvement to advise the Secretary on technical aspects of interoperability, on standards, on implementation, and on certification of compliance with those standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill establishes the American Health Information Community as a body providing recommendations to the Secretary regarding the broad policy issues of implementation of technical standards created by the partnership. For instance, it will advise the Secretary on issues of patient privacy, information security, and appropriate uses of health information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill directs the Secretary to provide for the development and use of quality measures in the health information technology platform by an arrangement with a private entity that establishes standards for measurement development and coordinates and harmonizes measures so that providers are able to use the same set of measures, if not the same measures, for all their patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation requires that all Federal information technology purchases conform to the standards recommended by the Partnership and adopted by the President within 1 year and that all Federal agencies comply within 3 years. Adoption of these standards is voluntary for private entities except for functions they contract with the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation encourages the adoption of qualified health information technology by providing grants for the purchase of health information technology systems to providers demonstrating financial needs, by providing low interest loans to states to help providers acquire health information technology systems, and by providing grants to facilitate the implementation of regional or local health information exchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation provides for the development of national reports of health care quality based on Federal health care data and private data that is publicly available. Reports are to be contracted to quality reporting organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation assures strong privacy protections for electronic health information by forbidding funding under the bill to any information technology system that lacks strong privacy and security protections, by requiring recipients of funding to notify patients if their medical information is wrongfully disclosed and by requiring that the national strategy on health information technology include strong privacy protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, I must raise a concern with the bill. Building a national, interoperable health care information technology platform is like building two houses with a common driveway. Federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are one house. Private health plans are the other. They both must share common standards for health information technology so that systems all talk with one another. They both must implement from a common pool of quality standards otherwise providers will be impossibly  confused. The two houses will not look alike but they must share a common driveway and common building standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I use this analogy to emphasize that the rules for the quality measures used by the Medicare Program are the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee on which I serve as a senior member. The rules for quality measures in a national health information technology standard, and private health insurance plans, are under the jurisdiction of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. We must be certain that these distinctions are made with clarity to avoid confusing ourselves and the  medical community. I look forward to working with Senators Enzi, Kennedy, and Clinton, and my colleagues Chairman Max Baucus and Ranking Minority Member Chuck Grassley on the Finance Committee to ensure that these important distinctions are made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do not accomplish the task of integrating quality and health information technology standards between public and private programs, providers will be placed in the impossible position of having one set of quality and information technology standards for publicly insured patients and other requirements for privately insured patients. If such a Tower of Babel is allowed to develop, providers will simply not be able to implement the improvements in care that we all want to see through the use  of health information technology. We cannot miss this chance.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300081" topic="Introducing S. 1699. A bill to amend the provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 regarding school library media specialists, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1699">S. 1699</bill>] Mr. President, today I am joined by Mr. Cochran in introducing important legislation, the Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries, SKILLs, Act, to support our Nation's school libraries and librarians. This legislation is also being introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Grijalva and Representative Ehlers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SKILLs Act enhances the value of school libraries by reauthorizing and strengthening the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program of the No Child Left Behind Act. The Department of Education found that the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program is successful in improving the quality of school libraries receiving grants and school libraries are a critical component in improving student literacy skills and academic achievement by giving students access to up-to-date  library materials, including well-equipped and technologically advanced school library media centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SKILLs Act seeks to build on this success in several ways. It ensures that funds serve elementary, middle, and high school students. It encourages the hiring of highly qualified school library media specialists in our Nation's  school libraries. Additionally, it expands professional development to include information literacy instruction appropriate for all grade levels, an assessment of student literacy needs, the coordination of reading and writing  instruction across content areas, and training in literacy strategies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's librarians do so much more than catalogue collections and check out books, they are educators in every sense of the word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They provide tech support, guidance, and social services to patrons in need. They help teach our children how to safely and effectively navigate electronic media like the Internet and help instill a love of learning and reading in young students. In short, school libraries and librarians play an essential role in helping students get the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive world and this legislation provide the necessary support for that endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
