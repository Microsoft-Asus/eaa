    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it seems like Indiana Jones is at it again. This time the search is on for the secret underground tunnels of Egypt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Army in Texas is training Egyptian soldiers to locate and destroy underground tunnels used by criminals to smuggle arms from Egypt into the Gaza Strip. Our troops are out there teaching digging techniques to the Egyptians looking for the lost treasure tunnels of guns and rockets. We are doing this to help protect the borders of Israel and Egypt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the U.S.-Mexican border is still porous for underground smuggling. Since 9/11, more than 40 smuggling tunnels from Mexico to the United States have been discovered. Last year, the DEA located a high-tech, sophisticated concrete tunnel 85 feet underground filled with two tons of drugs. Law enforcement expects there to be more tunnels found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than just protecting the borders of other nations by training Egyptian tunnel raiders, maybe we ought to send the military to protect our own southern border from the underground secret tunnel invasion of guns, drugs and people coming into the United States without permission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
