    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier this year the Senate worked together to change the way we appropriate money in Congress. One of the big showdowns that we had earlier in the year with the new majority was the discussion of earmarks and how we would disclose them and be more transparent to the American people. We worked hard. I introduced an amendment that would provide disclosure at the committee level and asked that the committee put any earmarks on the Internet and tell who offered  the earmark and what it would go for, to make sure there is no conflict of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally, the majority tried to table that motion, but once we worked together on language and worked out every detail, that amendment was agreed to 98 to 0. It was unanimous that we should stop earmarking the way we are today and use commonsense disclosure rules for America to know how we are spending its money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that amendment is part of the lobbying reform, ethics reform bill that has gone to conference with the House that apparently is not going to act on it at all. My proposal has been that we take what we passed in the Senate. We are beginning the appropriations process again. Unless we impose these rules on ourselves, rules that we all agreed on, we are going to go through the same thing we did last year where we put all these bills together, with thousands of earmarks, and at the  end of the year some of us are going to be forced to try to stop the whole process, which, hopefully, we will not do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I would like to do today to fix this problem is take the amendment we have passed unanimously before and bring it up and pass it in the Senate as a Senate rule so we would operate under the rules that we have all agreed to during this appropriations season. The resolution number is 123, so fixing the current appropriations problem and earmark problem is as easy as 1, 2, 3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Rules Committee be discharged from further consideration, and the Senate now proceed to <bill type="sr" number="123">S. Res. 123</bill>; further, that the resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection? The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>I believe there is an appropriate process to consider the Senator's request, but at this time I object.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am certainly disappointed. This is something to which we have agreed. We worked out the language with the majority. Certainly, we should be operating under the rules that we have agreed to during this appropriations season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very unfortunate. I am very disappointed. I guess I have no choice, if the majority is going to object.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.</chair>
