    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="519">H. Res. 519</bill>, a bill that honors the life and accomplishments of renowned artist Tom Lea on the 100th anniversary of his birth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="519">H. Res. 519</bill>, which has 79 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Silvestre Reyes on June 26, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="519">H. Res. 519</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 19, 2007, by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Silvestre Reyes, for seeking to honor the life and accomplishments of renowned artist Tom Lea, and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Tom Lea, I ask Members to join me in honoring the life and accomplishments of this remarkable American. Tom Lea was a painter, muralist, illustrator, writer and war correspondent, whose work continues to captivate and inspire us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in El Paso, Texas, in 1907, he showed an early talent for art and left home to study at the Art Institute of Chicago. While this began a pattern of world travel he continued throughout his life, Tom Lea's home was always Texas and the American Southwest. His paintings capture the spirit of the West and show a vibrant life that thrives in seemingly barren land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lea put his education to good use as a muralist for the Works Progress Administration. His works include the award winning "The Nesters," which adorns the Post Office Department Building here in Washington, and the portrait of Sam Rayburn on display in the Rayburn House Office Building, and I think on display right now in this Chamber. Additionally, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, numerous public buildings in Missouri, and educational and government facilities throughout Texas exhibit  his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1942, Time magazine hired Lea to cover the war in the Pacific. Finding paint inadequate to capture the full story, Lea began his career as a novelist while on assignment. He continued writing after the war, and published six works of fiction and nonfiction, including a two-volume annotated history of the King Ranch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fans of his work are numerous and include President George W. Bush, who honored Lea by using a quote from an autobiography while accepting the Republican nomination for President in 2000. Shortly before his death in January of 2001, Lea had the great satisfaction of delivering one of his paintings, "Rio Grande," to the President, so he could hang it in the Oval Office. The painting remains there today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to great critical acclaim, Lea's lifetime of work has earned him the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the United States Marine Corps Colonel John W. Thomason, Jr., Award, and the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum's Great Westerners Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, let us show our respect and gratitude for this great American by passing <bill type="hr" number="519">H. Res. 519</bill> to honor the life and accomplishments of Tom Lea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), the sponsor of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a representative of the 16th District of Texas, I rise today in honor of a great El Pasoan and a great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have on the floor beside me two pictures of paintings by this great American. His name is Tom Lea. He hails from my district of El Paso, Texas, and has left a lasting impression on the Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of these paintings, "Rio Grande," this one right here, was specifically chosen, as has been stated by my good friend from Connecticut, by President Bush to hang in the Oval Office. As you can see, this is a beautiful representation of the rugged landscape and the environment of our wonderful Southwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other is a portrait of Sam Rayburn. It is probably the most familiar to many of you, as it hangs in the foyer of the Rayburn House Office Building. I venture that you would be hard-pressed to find another artist who could so capture the tenacity and formidable nature of this great Texas lawmaker and former Speaker of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lea's legacy extends beyond the paintings that you see here, and I rise today because this month marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of this acclaimed El Pasoan. The 2007 Tom Lea Centennial Celebration, which is a month-long series of events, is currently underway all along our beautiful Southwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lea is a celebrated illustrator, novelist, historian, war correspondent and muralist. His assignment with Life magazine in the 1940s to draw a cavalry trooper at El Paso's Fort Bliss led to his role as an accredited artist correspondent during World War II. Traveling over 100,000 miles through very dangerous and faraway theatres of war, he captured the American forces in the North Atlantic, the South Pacific, China, and Peleliu for the American public and for those of us that appreciate his  great artistry today. While overseas, he also painted a portrait of China's Chiang Kai-shek.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From painting national and world leaders to his celebrated painting of his wife, Sarah, which includes El Paso's Franklin Mountains as the backdrop; from his critically acclaimed novels to motion pictures based on his written works; from his depictions of the heroism and harrowing circumstances of World War II to his award-winning murals in post offices in El Paso and across the country, Tom Lea has left a lasting impact on our Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, Tom Lea is a national treasure and a creative genius. I want to thank my 79 colleagues who have signed on as cosponsors to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, Mr. Speaker, I urge all colleagues to join me in honoring him by passing this resolution. My community of El Paso, Texas, was lucky to be home for such an icon, and the Nation as a whole is a richer, more interesting and more beautiful place because of his vision and his mastery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as the most distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) would like to use.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. I also rise with my colleagues who are here from El Paso, Texas, and also the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Tom Lea's birth. As a person who lived in El Paso, Texas, for a number of years, I also became aware of Tom Lea from living in San Antonio. Much of his artwork was displayed in San Antonio on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lea for many years painted pictures of the mountains and beauty that surrounds not only west Texas, but southern New Mexico also. El Paso is the beginning of what is called The Pass of the North, where two great countries come together, the history of Mexico and the history of the United States, and where these two great countries meet at the Rio Grande River. Tom Lea spent a lot of time writing, talking, thinking, pushing forward thoughts and ideas about these two great nations, and embodied  a lot of that in artwork that I have several copies of. I have bought Tom's books over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today it is right and fitting that the United States Congress in its looking back, as we do on a regular basis, over many great Americans who have added not only to the artwork of America and the thought process, but also to the lives that they lived. Tom Lea, a great Texan and American, who added not only a spirit to the men and women who fought for this country in World War II, but also brought that beauty forward in artwork, the Franklin Mountains and places in New Mexico with just stunning  beauty that have sustained so many people. It gives us an idea about why America is a great Nation and why we must continue to protect her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of this 100th anniversary of Tom Lea, a great man from El Paso and a great community, and people who loved him a great deal and miss him even more. It is a great day to say thank you to Lady Bird Johnson and Tom Lea, both great Texans, on a beautiful day in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
