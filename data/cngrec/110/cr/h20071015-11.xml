    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on October 13, Ohio Attorney General Mark Dann, U.S. Attorney Gregory Lockhart, and USDA Agent Mark Barnhart received the 2007 Humane Law Enforcement Award from the Humane Society and the National District Attorneys Association. They were honored with this prestigious award for conducting one of the largest, best coordinated crackdowns on dog fighting in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud that my home State of Ohio is taking a lead in cracking down on this vicious blood sport, but this raid also demonstrates the difficulty authorities have of prosecuting offenders under Federal law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced the Dog Fighting Prohibition Act, which would strengthen Federal penalties for those participating in dog fighting and broaden the scope of the law to allow prosecution of everyone involved, from spectators to trainers to dealers. We need to do all we can to end what has become a lucrative gambling business; and to accomplish that, we must give our law enforcement officials like Mark Dann, Gregory Lockhart, and Mark Barnhart the tools that they need. I want to thank them and  congratulate them on their efforts, and encourage support for the Dog Fighting Prohibition Act.</paragraph>
