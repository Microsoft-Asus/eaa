  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="FAMILY SERVICE ASSOCIATION OF REDLANDS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I want to recognize the Family Service Association of Redlands as it celebrates 110 years of service and support to the communities of southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a nonprofit community service organization located in Redlands, CA, the Family Service Association has been a hallmark institution of assistance and guidance to all who have sought its support. Founded as the Associated Charities of Redlands by community leader A.K. Smiley in February of 1898, this organization has a long history of care and concern for the needs of its local communities. After spending its first few years using funds from local contributors to assist the less fortunate, the  organization opened a wood yard in 1909 to provide employment for those out of work. Later, contributors would donate buildings that enabled the organization to expand and establish the first community hospital, enabling more and more community needs to be met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Family Service Association of Redlands provides a variety of services and programs to benefit needy populations of inland southern California. Their Home Again program has made a significant effort to address the growing issues of poverty and homelessness, through providing homeless families with permanent housing, employment, and family stability. Their Family Support program has made a similar dramatic effort at bringing fundamental goods and services to families in need; these include  clothing distribution, rental and mortgage assistance, utility bill assistance, motel vouchers, emergency medical assistance, dental and vision screening programs, educational and training programs, case management services, and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Family Service Association of Redlands celebrates 110 years of service and support to the communities of inland southern California, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their more than a century of accomplishments.</paragraph>
