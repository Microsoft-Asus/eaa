    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor Thomas "Emmett" Kuehl. Thomas was a volunteer firefighter for the Elkton Fire Department. He served for 17 years and was an EMT for 16 years with the Elkton ambulance crew. He died at 38 years old on April 11, 2006, from injuries sustained while operating at the scene of a fire. The 26th National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service is honoring Emmett as a fallen hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emmett was not only a brave firefighter, he was a man dedicated to his local community. As a supporter of Elkton athletics, Emmett could be counted on to drive the ambulance for the Elkton football team. For his 16 years of dedication to the team, the Elks dedicated their 2006 season to Emmett and finished runner-up in the class 9AA championships at the State tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emmett was a great American, and his commitment to the people of Elkton was truly honorable. Today I rise with Emmett Kuehl's family and friends to remember his selfless dedication and service to the Elkton community and the State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
