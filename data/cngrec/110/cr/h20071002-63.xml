  <narrative>FLORIDA STANDS AGAINST TERRORIST REGIMES -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11129]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400108" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on September 19, the State of Florida took a very principled stand against terrorist regimes by divesting roughly $1.3 billion of public employee retirement funds from companies that invest in Iran and Sudan. Iran is actively developing nuclear weapons despite protests from the international community and has repeatedly threatened to wipe the State of Israel off the map.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sudan continues to engage in genocide against its citizens, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths and more than 2 million people forced to seek refuge in neighboring countries. The American people's hard-earned money should not go towards helping state sponsors of terror or enhancing illegal nuclear programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am extremely proud of Florida and its leadership for taking this remarkable step on this issue, and I hope other States will join in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, more can always be done to stop funding and to take funding away from state sponsors of terrorism, but this is an important step that the State of Florida has taken. For that, I commend the State of Florida and the State elected officials.</paragraph>
