    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 60 minutes. The first 30 will be controlled by the majority, and the remaining 30 minutes will be under the control of the Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following this period of morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, the 9/11 legislation. This is a very important piece of legislation. That is why it has a low number. It is one of the 10 that I thought we should complete as soon as possible. I am happy we are there. I thank the Republican leader for his cooperation in allowing consent to be granted for us to switch the cloture vote from the Commerce Committee-reported legislation to <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, which is, of course, the measure  reported by the Homeland Security Committee. I hope Members will be here early to offer amendments to the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once I have laid down the substitute amendment, which will encompass provisions from several committees--Homeland Security, Banking, and Commerce--we will be ready for the amendment process. Members should expect rollcall votes throughout the day. We could go into late evening sessions. We really need to complete this bill. As I told Members yesterday, except for Friday late in the day, because of Senator Lieberman, our manager of the bill--he starts his Sabbath at sundown on Friday--we  are going to move this bill. We could very likely have Friday afternoon votes. So everyone who has airplane reservations should cover themselves because we may have to be here. If progress is not sufficient to finish this bill next week, we will have to start working longer hours. I hope we can get things available Monday so that we have more than one vote Monday night. We really need to start legislating. We have had, in my mind, too much time off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado. We have the first time, but we have no one here at this stage; they are on their way. If he would like to speak now, we will use part of his time now.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader for that opportunity. I have a bill I would like to introduce briefly this morning and talk about it for a few minutes. If somebody shows up from his side, I will yield.</paragraph>
