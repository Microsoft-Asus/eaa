  <narrative>STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS -- (Senate - July 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7032">S7032</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="Introducing S. 3297. A bill to advance America's priorities; read the first time.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing along with Senators Leahy, Lieberman, Feinstein, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, and Biden, an important bill, with provisions in a variety of areas--from advancing medical research in critical areas, to cracking down on child exploitation, to promoting important U.S. foreign policy goals, to helping improve America's understanding about the oceans. What unites this diverse package of bills?  One thing--unprecedented obstructionism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bills in this package include initiatives that have broad bipartisan support. Initiatives that have passed the House by 411 to 3; by 422 to 2; by 416 to 0. Many of these initiatives had such strong bipartisan support that they passed the House and Senate Committee by voice vote or even by unanimous consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under normal circumstances, they would have passed the Senate through a simplified and expedited unanimous consent process and become law. Maybe some would have required a period of brief debate before passing the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, instead of allowing the will of the Congress and the American people to be heard, Republicans have obstructed one bill after another. Here are just a few examples of the legislation that this bill includes--and that Republicans are preventing from becoming law:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Emmitt Till Unsolved Crimes bill: Would help heal old wounds and solve crimes that have continued to be unsolved and unpunished since the Civil Rights era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Runaway and Homeless Youth bill: Would provide grants for health care, education and workforce programs, and housing programs for runaways and homeless youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Combating Child Exploitation bill: Would provide grants to train law enforcement to use technology to track individuals who trade child pornography. Establishes an Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force within the Office of Justice Programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ALS Registry bill: WouId create a centralized database to help doctors and scientists treat and hopefully find a cure for ALS/Lou Gehrig's Disease, which afflicts 5,600 Americans every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act: Would enhance cooperation in research, rehabilitation and quality of life for people who suffer from paralysis. Not only will this bill accelerate the discovery of better treatments and cures, but help improve the daily lives of the 2 million Americans who await a cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just the tip of the iceberg. These bills address important American priorities, have broad--virtually unanimous--bipartisan support, yet, all have fallen victim to just one or two Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Democrats are not willing to allow this obstruction of a few to block the will of the Congress and the American people any longer. Republicans will have a choice: Will they join the side of the American people, or continue to stand beside one or two colleagues intent on blocking progress? I hope Republicans will end their obstruction and work with Democrats this week to pass this crucial and long-overdue legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>

  <narrative>Subtitle E--Vision Care for Kids Act of 2008</narrative>
  <narrative>SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The subtitle may be cited as the "Vision Care for Kids Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Millions of children in the United States suffer from vision problems, many of which go undetected. Because children with vision problems can struggle developmentally, resulting in physical, emotional, and social consequences, good vision is essential for proper physical development and educational progress.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Vision problems in children range from common conditions such as refractive errors, amblyopia, strabismus, ocular trauma, and infections, to rare but potentially life- or sight-threatening problems such as retinoblastoma, infantile cataracts, congenital glaucoma, and genetic or metabolic diseases of the eye.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Since many serious ocular conditions are treatable if identified in the preschool and early school-age years, early detection provides the best opportunity for effective treatment and can have far-reaching implications for vision.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Various identification methods, including vision screening and comprehensive eye examinations required by State laws, can be helpful in identifying children needing services. A child identified as needing services through vision screening should receive a comprehensive eye examination followed by subsequent treatment as needed. Any child identified as needing services should have access to subsequent treatment as needed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) There is a need to increase public awareness about the prevalence and devastating consequences of vision disorders in children and to educate the public and health care providers about the warning signs and symptoms of ocular and vision disorders and the benefits of early detection, evaluation, and treatment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 1403. GRANTS REGARDING VISION CARE FOR CHILDREN.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the "Secretary"), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may award grants to States on the basis of an established review process for the purpose of complementing existing State efforts for--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) providing comprehensive eye examinations by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist for children who have been previously identified through a vision screening or eye examination by a licensed health care provider or vision screener as needing such services, with priority given to children who are under the age of 9 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) providing treatment or services, subsequent to the examinations described in paragraph (1), necessary to correct vision problems; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) developing and disseminating, to parents, teachers, and health care practitioners, educational materials on recognizing signs of visual impairment in children.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Criteria and Coordination.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) CRITERIA.--The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate professional and patient organizations including individuals with knowledge of age appropriate vision services, shall develop criteria--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) governing the operation of the grant program under subsection (a); and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) for the collection of data related to vision assessment and the utilization of follow-up services.</narrative>

  <narrative>Subtitle A--Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2008</narrative>
  <narrative>SEC. 4001. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This subtitle may be cited as the "Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) According to President George W. Bush, "America's leadership and national security rest on our commitment to educate and prepare our youth for active engagement in the international community.". &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) According to former President William J. Clinton, "Today, the defense of United States interests, the effective management of global issues, and even an understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures beyond our borders.".</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission has submitted to Congress and the President a report of its recommendations for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at institutions of higher education in the United States to study abroad, with special emphasis  on studying in developing nations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) According to the Lincoln Commission, "[s]tudy abroad is one of the major means of producing foreign language speakers and enhancing foreign language learning" and, for that reason, "is simply essential to the [N]ation's security".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Studies consistently show that United States students score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade and business, global interdependence, and global terror.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Americans believe that it is important for their children to learn other languages, study abroad, attend a college where they can interact with international students, learn about other countries and cultures, and generally be prepared for the global age.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) In today's world, it is more important than ever for the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with significant knowledge and awareness of the world.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of imparting international and foreign-language competency to students.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) In any given year, only approximately one percent of all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher education study abroad.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from United States institutions of higher education with bachelors degrees have studied abroad.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) Far more study abroad must take place in developing countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's population growth over the next 50 years will occur outside of Europe. Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of United States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and 45 percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and France--according to the Institute of International Education.</narrative>
  <narrative> (12) The Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission Report) recommended that the United States increase support for "scholarship, exchange, and library programs". The 9/11 Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission, noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this recommendation was "unfulfilled," and stated that "The U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange programs, our most powerful  tool to shape attitudes over the course of a generation.". In its December 5, 2005, Final Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of "D" for its implementation of this recommendation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) Investing in a national study abroad program would help turn a grade of "D" into an "A" by equipping United States students to communicate United States values and way of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) An enhanced national study abroad program could help further the goals of other United States Government initiatives to promote educational, social, and political reform and the status of women in developing and reforming societies around the world, such as the Middle East Partnership Initiative.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) To complement such worthwhile Federal programs and initiatives as the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program, the National Security Education Program, and the National Security Language Initiative, a broad-based undergraduate study abroad program is needed that will make many more study abroad opportunities accessible to all undergraduate students, regardless of their field of study, ethnicity, socio-economic status, or gender.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4003. PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The purposes of this subtitle are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and international knowledge base of the United States by ensuring that more United States students have the opportunity to acquire foreign language skills and international knowledge through significantly expanded study abroad;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United States by significantly expanding and diversifying the talent pool of individuals with non-traditional foreign language skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are available for recruitment by United States foreign affairs agencies, legislative branch agencies, and nongovernmental organizations involved in foreign affairs activities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by United States students will take place in nontraditional study abroad destinations such as the People's Republic of China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing countries; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) to create greater cultural understanding of the United States by exposing foreign students and their families to United States students in countries that have not traditionally hosted large numbers of United States students.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4004.

FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) As directed by Congress in section 713 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613), as added by section 305 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. 126), the Federal Communications Commission began enforcing rules requiring full closed captioning of most English television programming on January 1, 2006.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The Federal Communications Commission rules also require that video programming be fully captioned in Spanish by 2010.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) More than 30,000,000 Americans are considered deaf or hard of hearing, and many require captioning services to participate in mainstream activities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders estimates that 1 in 3 Americans over the age of 60 has already experienced hearing loss. The 79,000,000 Americans who are identified as "baby boomers" represent 39 percent of the population of the United States and most baby boomers began to reach age 60 just in the last few years.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Closed captioning is a continuous source of emergency information for people in mass transit and other congregate settings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Empirical research studies since 1988 demonstrate that captions improve the performance of individuals learning to read English.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 5113.

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="Introducing S. 3300. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for temporary improvements to the Medicare inpatient hospital payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals and to provide for the use of the non-wage adjusted PPS rate under the Medicare-dependent hospital (MDH) program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3300">S. 3300</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rural Hospital Act of 2008. Back in December, I stood before this body explaining that we were only passing a 6-month Medicare bill in order to provide the opportunity for us to address a number of priorities. One of the biggest priorities I identified was the need to ensure access to rural hospital services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The type of rural hospitals that top the priority list are what are known as "tweeners." These hospitals are too large to be critical access hospitals, but too small to be financially viable under the Medicare hospital prospective payment systems. It is absolutely imperative that these tweener hospitals get the assistance they need in order to keep their doors open. They are often not only the sole provider of health care in rural areas but are also significant employers and purchasers in the  community. Also, the presence of a hospital is essential for purposes of economic development because businesses check to see if a hospital is in the community in which they might set up shop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Medicare bill that Congress just enacted improves the situation for some tweeners, many more are left in financial peril. It is unfortunate that comprehensive payment reforms for tweener hospitals were not included in the bill that just passed. As you know, I have long proposed a number of tweener payment improvements in previous bills this Congress and they were included in the agreement that Senator Baucus and I reached for this year's Medicare bill. Unfortunately, the core  tweener hospital payment improvements were dropped from the bill once the process became partisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for this reason that I am introducing this bill. We must improve the financial health of tweener hospitals and ensure that people have access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most tweener hospitals are currently designated as Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals under the Medicare program. While the bill that recently passed Congress improves payments for Sole Community Hospitals, there are no provisions that benefit Medicare Dependent Hospitals. This bill would benefit Medicare Dependent Hospitals by not adjusting their payments for area wages unless it would result in improved payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, a major driver of the financial difficulties that tweener hospitals face is the fact that many have relatively low volumes of inpatient admissions. Back when we passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, I made sure that this law included an add-on payment for low volume rural hospitals. This bill would improve the existing low-volume add-on payment for hospitals so that more rural facilities, both Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals,  with low volumes would receive the assistance they desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To offset the increases in spending from these tweener hospital payment improvements, this bill would address another priority that we wanted to include in a more comprehensive Medicare bill. Many know my position regarding physician owned hospitals and my concern about the effect these facilities have on health care access and costs as well as patient safety. There has been much debate regarding these facilities over the years, especially with physician owned limited service hospitals. This  bill would eliminate the exceptions under the physician self-referral laws for physician-owned hospitals and provide a limited exception for existing facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, we still have much to do when it comes to ensuring access to health care in rural America. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this urgent matter.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3304">S. 3304</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator Boxer to introduce the Brower Palisade Designation Act and honor the life of one of our Nation's most influential environmental stewards, the late David Brower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Brower Palisade Designation Act renames the North Palisade--a prominent peak in the Sierra Nevada--"Brower Palisade" in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Brower dedicated his life to environmental advocacy and helped shape the conservation movement in California and across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His efforts raised public awareness about the environment and the need to preserve our resources for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall once referred to David Brower as the "giant of 20th Century conservation in the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1952, David Brower was named the first executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the most prominent environmental and conservation organizations in the U.S. He held this position for nearly 2 decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Brower's leadership led to the creation of many units of the National Park System, including North Cascades National Park, Redwood National Park and Point Reyes National Seashore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also played a significant role in helping to draft the Wilderness Act, which has preserved much of the Sierra Nevada, including his favorite group peaks, the Palisades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Renaming the North Palisade peak "Brower Palisade" will be a lasting reminder of David Brower's leadership and invaluable contributions to the environmental community for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support the Brower Palisade Designation Act and join me in honoring the achievements of one of our most notable environmental advocates, David Brower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Veteran Voting Support Act, which Senator Feinstein and Senator Kerry have introduced today.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill will address an issue of great concern to me and to so many Americans: the rights of Americans who fight to defend our values and freedoms abroad must have the full enjoyment of those rights here at home. This legislation responds to an announcement by the Bush administration's Department of Veterans Affairs that it will ban non-partisan organizations and state election officials from conducting voter registration drives at its facilities.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is a sad commentary that in our great Nation, so many of our young veterans who have been treated shamefully by their government when it sent them into harm's way under false pretenses are again mistreated after they return home. Our troops were sent to fight an unnecessary war in Iraq--without sufficient armor, without adequate reinforcements, without a plan to win the peace, and without adequate medical care and other services to help them adapt to life upon their return.</narrative>
  <narrative>Given this President's obsession with democracy taking root in the Middle East, I would think that at a minimum he would be equally concerned with guaranteeing the right to vote to veterans returning home after risking life and limb spreading that right to others. Yet, his administration has done just the opposite. Under this President's watch, the Department of Veteran Affairs has erected barriers to voter registration that impede veterans being treated in VA facilities from participating in  the political process.</narrative>
  <narrative>First, this administration's Department of Veteran Affairs has shown little interest in, or commitment to, assisting veterans in exercising the fundamental right to vote. Since 2004, the Department has often sided in Federal court against allowing third-party organizations to conduct voter registration drives at VA hospitals. Until this past April, the Department's national policy was silent on whether it could assist disabled veterans access and complete voter registration forms. Indeed, court  findings appear to indicate that in some instances, the Department may have even prohibited its own staff from providing such assistance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Second, although the Department has made recent strides to allow veterans more access to voter registration forms, it has not gone far enough. Three months ago, the Department issued a written directive' requiring all VA facilities to develop voter registration plans that would assist patients in registering to vote. I applaud this action as a positive first step. However, I am concerned that the new directive stops short of mandating that VA facilities affirmatively offer disabled veterans a  chance to register to vote. To paraphrase Paul Sullivan, the Executive Director of Veterans for Commonsense, the new directive only changed the Department from being in active opposition to veterans' voter registration to passively supporting it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Third, and perhaps most troubling, the new directive prohibits third-party organizations and state election officials from conducting nonpartisan voter registration drives among veterans at VA facilities. I am concerned that this ban will not only undermine the Department's goal of assisting disabled veterans in registering and voting, but will also make it more difficult for these Americans to participate in the political process.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Veterans Voting Support Act would address these concerns. This important measure would designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies, thereby ensuring that the Department actively offers veterans the assistance they need to vote and register to vote. This provision would also protect disabled veterans from being disenfranchised by a procedural technicality. In addition, the bill provides our veterans with information relating to the opportunity to request an absentee ballot, ensure  the ballots are available upon request, as well as provide assistance in completing them.</narrative>
  <narrative>It would also require a meaningful opportunity for nonpartisan groups and election officials to provide voter registration information and assistance at VA hospitals. The Department was founded on the principle that its first duty to veterans was to meet their medical, social, and civic needs, including the full participation of veterans in our society. As a corollary, this provision will strengthen that mandate and send an important message to our veterans: our country will make every effort  to ensure that those who sacrificed so much to expand democracy around the globe are involved in our democracy at home.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, to ensure that the Department does not backslide from its critical function of expanding the civic involvement of disabled veterans, the bill also provides reporting requirements to ensure that the Department complies with this important goal.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Nation's disabled veterans have given extraordinary service to our country. These courageous men and women deserve our help to ensure that they receive the necessary assistance to guarantee their full participation in our democracy. I look forward to Senate passage of the Veterans Voting Support Act, and I hope the House and the President will act quickly on this legislation to ensure the implementation of this important measure in time for the upcoming national election.</narrative>
