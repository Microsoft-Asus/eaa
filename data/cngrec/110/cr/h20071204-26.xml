Many of these children are victims of sex trafficking and are forced into prostitution and other exploitative activities in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) Despite the large number of children trafficked into the United States every year, the Department of Health and Human Services has identified an average of 20 children per year as trafficking victims through fiscal year 2006. This disparity between estimated and identified victims demonstrates that much more needs to be done in educating individuals who may be coming into contact with trafficked children.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.--It is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent consistent with the treaties and other international agreements to which the United States is a party, and to the extent practicable, the United States Government should undertake efforts to protect children from severe forms of trafficking and ensure that it does not repatriate children in Federal custody into settings that would threaten their life or safety.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Combatting Child Trafficking at the Border and Ports of Entry of the United States.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.--In order to enhance the efforts of the United States to prevent trafficking in persons, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop policies and procedures to ensure that unaccompanied alien children in the United States are safely repatriated to their country of nationality or of last habitual residence.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) SPECIAL RULES FOR CHILDREN FROM CONTIGUOUS COUNTRIES.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) DETERMINATIONS.--Any unaccompanied alien child who is a national or habitual resident of a country that is contiguous with the United States shall be treated in accordance with subparagraph (B), if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, on a case-by-case basis, that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) such child has not been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and there is no credible evidence that such child is at risk of being trafficked upon return to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) such child does not have a fear of returning to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence owing to a credible fear of persecution; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iii) the child is able to make an independent decision to withdraw the child's application for admission to the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) RETURN.--An immigration officer who finds an unaccompanied alien child described in subparagraph (A) at a land border or port of entry of the United States and determines that such child is inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) may--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) permit such child to withdraw the child's application for admission pursuant to section 235(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(4)); and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) return such child to the child's country of nationality or country of last habitual residence.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) CONTIGUOUS COUNTRY AGREEMENTS.--The Secretary of State shall negotiate agreements between the United States and countries contiguous to the United States with respect to the repatriation of children. Such agreements shall be designed to protect children from severe forms of trafficking in persons, and shall, at a minimum, provide that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) no child shall be returned to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence unless returned to appropriate officials or employees of the accepting country's government;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) no child shall be returned to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence outside of reasonable business hours; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iii) border personnel of the countries that are parties to such agreements are trained in the terms of such agreements.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) RULE FOR OTHER CHILDREN.--The custody of unaccompanied alien children not described in paragraph (2)(A) who are apprehended at the border of the United States or at a United States port of entry shall be treated in accordance with subsection (c).</narrative>

FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) According to the September 7, 2005, report to the General Assembly of the United Nations by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, "In the last decade, two million children have been killed in situations of armed conflict, while six million children have been permanently disabled or injured. Over 250,000 children continue to be exploited as child soldiers and tens of thousands of girls are being subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) According to the Center for Emerging Threats and Opportunities (CETO), Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, "The Child Soldier Phenomenon has become a post-Cold War epidemic that has proliferated to every continent with the exception of Antarctica and Australia.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Many of the children currently serving in armed forces or paramilitaries were forcibly conscripted through kidnapping or coercion, a form of human trafficking, while others joined military units due to economic necessity, to avenge the loss of a family member, or for their own personal safety.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Some military and militia commanders force child soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or torture, including acts of violence against other children.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Many female child soldiers face the additional psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, enslavement for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and severe social stigma should they return home.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Some military and militia commanders target children for recruitment because of their psychological immaturity and vulnerability to manipulation and indoctrination. Children are often separated from their families in order to foster dependence on military units and leaders. Consequently, many of these children suffer from deep trauma and are in need of psychological counseling and rehabilitation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and are at risk of physical injury and disability, psychological trauma, sexually transmitted diseases, respiratory and skin infections, and often death.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) On May 25, 2000, the United Nations adopted and opened for signature, ratification, and accession the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) On June 18, 2002, the Senate unanimously approved the resolution advising and consenting to the ratification of the Optional Protocol.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) On December 23, 2002, the United States presented the ratified Optional Protocol to the United Nations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) More than 110 governments worldwide have ratified the Optional Protocol, establishing a clear international norm concerning the use of children in combat.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) On December 2, 1999, the United States ratified International Labour Convention 182, the Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which includes the use of child soldiers among the worst forms of child labor.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) On October 7, 2005, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) It is in the national security interest of the United States to reduce the chances that members of the United States Armed Forces will be forced to encounter children in combat situations.</narrative>
  <narrative> (15) Section 502B(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(3)) provides that "the President is directed to formulate and conduct international security assistance programs of the United States in a manner which will promote and advance human rights and avoid identification of the United States, through such programs, with governments which deny to their people internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, in violation of international law or in contravention  of the policy of the United States as expressed in this section or otherwise".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 404. SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the United States Government should condemn the conscription, forced recruitment or use of children by governments, paramilitaries, or other organizations in hostilities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the United States Government should support and, where practicable, lead efforts to establish and uphold international standards designed to end this abuse of human rights;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the United States Government should expand ongoing services to rehabilitate recovered child soldiers and to reintegrate them back into their communities by--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) offering ongoing psychological services to help victims recover from their trauma and relearn how to deal with others in nonviolent ways such that they are no longer a danger to their community, taking into consideration the needs of girl soldiers, who may be at risk of exclusion from disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) facilitating reconciliation with their communities through negotiations with traditional leaders and elders to enable recovered abductees to resume normal lives in their communities; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) providing educational and vocational assistance;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the United States should work with the international community, including, where appropriate, third country governments, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, United Nations agencies, local governments, labor unions, and private enterprise--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) on efforts to bring to justice rebel organizations that kidnap children for use as child soldiers, including the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Uganda, Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka, including, where feasible, by arresting the leaders of such groups; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) on efforts to recover those children who have been abducted and to assist them in their rehabilitation and reintegration into communities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Defense should coordinate programs to achieve the goals specified in paragraph (3), and in countries where the use of child soldiers is an issue, whether or not it is supported or sanctioned by the governments of such countries, United States diplomatic missions should include in their mission program plans a strategy to achieve the goals specified in such paragraph;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) United States diplomatic missions in countries in which governments use or tolerate child soldiers should develop, as part of annual program planning, strategies to promote efforts to end this abuse of human rights, identifying and integrating global best practices, as available, into such strategies to avoid duplication of effort; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) in allocating or recommending the allocation of funds or recommending candidates for programs and grants funded by the United States Government, United States diplomatic missions should give serious consideration to those programs and candidates deemed to promote the end to this abuse of human rights. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 405.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I my consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is all too common these days to see headlines in media around and about the rise of modern-day slavery. The stories are enough to turn anyone's stomach. Cambodian mothers driven by intense poverty selling their daughters into prostitution; children as young as 5 shipped to Nigeria to slave away in underground granite mines; hundreds of African boys and girls smuggled to Britain, forced to work as domestic servants; brutish uniformed soldiers dragging Burmese men and women from their homes  to labor on government construction projects; and even though it is not directly related, women in Saudi Arabia victimized by getting the lash and being convicted even though they have been a victim of rape and being utilized as sex tools or toys and sometimes being utilized as slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These nightmares unfolding thousands of miles from our shores are deeply tragic. But to many, they seem profoundly disconnected from our comfortable lives here in America. They are not. Human trafficking happens here at home right under our noses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me, of course, thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for working with Congressman Conyers and many of us on this important legislation. Let me thank Congressman Conyers for his constant and consistent leadership on this important legislation, and as well his continued work as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few weeks ago, a frightened young Tanzanian woman bravely came  before the Foreign Affairs Committee to testify. For more than 4 years, she had been forced to do domestic work without pay for a diplomat at the Tanzanian Embassy in Washington. She was denied medical care. And when this frail young woman complained that her feet were infected, she was forced outside without shoes to shovel snow. While we would all like to view this heart-rending  case as an isolated incident, it is sadly part of a growing international trend in which millions of men, women and children are forced into sexual slavery, labor or indentured servitude each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think for a moment if each of these individuals had a little camera on their back or their shoulder and we could truly see this woman with infected feet in icy snow shoveling snow, or someone who was never able to leave their house and never have any time off even here in the United States, or some of the other examples that we have already highlighted, we had a camera to see the harshness of it, the shame of it, the sadness of it, the cruelty of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trafficking is the world's fastest growing international organized crime, and one of the most profitable, yielding up to $17 billion each year. Every year traffickers move between 700,000 and 2 million women and children across international borders for the purpose of serving in the sex trade or in forced labor. Congress has worked for nearly a decade to ramp up our country's efforts to prevent trafficking, protect victims and prosecute perpetrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With approval of the bill before the House today, we can redouble these efforts and dramatically increase the ability the United States has to work to end the scourge of modern-day slavery. <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> requires the administration to compile data from every U.S. agency, international organizations and private sources so that the executive branch can prepare a comprehensive analysis of trafficking patterns. This will help us better understand where victims are actually going and how to free them.  It also provides help for countries to prevent trafficking by registering vulnerable populations that currently go unrecognized so that potential victims can be identified and educated. And it provides assistance to increase inspections abroad where forced labor occurs to help trafficking victims from slave-like conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also prevents new visas for domestic servants for diplomats in the United States who belong to any embassy where abuse of such workers occurs. This will encourage self-policing of such embassies by their ambassadors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan bill before the House will not end trafficking overnight but it will dramatically increase America's ability to stop trafficking here at home and to work with other countries to battle this rapidly growing international crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The legislation shows that it is still possible for Republicans and Democrats to work together to get something big and important done and to save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank my good friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, Chris Smith, for his extraordinary leadership on the trafficking issue for many years and for his many contributions to this important legislation. Let me also thank Chairman Payne for working with him on this issue and working together with the full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two centuries ago, William Wilberforce moved mountains to convince the British Parliament to ban slavery in the United Kingdom. In fact, there is a Historically Black College named after him: Wilberforce University. More than 140 years ago our Nation adopted a 13th amendment banning slavery right here at home. But slavery in many forms still stubbornly persists in our country, in Britain, and in nations around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Modern-day slavery must end. Our country already plays a leadership role in bringing about this supremely moral objective, but we simply must do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor, I rise in favor of the bill before us, <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. This was introduced by the chairman of our committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lantos; and it remains one of the premier issues facing us today, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It is a major source of revenue for international criminal syndicates, and it is a grave abuse against human dignity. Hundreds of thousands of people are trafficked across international borders every year. It is estimated that 80 percent of those are women, and half are children. Millions more are trafficked into sexual servitude and forced labor within their own countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Iran, children are trafficked into sexual slavery and forced into involuntary servitude as beggars and day laborers. In Syria, women trafficked from South and Southeast Asia are forced to work as domestic servants, and women from Eastern Europe and Iraq are forced into prostitution. In China, up to 90 percent of North Korean refugee women fall prey to traffickers who sell them into sexual slavery. In our own hemisphere, Mr. Speaker, Cuba has been shamefully promoted as a destination for sex  tourism that exploits large numbers of Cuban children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dehumanization and the brutality suffered by trafficking victims are nearly incomprehensible. I am proud that the Congress has helped turn this former non-issue into a priority for our United States Government and an issue, indeed, of international concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The enactment of the original Trafficking Victims Protection Act 7 years ago was a watershed event. I want to commend the author of that act and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. CHRIS SMITH, whose leadership on these issues has been central to the progress that we have made so far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there have been some signs of improvement, such as a larger number of countries that have enacted anti-trafficking legislation, other problems remain widespread. The number of countries, for example, listed in tier three, that is the most problematic category in the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, has actually increased from 12 countries to 16 since last year. Some of the governments with the worst records, such as Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Venezuela,  continue to resist making even basic efforts to protect vulnerable children and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of problem countries like Russia and China sit on the tier two "Watch List" year after year after year without further consequences, even though that category was originally created as a warning that countries are about to slip into the tier three category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, will not only reauthorize key aspects of prior trafficking legislation but it will also enhance our international anti-trafficking efforts, our domestic law enforcement and victim assistance activities, and efforts to fight the use of child soldiers worldwide. It will improve our Nation's victim-centered approach to fight human trafficking by strengthening each of the so-called "Three P's," prevention, protection, prosecution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the author of this bill again, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Lantos, and my fellow cosponsors for the perseverance and the compromise that they have invested in ensuring that this bill receive wide bipartisan support throughout consideration by the three committees of jurisdiction: Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, and Energy and Commerce. The revised text before us today also has been endorsed by an impressively broad array of organizations and experts from across the political  spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 is a vital weapon in our fight against the heartbreaking scourge of human trafficking, and it deserves our full support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the committee, I rise to yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, although we passed  the constitutional amendment against slavery in 1865, slavery still exists, not just in the world, but in the United States of America. And so we begin an examination of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, commending the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Republicans and Democrats, and commending those members of the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats, that have come together today to pass  under suspension <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Slavery is a social, ugly circumstance that still controls and guides the destiny of so many people in this country. It is important that the 13th amendment's guarantee of freedom operates, whether it involves forced prostitution, whether it operates in farms or sweat shops, or in domestic service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if you could have heard the powerful testimony that was given by our witnesses on this bill. It shocked me. People were forced to live and work under conditions of fear and terror that was extended to their parents. A young woman, who couldn't even use her real name in the committee, told about the trafficking of human beings inside of America, in the City of Detroit, where this club was using her to commit all kinds of acts and raise huge amounts of money at the same time. As one  of the television shows on NBC showed yesterday morning, guess what? There is more money being taken out of prostitution in America than in the drug industry. Drugs come number two to prostitution and involuntary servitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what brings all of us to the floor today. I am very proud of these two committees in the House that are dealing with new enforcement tools to combat modern-day slavery, whether the exploitation is by unscrupulous labor recruiters, by diplomats who abuse their services, or by brutal street pimps who coerce and keep under their domain these women, young women, at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to just take a moment here to respond to concerns to that an aspect of this bill, that it will somehow federalize prostitution. That is not the case. That is not what we are trying to do. The sex slavery offense, renamed "aggravated sex trafficking," still captures cases of coercion that implicate the 13th amendment. The new "sex trafficking offenses" improves the Mann Act to allow prosecution of pimps who affect commerce but don't actually cross State lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new tool should not diminish other anti-slavery efforts or the fight against child exploitation. We expect it to be used consistently with the principles of Federal prosecution that defer to local authority as appropriate. We want the States to control the prosecution of this offense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no place in today's America for slavery. And for that reason, <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> is critically important, because it puts new potency in the Thirteenth Amendment's guarantee of freedom: whether on farms or sweatshops, in domestic service or forced prostitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, we heard moving and powerful testimony from a young woman who has further inspired us to work together to bring this bill to the floor, to draw the line against modern slavery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bravery of that young woman, her story, and her willingness to speak on behalf of all victims of human trafficking, are an example for all of us, and a call to action for us to meet again our Nation's ongoing mission to deliver on the promise of freedom that has been enshrined in our Constitution since the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude and slavery is as important and basic a civil right today as it was at the time of Emancipation. Its promise of freedom is a sacred trust, written in the suffering of all of those who have been held in bondage. As a country, we owe it to them to never stop fighting for freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is named in honor of William Wilberforce, the famous English antislavery legislator of the Nineteenth Century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will equip our law enforcers with tough new enforcement tools to combat modern slavery, whether the exploitation is by unscrupulous labor recruiters, by diplomats who abuse their servants, or by brutal pimps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will protect immigrants and U.S. citizens alike within our country, and provide law enforcement training and victim protections overseas as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a minute to respond to concerns that aspects of the bill could somehow "federalize" all prostitution and pimping. This is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The servitude offense--which the bill renames "aggravated sex trafficking"--still captures only those prostitution offenses that implicate a liberty interest under the 13th amendment because they involve coercion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new "compelled service" crime allows more flexibility in proving enslavement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the crime entitled "sex trafficking" improves the Mann Act to allow prosecution of pimps whose activities affect interstate commerce, not just those who actually cross a State line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not our intent to redirect resources away from child exploitation, terrorism, or other important law enforcement, or to depart from the principles of federal prosecution that defer to local prosecutions where possible and serve as a "backstop" to catch the worst of the worst.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This approach maintains the structure and definitions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, and builds upon the good work of the Civil Rights Division and its antitrafficking task forces around the country. As was noted in yesterday's New York Times, these Federal and State task forces are vigorously confronting modern slavery in forced prostitution and forced labor alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expect those efforts to continue, and now to intensify with these additional enforcement tools. This bill brings law enforcement officials and service providers together, to punish traffickers and to protect victims and their families. And it provides critical immigration mechanisms to protect children and other vulnerable people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1800s, escaped slaves such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth spoke out against chattel slavery. Their voices, and the voices and efforts of many others, led to a constitutional commitment that everyone in this country would be forevermore free from slavery and involuntary servitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The young woman who testified before our committee did not allow her enslavement and incarceration to silence her either. She became a voice not only for herself, but for other victims of slavery in its various forms, many of whom remain in bondage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to her, and to the millions who continue under the oppression of modern slavery and involuntary servitude, to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the abolition of slavery was never fully achieved in our country, or anywhere else in the world. While the slavery that exists today looks different from the slavery of our country's past, it is still a widespread, horrific reality. Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It manifests itself in many forms: forced and bonded labor, sex slavery, and even militant activity, as has been seen with child soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am outraged that such an offense against humanity and against the ideals of our country is allowed to flourish on our soil and abroad. As the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Human Trafficking, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor to <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>. This reauthorization brings renewed attention to the fight against human trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, trafficking is a shared global problem which will require a global response. Congress has rightly taken the lead in putting this issue on the international agenda. Human trafficking is an issue that transcends political ideology and every faith. We have a moral imperative to put an end to this modern-day slavery. For this reason, I support <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, because I believe it will put us on the right path to finally abolishing slavery in our country and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, only through increasing public awareness to this global problem and demanding action will we bring an end to slavery. I commend the sponsor of this bill and the many Members of Congress who have joined together to bring an end to slavery once and for all.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, that I believe it is fair to describe as historic. As cochair of the Human Trafficking Caucus and as an original cosponsor, I am pleased that this bill  will provide strong, new, innovative, flexible tools to combat modern-day slavery, whether labor exploiters, diplomats who abuse their servants, or brutal  pimps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the extra offered leadership of Chairman Lantos and Chairman Conyers, as well as LAMAR SMITH and RANDY FORBES, and their staffs, for bringing this important bill to the floor. I truly do believe that books will be written about this effort, a major one, to end this terrible abuse of human people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to look at this picture. I want them to see that the lives of trafficking victims are pure horror. If you look at the first line, each girl looks different, but after one or two years, they all look the same, shells of people. In the end, they have been abused, psychologically captured, broken and devastated at the hands of their pimps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fight against human trafficking has brought together Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, religious leaders and secular leaders. I will place in the Record a list of the very large bipartisan coalition that was sent to the Department of Justice and our colleagues and signed by many advocates, including Gloria Steinem, Jessica Neuwirth, Kim Gandy, Tony Campolo, Jim Wallis, Ron Sider, Walter Fauntroy and Beverly LaHaye, among many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan bill before us is historic and will dramatically strengthen our capability to fight human trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I became interested in this when Big Apple Oriental Tours in my district was advertising sex tours, sex trafficking. Come to the Philippines, come here, come there, and we will give you a young girl, many young girls. We could not close them down.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>TRAFFICKING IN WOMEN,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York, NY, October 5, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: Founded in 1988, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women is the first international non-governmental organization to challenge the trafficking of women and girls as an acute form of gender discrimination and a severe violation of human rights. The one hundred representative signers of this letter include leaders of organizations and communities that range across the country's religious, ideological and political spectrums. What unites us is our collective  outrage at human trafficking and our commitment to end it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than six months ago, Congresswoman Maloney and Congressmen Wolf and Scott wrote to former Attorney General Gonzales to express their concerns with the Department's anti-trafficking policies and strategies. They did so in the context of his public statements that the initiative against domestic trafficking was a matter of high priority to the Department. We share these views and applaud these statements. The multibillion dollar "industry" operated within the United States by criminal traffickers  enslaves and devastates hundreds of thousands of girls and women in a manner eerily reminiscent of the 19th Century African slave trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We write because of the Department's apparent rejection of the views expressed in the Maloney-Scott-Wolf letter and because of our serious concerns about the Department's anti-trafficking activities. First, we fail to understand why the Department has called on States to enact a model statute that effectively requires proof of fraud, force or coercion for the conviction of sex traffickers, instead of encouraging State and local prosecutors to strengthen and enforce existing statutes under which  traffickers can be convicted on proof that they have "merely" engaged in sex trafficking. Our concern about the Department's model law is made particularly grave by its seriously misguided definition of prostitution as a form of "labor or services." The effect of conceptualizing prostitution as a form of "work" not only conflicts with public statements that former Attorney Generals Ashcroft and Gonzales and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Department's trafficking policy as embodied in the model law dangerously ignores is the acute difficulty of gaining testimonial evidence of fraud, force or coercion from terrified and brutalized victims of trafficking, and the potential danger that such a requirement poses to victims' safety. It is well documented that many victims enslaved by traffickers suffer from traumatic bonding and related conditions that make it impossible for them to give the testimony essential to the prosecution  of fraud, force or coercion cases. In fact, we believe that the Department's policy will cause predatory traffickers to increase their acts of violence and psychological abuse in order to ensure that the persons they abuse will not serve as prosecution witnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring proof of force, fraud, and coercion has not only had a detrimental effect on the prosecution of cases of domestic trafficking. Such proof requirements have been cited by anti-trafficking leaders in other countries as obstacles to holding traffickers accountable for their systematic acts of violence against girls and women. If trafficking victims are afraid to testify against their traffickers in the U.S., as they are, they are more afraid to do so in foreign countries with even more  violent traffickers and often less protective legal systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The approach of the Department's model law appears to be replicated in the Department's prosecution policies and strategies. We are gravely concerned by the Department's failure to more fully utilize D.C. Criminal Code &#xA7;22-2707, which makes sex trafficking per se a felony offense. In enforcing the D.C. Criminal Code, the Department functions much like State and local prosecutors, so that  vigorous utilization of Section 22-2707 would send a powerful leadership message to those prosecutors, one that would help ameliorate the negative effects of the Department's model State law. In the same vein, we are troubled by the Department's failure to more fully utilize 18 U.S. Code &#xA7;2422(a), a statute recently amended by Congress that requires no proof of fraud, force or coercion and that would be of particular value in jurisdictions where major cities in different States border each</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of additional aspects of the Department's anti-trafficking policies and strategies that trouble us, and about which we ask your views:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department has given domestic traffickers effective immunity from criminal tax laws, when otherwise legal business owners are prosecuted for such acts as failing to provide W-2 forms. Congresswoman Maloney has recently introduced legislation that would ensure that traffickers are prosecuted for violating criminal tax laws, a leadership act that builds on Senator Grassley's leadership in the 109th Congress. The Grassley bill was unanimously endorsed by the Senate Finance Committee. Will the  Department support this initiative?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of persuasive research conducted by Equality Now, the Department has failed to utilize existing criminal statutes to prosecute so-called "sex tourism" operators. Do you agree?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department prioritizes the prosecution of traffickers of girls and women brought into the United States from foreign countries. Are American citizens who have been subjected to trafficking any less worthy of the Department's protection?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department, through its grants under the Violence Against Women Act and like programs, often denies support to applicants who operate programs for trafficking survivors. Clearly, victims of domestic trafficking, routinely subjected to rape and battery, are as much in need of and as much entitled to assistance and services as victims of other forms of gender-based violence. Do you share this view, and do you believe that victims of domestic trafficking are underserved?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department has failed to pursue funds for the grant programs and the survey of the unlawful domestic commercial sex industry that were authorized by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005. Is it not important for the Department, and the country, to know as much about the predatory world of trafficking as is known about the country's gambling and drug operations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an apparent lack of coordination within the Department of its anti-trafficking activities. We believe it essential, as called for in the Maloney-Scott-Wolf letter, for there to be a single, accountable office headed by an experienced criminal prosecutor to whom Congress and the American public can look for results in the conduct of the Department's anti-trafficking activities. Do you share this view?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Departmental leadership on the trafficking issue has been vested in the Civil Rights Division even though the Division's sole jurisdiction is the prosecution of traffickers who have committed provable acts of fraud, force, or coercion against adult victims. While we celebrate the highly professional and committed prosecutors who have brought such cases, we are deeply concerned that the anti-trafficking strategy adopted by the Department will shield traffickers from prosecution while encouraging  them to intensify their acts of violence and psychological abuse. Do you believe this concern legitimate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attached is a report prepared by Professor Donna Hughes of the March 13 Human Trafficking Training session conducted by the head of the Civil Rights Division's Anti- Trafficking Unit--a session broadcast to United States Attorneys throughout the country. The Hughes report demonstrates the Department's seeming disinterest  in enforcing per se statutes against trafficking.  The report also shows that the Department's anti-trafficking initiative is directed against provable physical violence rather than trafficking per se.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are dismayed by the comments of Department officials described in the Hughes report that leaders of the country's trafficking survivor community are "not ..... ready" to engage in education, awareness and service initiatives on behalf of trafficked women. Is this your perception, or the Department's, of the groundbreaking and courageous work of such survivor-led groups as GEMS, Dignity House, Veronica's Voice, SAGE, and Breaking Free?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, the administration, and a broad and fully engaged anti-trafficking coalition now in place can in our view make history, and do so this year, in ending the reign of terror and enslavement long practiced by traffickers operating within this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, effective prosecution of domestic traffickers, and committed Federal government support for their victims, will strengthen the capacity of the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Office to deal with countries that are complicit or indifferent to mass trafficking within their borders. Such action would save millions of trafficked and at risk girls and women throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department has significantly increased the number of its trafficking prosecutions and the resources it has committed to anti-trafficking activities. Yet in spite of this, there has been no decline in the incidence of domestic trafficking or in the number of girls and women abused and destroyed by domestic traffickers during the five year period in which the Department has conducted its costly antitrafficking initiative. Moreover and critically, the model law promoted by the Department has  produced few if any State prosecutions or convictions--an outcome that we are certain will continue for the reasons set forth in this letter. Until the Department begins prosecuting and calling for the prosecution of traffickers on a per se basis, and ends its effective call for limiting such prosecutions to cases where fraud, force</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren), an esteemed member of the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="SERVICE PROVIDERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, women brought to Northern California from China with false promises of life in a far-off land, only to be trapped in prostitution; Mexican women forced to serve up to 50 men each day in dingy brothels in New York; African teenagers held in servitude as nannies in Washington, D.C.; American women and girls lured on to the streets with promises of love and glamour, only to be held in prostitution through coercive force; the issue of human trafficking  is a moral tragedy, perpetrated against the most vulnerable of our fellow human beings. Whether it be the sexual exploitation of children or the forced labor of young men in the drug trade recently chronicled in the London Economist, it is a transnational stain which should evoke the singular emotion of revulsion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Human trafficking is tantamount to slavery, and therefore it is most fitting that <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> be entitled be entitled the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, for, as we know, William Wilberforce, was a leader among English abolitionists and played a crucial role in the passage of both the Slave Trade Act of 1807 and the Slave Abolition Act of 1833, shortly before his death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The promise of freedom and the prohibition against involuntary servitude enshrined in the 13th amendment to our Constitution is a clear statement of the opprobrium which we hold for the notion that some human beings should be used as chattel for exploitation by others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, our commitment to this first principle predates the Constitution, for it was Thomas Jefferson who penned those immortal words in the preamble of our Nation's foundational statement of political philosophy that there are certain inalienable rights with which we are endowed as human beings by our Creator, and it is this source of ours rights which render them inviolable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was affirmed by that other bookend of human freedom, the Gettysburg Address, where President Lincoln visualized the fulfillment of the Declaration with the admonition that "All men are created equal," or, as we would put it today, all human beings are created equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, Mr. Speaker, the specter of a modern version of slavery cuts against our national aspirations as people. The Wilberforce Act is thus an appropriate expression of our collective outrage over this more recent transgression of basic human rights. And although I might have crafted the response to some of the issues addressed in this legislation differently, we must not allow the perfect to overcome or be the enemy of the good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> provides resources so that nongovernmental organizations, Federal and local law enforcement, and faith-based entities can work together towards a common aim of justice. The bill holds forth the promise of a new birth of freedom for those coerced into sexual slavery and child exploitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would be remiss were I to fail to add that the Wilberforce Act exemplifies what is possible when Members of this body are willing to cross the aisle in order to address real-life problems which compel a response from all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask for a unanimous vote in support of the Wilberforce Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Crime Subcommittee, who has worked with us in a highly cooperative way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="SERVICE PROVIDERS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. Human trafficking for exploitive labor, sex or other exploitive reasons, is equivalent to modern-day slavery in many instances and requires a concerted effort among the nations of the world not only to control it, but eventually to end it. I am pleased that the United States is leading an effort to root out this dreadful form of misery and suffering, and I am proud to be part  of that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we need to make sure that we do what we can to stop and prevent it here in the United States. In this regard, I am particularly pleased with the provisions in the bill which strengthen the ability of the Department of Justice to deal with abusive commercial sex traffickers who have been able to victimize women and children with relative impunity because of the difficulty of getting victims to testify as to force, fraud or coercive tactics or to show that they were trafficked across  State lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also strengthens the ability of the Department of Justice to address domestic sex trafficking by transferring the responsibility of the prosecuting domestic sex trafficking cases from the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice to the Criminal Division, both when it is commercial sex trafficking, where force, fraud and coercion can be proved, and when it is trafficking where force, fraud and coercion cannot be proved. The Civil Rights Division continues to have jurisdiction  in cases where slavery is involved, but the existence of force, fraud or coercion in commercial sex trafficking cases in and of itself does not constitute the conditions of slavery which the Civil Rights Division prosecutes as a civil rights violation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400640" topic="SERVICE PROVIDERS">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we approach the end of the year with much serious legislative business remaining before us, we have a noteworthy opportunity today to pass a measure in which each and every American can justifiably take great pride. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act represents the culmination of extensive work and exemplary bipartisan cooperation. It illustrates what we in this House can achieve when we unite in recognition of shared and enduring truth  in an effort to defeat one of the world's most glaring injustices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Human trafficking is a singularly merciless and degrading criminal activity. It has deeply tarnished every nation, including our own. Its ruthless perpetrators brutally exploit and devastate the lives of innocent persons, including children, often turning bastions of freedom and civil society into nightmarish realms seemingly beyond the reach of sanctuary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend my distinguished colleagues Mr. Smith of New Jersey and Mr. Lantos of California for raising awareness about this cruel enterprise and for leading the Foreign Affairs Committee in taking substantive, credible actions to bring hope and healing to victims of this pernicious global trade in human beings. I also want to thank them for working to incorporate the Child Soldier Prevention Act of 2007 into this bill, bringing years of hard work to  fruition and recognizing our Nation's commitment to ending the forced conscription, recruitment or use of children in combat, yet another grave affront to human dignity. I also wish to commend many individuals throughout our government and the many nongovernmental organizations whose tireless efforts have made this moment possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in passing the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Together, let us end the nightmare of human trafficking and lead the world to see, in the poignant words of Alexis de Tocqueville, that America is great because America is good.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is one of the greatest human rights tragedies of our time. The passage of this legislation will bring thousands of victims of slavery out of the shadows and prosecute those that would take advantage of voiceless souls for a marginal profit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the key provisions in this legislation is the prevention and punishment of diplomats who abuse their servants. As many as 50,000 women and children, according to the Department of State, are trafficked into the United States annually and are trapped in slavery-like situations, including forced prostitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, no government agency tracks instances of forced domestic labor at the hands of diplomats. Last year, the State Department issued about 2,000 domestic worker visas. In the plush residences of diplomats, servants' passports can be withheld. Many are paid as little $1 a day and suffer emotional and physical abuse. While the Department of State has indicated that some diplomats are asked to leave because of domestic abuse, it is unclear how many are prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are redefining our policies on human trafficking, and I would hope that with these new provisions we are able to crack down on this loophole that makes it too easy for diplomats to abuse their domestic servants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diplomats currently hide behind diplomatic immunity. This should not be the case when it comes to serious crimes such as human trafficking. They abuse domestic servants, and it is increasingly hard to prosecute them. This has to change. This legislation will help prevent future instances of domestic servant abuse in diplomatic residences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I look forward to these new provisions being implemented by the Department of State as they attempt to eliminate all forms of slavery, and I thank both committees for getting this legislation to the floor and urge everybody to vote for it.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="SERVICE PROVIDERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her outstanding leadership and for that of the chairman of the committee, Tom Lantos. He has been extraordinarily effective in this fight against modern-day slavery, and I thank him for his leadership as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Public Law 106-386, has made, I believe, an enormous positive difference in our efforts to end modern-day slavery, a nefarious enterprise that nets the exploiters billions of dollars each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 7-year-old landmark law and its numerous reinforcing provisions to prevent trafficking, to protect victims and to prosecute to the max those who traffic, has been a model statute worldwide. Indeed, many of its provisions have been adopted into law in whole or in part by governments around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the TVPA of 2000 does not pull any punches. By naming the names of countries out of compliance with what we call minimum standards and by imposing smart sanctions that are prescribed in the act, the withholding of nonhumanitarian aid, for example, we have signaled to the world that ending this egregious practice is among the highest priorities of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>By protecting the victims and not sending them back to their home country where they are often exploited in a vicious cycle of exploitation, we say to the victims we will make every effort to make you safe and secure. By prosecuting the traffickers and imposing serious jail time, we are telling these exploiters we are coming after you, we will hunt you down, and you are going to pay for your crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the enactment of the TVPA, the traffickers here and abroad are increasingly likely to face prosecution and conviction. In the 6-year period before its enactment, DOJ prosecuted 89 suspected traffickers. In the last 6 years, the Justice Department has prosecuted 360, representing more than a 300 percent increase. The Department has secured 238 convictions and guilty pleas, compared with 67 in the same period prior to the act. And it has opened 639 new investigations, an almost four-fold  increase over the 128 opened prior to implementation of the law. Worldwide, nearly 6,000 traffickers were prosecuted last year alone, and more than 3,000 were convicted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding these successes, it is clear that more has to be done to destroy this mob-infested, criminal enterprise known as human trafficking. According to research sponsored by the U.S. Government and completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked internationally and millions more are trafficked within their country. According to the same research, the vast majority of transnational victims, almost 80 percent, are women and girls, and almost half of those 800,000 victims  are minors. These figures are low compared to those posited by the International Labor Organization, which estimates 12.3 million people are subjected to forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, and sexual servitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, is a very good piece of bipartisan legislation; and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for his extraordinary leadership on this. We are working in a partnership, and it is really making a difference. The legislation that is before us aims to update, expand, and improve the TPVA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been lessons learned since the first law was enacted 7 years ago and subsequently reauthorized in 2003 and 2005. They are incorporated into this legislation as we try to do an even better job in mitigating the suffering of the victims while simultaneously going after those who traffic and the countries that harbor traffickers who are also part of the problem themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is appropriately named after William Wilberforce, who was 21 years old when he was elected to the House of Commons in 1780. John Newton, the former slave captain turned convert to Christ, encouraged Wilberforce as well as others to fight the battle against slavery. Wilberforce agreed and then poured his heart into that battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wilberforce once said: "Never, never will we desist until we extinguish every trace of this bloody traffic to which our posterity, looking back to the history of those enlightened times, will scarce believe that it has been suffered to exist so long to disgrace and dishonor this country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also said: "So enormous, so dreadful, so remediable did the trade's wickedness quickly appear that my own mind was completely made up for its abolition." We need to fight with Wilberforce-like tenacity against this modern-day slave trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most prominent provisions of the original TVPA was the establishment of the tier-ranking system that indicates how well or poorly a country is conforming to the minimum standards. We found when we created the watch list that some of the countries began to realize they could be "parked" there with no serious consequence for their failure. Tier 2 watch list countries found there was no penalty even though they made no improvements. That has to change: Two years and then you are off  the watch list, up or down. If significant improvements fail to materialize, that country is put on tier three, subject to penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that effective cooperation, and especially the bipartisan cooperation we see here today, and partnership with other countries, is essential if we are to win this winnable war. Without it, we are doomed to either meager results or outright failure. With so many lives hanging in the balance, failure simply is not an option. None of us alone can stop human trafficking. Too much evil is involved here, and the prospect of making billions has enticed some of the  most unsavory and cruel individuals on Earth, including organized crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too much demand, enabled by crass indifference, unbridled hedonism and misogynistic attitudes has turned people, especially women, into objects, only valued for their utility in the brothel or in the sweatshop. And the relative lack of visibility makes the task of combating trafficking all the more difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trafficking, like germs, infection and disease, thrives in shadowy and murky places. But the contagion slows and it even dies when exposed to the light. This legislation brings more light, bright light, to this problem; and it will act as a powerful disinfectant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the challenge to us today is to bring this new light, the bright light of sustained scrutiny and enacting good laws, like this one, and then implementing them aggressively. We need to employ best practices and well-honed strategies in order to win the freedom of the slaves and to spare others unspeakable agony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, we can make the pimps and the exploiters pay by doing serious jail time as well as the forfeiture of their assets, their boats, their villas, and their fat bank accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can end this barbaric, cruel modern-day slavery. Make no mistake about it, this is a winnable war but we need to fight in a way so as to win. This legislation further propels us in that fight, and we will win this and the slaves will be free.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill delivers on the promise of the 13th amendment by creating tough new enforcement tools to punish exploitation, whether by unscrupulous labor recruiters, diplomats who abuse their servants, or brutal pimps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides resources so that nongovernmental organizations, Federal and local law enforcement, and the faith community can work together to liberate victims and bring their traffickers to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will protect victims of modern slavery in the United States and provide foreign aid and diplomatic tools to combat modern slavery overseas as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, the fight against modern slavery began in New York City in the mid-1990s. There was the infamous "Bowery Brothel" case in which Thai women were held in prostitution and literally chained to their beds. And there were the so-called "Deaf Mexican" trinket peddlers who were enslaved under our own eyes, unable to ask for help as they were forced to beg on the subways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, criminal civil rights investigators have uncovered examples of enslavement across the country, including many in the New York City area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, we have seen the liberation of Honduran women who were forced to drink and dance with clients in dance halls in New Jersey; Peruvian families freed from enslavement by a labor recruiter on Long Island; and the rescue of young American women from a street pimp in Connecticut. All of their traffickers have been convicted and imprisoned because they violated the Constitution prohibition against involuntary servitude and slavery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than a century after the abolition of slavery, we would expect slavery to be a closed chapter in our Nation's history. But, unfortunately, it is not. The Constitution promises to end the suffering of all those who have been held in bondage. As a country, we owe it to the victims of modern-day slavery never to stop fighting for their freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, renews our commitment to fulfilling the promise of the 13th amendment by providing new enforcement tools and more resources to remove the stain of modern-day slavery from our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge its adoption and thank the chairman of the committee and Mr. Smith who was involved in developing the 2000 act and in developing this act, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill, the Wilberforce bill, tracks the definitions in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of the year 2000, builds upon the good work of the civil rights division within the Department of Justice and its anti-trafficking task forces around the country which vigorously confront modern-day slavery which does exist in forced prostitution and forced labor alike. We expect these efforts to continue, and we will monitor them with great scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1800s, escaped slaves such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, who came out of this brutal experience in America, spoke out against chattel slavery. Their voices and the voices of many others led to a constitutional commitment that everyone in this country would be forevermore free from bondage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reaching Across Party Lines To End Modern-Day Slavery</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Zoe Lofgren and Dan Lungren)</narrative>
  <narrative>They are age-old stories. Women brought to the Bay Area from China with false promises of life in a far-off land, only to be trapped in prostitution. Latino men laboring in debt bondage on ranches and farms in inland valleys. These stories may be redolent of the Gold Rush and frontier days, but in fact are situations that have been uncovered in present-day California. Some call it human trafficking, perhaps to make the crime less disturbing to confront. We call it modern slavery. It must be stopped.</narrative>
  <narrative>Especially in the past decade, federal criminal civil rights prosecutions have uncovered cases of enslavement across the country. The litany of cases goes on and on, each one equally tragic: Mexican women forced to serve up to 50 men each day in dingy brothels in New York; African teenagers held in servitude as nannies in Washington, D.C.; American women and girls lured onto the streets with promises of love and glamour only to be held in prostitution through coercive force; African-American  men laboring in orange groves of Florida trapped by drug addiction and "company-store" debts; Asian workers trapped in sweatshop garment factories in American Samoa and Saipan; Honduran women forced to drink and dance with clients in dance halls in Texas; and mentally ill white Americans forced to work on a Kansas farm.</narrative>
  <narrative>From the beginning, the promise of freedom enshrined in the 13th Amendment has protected everyone in the United States, whether African-Americans, Latinos, Asians or Europeans.</narrative>
  <narrative>Slavery might seem like a closed chapter in our nation's history, but it is worth remembering that the civil rights movement was only possible after the NAACP and the FBI worked together during the Roosevelt administration to dismantle the system of sharecropping and peonage in the American south.</narrative>
  <narrative>Even today, farmworker advocates routinely have to fight against enslavement in the fields before they can address other concerns that the migrant community faces. Asian-American community activists and legal service providers have built their efforts upon the successful liberation of workers from the notorious El Monte sweatshop more than a decade ago.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Constitution's promise of freedom is written in the suffering of all of those who have been held in bondage. As a country we  owe it to them to never stop fighting against servitude and slavery.</narrative>
  <narrative>This week, the House of Representatives will consider a bill that we are co-sponsoring to update our anti-slavery statutes, the William Wilberforce Act. Named in honor of the famous English legislator who fought the transatlantic slave trade in the 19th century, the proposed law will provide new tools to protect against modern slavery. The law will protect people in the United States, both in the immigrant community and among American citizens, and will provide foreign aid and diplomatic tools  to combat slavery and trafficking overseas as well.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Wilberforce Act protects workers, ensures compassionate immigration treatment for children, and allows for the reunification of victims and their families. The bill delivers on the promise of freedom by creating tough new enforcement tools to punish exploitation, whether by unscrupulous labor recruiters, diplomats who abuse their servants or brutal pimps.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill provides resources so that non-governmental organizations, federal and local law enforcement and the faith community can work together to liberate victims and bring their traffickers to justice. In our congressional districts--in the South Bay and Sacramento--such interdisciplinary task forces have begun the important work of implementing state and federal anti-trafficking statutes. The Wilberforce Act will allow them to intensify their efforts.</narrative>
  <narrative>There are some who feel that there is no room for bipartisanship in Washington. Some say that the political parties are so far apart as to preclude any cooperation at all, especially on legislation that combines compassionate and pragmatic immigration solutions with tough law enforcement standards. The Wilberforce Act disproves that notion. We will continue to work together to ensure that no one is held in bondage in California or elsewhere.</narrative>
  <narrative>Coretta Scott King once said "Freedom is never really won--you earn it and win it in every generation." We are proud that the California congressional delegation can come together across party lines to lead the fight to guarantee the constitutional promise of liberty for all.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, the William Wilburforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, for introducing this important, bipartisan legislation that will authorize appropriations for FY 2008-2011 for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, enhancing measures to combat forced labor, as well as for your ongoing leadership  on this and other crucial human rights issues. I am proud to join over 40 of my colleagues in co-sponsoring this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the issue of the trafficking of persons is one of the utmost significance, one which no nation is exempt from. Within the United States, we pride ourselves on overcoming the historic stain of slavery, and we are comforted by the thought that while others may persist in this repulsive practice, we do not. This however, is simply not the case. According to the GAO, "as many as 17,500 people are believed to be trafficked into the United States each year." The trafficking of persons  is our problem; they are forced through our borders and used by our people. This extreme injustice can no longer go unnoticed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flow of human trafficking is no surprise; traffic flows from the less industrialized countries to the more industrialized countries. This fact makes the issue of human trafficking a problem for all nations alike on a political, social, and moral level. The U.S. Department of State estimates that 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders every year, in addition to the reported millions of people trafficked within their own countries. The trafficking industry generates billions  of dollars annually, and, together with drugs and weapons, is now a leading source of profits for organized crime. According to most analysts, the largest number of victims trafficked internationally come from Asia, though significant numbers of women and girls trafficked to work in the commercial sex industry come from the former Soviet Union and southeastern Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One subset of trafficking, and one of particular interest to the United States, is trafficking for forced labor, which the International Labor Organization defines as "any situation in which work is carried out involuntarily under the menace of a penalty." The ILO estimates that some 12.3 million people have been the victims of forced labor, with agriculture, construction, domestic service, restaurants, and manufacturing sectors being the most prominent industries into which forced labor is  trafficked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of this year, the Committee on Homeland Security, on which I am a senior Member and I serve as Chairwoman of a subcommittee, held a hearing on the crossing of borders and victims of trafficking which produced a meaningful discourse on horrific implications of the trafficking of persons and sought to address said issues. However, 7 months later, the issue is not resolved. The current policy of the United States, under the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act of 2000, allows the government  to support many types of anti-trafficking domestically and overseas. However, much more must be done. The GAO currently reports that, while the government allocated funds to combat trafficking, there was an overemphasis by the government on sex slavery, which came at a price for the majority of others who are a victim of human trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reliable information and independent evaluations of the success of the United States in combating this human atrocity have been hard to come by. While the State Department points to progress by citing the increase of countries with anti-trafficking initiatives and an increase in the number of arrests and convictions for human traffickers, the GAO report cites a less optimistic reality. The U.S. Government has yet to develop a coordinated, interagency response to combat trafficking overseas or  a systematic way to evaluate the effectiveness of its anti-trafficking policies. In addition, a July 2007 GAO report entitled "Monitoring and Evaluation of International Projects Are Limited, But Experts Suggest Improvements," found that monitoring mechanisms</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the very real and persistent nature of the crime of human trafficking, it is our responsibility as Members of the Congress of the most powerful nation in the world to address and resolve this atrocity once and for all. Nearly 150 years after our great country abolished slavery at home, it is our job to once again be a beacon of progress and hope and no longer allow one man to profit from the suffering of another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this legislation makes important strides towards addressing this serious problem. After hearing the profoundly disturbing testimony presented before the Committee on Foreign Affairs in a hearing on this issue earlier this year, I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes provisions aimed at ensuring that individuals are trafficked into the United States to work in diplomatic missions and embassies. I an extremely concerned about this issue, and I look forward to working  further with my colleagues to establish a mechanism capable of preventing such abuses in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this important reauthorization speaks directly to a serious but often hidden problem that we face, on both a national and an international level. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my support for <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2007. I have long worked to support action on what may be considered the most egregious human rights violation occurring in the world today. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, TVPA, which created an office at the U.S. State Department to monitor trafficking in persons around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trafficking of people and the effects on victims--mostly women and children--can only be described as evil. In many cases, women and children are misled and forced to move across borders, to live in a foreign country, alone, away from family, friends and any kind of support network. They are then bought, sold, and forced into the sex trade. Billions of dollars are generated each year through trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the United States is also a destination for some of these victims. It is shocking to learn about women being held as sex slaves literally in houses and basements that I drive by every day on my way to the Nation's capital. This reauthorization addresses this aspect of international trafficking by protecting victims in the United States from retaliation by those who trafficked them; expanding and revising U.S. criminal violations to allow offenses against international trafficking  criminals and sex tour operators; ensuring assistance to U.S. victims of trafficking, and preventing the trafficking of foreign children found in the United States by ensuring that they are not repatriated into the hands of traffickers or abusive families and are well cared for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The focus and commitment of the administration on this issue is making a difference in Countries around the globe. We still have a long way to go, but this reauthorization bill is a significant step in giving the State Department the necessary tools to combat this appalling practice. It is a privilege for me to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that today the House of Representatives passed <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue that impacts countries around the world, whether they are a source or destination for trafficked persons. Official estimates are that between 2 to 4 million persons are trafficked each year, including approximately 17,500 individuals who are trafficked into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One country that is a major source of trafficking victims is Vietnam. The congressional district that I represent in Orange County, California, is home to one of the largest Vietnamese constituencies outside of Vietnam. Hence, I have met with many people who have been trafficked from Vietnam, as well as advocates who work to help these victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have personally visited Vietnam 3 times, and it has been apparent from my trips that human trafficking is a major problem facing women, children, and men in Vietnam. Vietnamese women are trafficked to other countries in Asia and elsewhere, where they are subsequently forced into marriage, labor, and prostitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often, Vietnamese women are promised employment, and given fake working papers, but then they are instead sold into marriage, the commercial sex industry, or labor. These women often find themselves in a foreign country, with no legal status, and no ability to speak the language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the large numbers of trafficked persons from Vietnam, and around the world, I am glad that the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act adds technical assistance and support to assist foreign governments with the prevention and prosecution of human trafficking cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical that the United States share its resources to combat trafficking with the rest of the world. All of the members of our world community must work together to fight human trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States must also work to improve its efforts to combat trafficking within our own borders. This bill will assist with enhancing the rights of victims, who are trafficked into the United States, and will provide special protections to child victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> is an important step in the worldwide fight against human trafficking. At the same time, we must continue to work on this issue in our local communities. In my district, a number of agencies, including law enforcement, service providers, and community organizations have joined together to form the Orange County Human Trafficking, Task Force (OCHTTF).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This task force operated for several years without any funding. I am proud that I was able to help them secure funding to continue their collaborative efforts to fight human trafficking. I commend the OCHTTF for its efforts, and hope that more local communities will stand together to protect the rights of all persons to live free from forced marriage, prostitution, and labor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2007. This bill makes great strides in both the areas of prevention and in victim assistance and will strengthen our national commitment to ending this horrific practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its founding, our Nation has been committed to the promotion of human rights and personal dignity. Human trafficking contradicts every core principle upon which our Nation and our international partnerships are based.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, we have seen appalling examples of trafficking--from women sold into sexual slavery ..... to men being pressed into indentured servitude ..... to children forced to become soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trafficking frequently is tied to other illicit crimes--prostitution, drug running, sweatshops, and armed rebellions. Sadly, the victims have few champions and even fewer resources. And, all too often, national leaders have turned a blind eye to this growing epidemic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today our strategy is twofold. First, we are extending care and assistance to the victims while protecting them from their traffickers. Second, we are bolstering our efforts to work with international and domestic law enforcement to prevent trafficking at the source. It is essential that we remain dedicated and committed to each track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, while it is not included in this bill, it is my hope that the administrators of the programs will consider the special needs of the victims and will look into the "reflection periods" in place in several countries. This allows additional time for former victims to become comfortable in their new situations before taking further action against their traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am proud to support this legislation and to urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, over half a million people are sold into slavery and transported across international borders worldwide. Of those, more than 15,000 are brought into the United States. These individuals are sold into horrible living conditions which most often include forced labor and sexual slavery for many young girls and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inhumane practice of involuntary servitude and sexual slavery must be stopped in the United States and victims should have proper protection from their captors. This deplorable treatment of human beings is intolerable. The idea of forced slavery is one which most Americans would find repugnant but unfortunately, it is all too often a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressional action on this matter is woefully deficient. We must recognize the importance of stopping, monitoring, and capturing individuals as they illegally enter the United States. Fighting human trafficking at the borders would limit the trade of sex slaves in America as well as combat terror, crime and drugs to preserve American safety and quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent news reports have stated that Al Qaeda has been using our vast and poorly defended Southwestern borders to smuggle enemy combatants into the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must find a way to stop smuggling of human beings across our borders. We must find a way to stop involuntary servitude and sexual slavery worldwide and we must find a way to help all people understand that America is the beacon of light and freedom that we all know it to be. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 (<bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>) will help us stop this terrible trade, give victims the ability to be free and face their accusers, and help America shine our light around  the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has exercised unprecedented leadership in the global fight to combat trafficking in human beings, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, the Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From our earliest awareness of this cruel phenomenon which enslaves an estimated 27 million victims, the Commission has led in the effort to mobilize nations to implement effective measures to combat human trafficking. My fellow Commissioner and former Chairman of the Commission, Representative CHRIS SMITH is among those who has led the effort to bring an end to this modern day form of slavery, authoring the trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its subsequent reauthorizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Commission continues its work to support efforts to combat this global crime within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Most recently, the Commission conducted an oversight hearing last October 11, to explore the progress made in combating human trafficking and the adequacy of resources dedicated to identifying victims of trafficking for forced labor, an area that we believe would benefit from additional resources and attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reauthorization bill that we are taking action on today marks another important milestone in preventing the inhumane practice of human trafficking, protecting trafficking victims, and prosecuting the criminals that perpetrate these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to bolstering the resources needed to continue various anti-trafficking programs, <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, which I cosponsored, would strengthen mechanisms for fighting human trafficking overseas, through the provision of capacity building support to foreign governments to bolster investigative mechanisms and legal protective frameworks for immigrant populations and migrant workers. Importantly, the measure would also address the transnational nature of human trafficking by providing increased  support and protection for refugees and internally displaced populations. This legislation also seeks to improve transparency and evaluation of trafficking programs, and would designate governments that remain on the special watch list for 2 consecutive years among those whose efforts to combat trafficking are inadequate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization bill will improve mechanisms to better identify and protect trafficking victims, while increasing accountability on the part of governments in their anti-trafficking efforts. It takes a comprehensive approach to a gross criminal exploitation, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the deplorable crime of human trafficking exploits the innocent while it promotes illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are considering today builds upon the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. That historic legislation combated the trafficking of persons into the sex trade and slavery in the United States and countries around the world through the prosecution of traffickers and through protection and assistance to victims of trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee in 2000, I worked closely with the sponsors of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to ensure that it protected victims of trafficking without encouraging the smuggling of illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation created a new nonimmigrant T visa for victims of severe forms of trafficking who have cooperated with U.S. law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act judiciously expands on the immigration provisions of the 2000 Act and also adds reasonable protections for unaccompanied alien minors apprehended by our immigration officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I reviewed the original bill, my goal was to modify certain provisions that I was concerned would encourage illegal immigration and immigration fraud and leave us vulnerable to dangerous juveniles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman CONYERS and Chairwoman LOFGREN for addressing those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman CONYERS for addressing my concerns with the criminal provisions of the original bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill now lessens the burden on prosecutors to prove that criminals forced victims to work in sweatshops or as prostitutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do remain concerned about increasing the Federal role in prosecuting cases involving pimping and pandering. These crimes are traditionally prosecuted at the State and local level and I believe that Federal jurisdiction is unnecessary. However, I will not oppose this bill on that basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
