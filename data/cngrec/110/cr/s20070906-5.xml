  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period for the transaction of morning business for 1 hour. The time will be equally divided and controlled. The majority controls the first portion and the Republicans control the last portion. Under an order entered last night, we will resume the Military Construction appropriations bill after morning business. There are five amendments that are remaining that are in order that are going to be disposed of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Senate completes action on the Military Construction bill, the Senate will begin consideration of the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The managers of that will be Senator Leahy and Senator Gregg. This should be a busy day with votes throughout the day. In addition, the education reconciliation conference report will be available and, as I mentioned earlier this week, we will act on that measure this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will talk in more detail with the Republican leader when we have a better picture of what is going on with the Foreign Operations bill and how long it is going to take to dispose of the Military Construction-VA bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats and Republicans worked well together yesterday. We have a lot to do. One of the things we have to do is look forward to somehow funding the Government after October 1. There will be consultations between the Republican leader and me and the appropriations people on Capitol Hill. Also, we have the President to deal with on these issues. Even though there has been a lot made about the difference between what the President wants and what Congress wants, it is not that much different. I  hope we can work out those issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyway, we have a picture ahead of us of what we need to do, and we will proceed to do that business as quickly as we can today and hopefully finish everything today, tomorrow and hopefully not have to worry about tomorrow afternoon or even Saturday. I hope we need not do that. We will keep everyone informed as soon as we can.</paragraph>
