  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER JOHN W. ENGEMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the lush green hills of Arlington Cemetery, where peace holds its gentle sway, there is a headstone inscribed with the name of John W. Engeman. On it are his rank of chief warrant officer, and his honors, the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. But, like all of the iconic white markers at Arlington, it only tells part of a hero's story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chief Warrant Officer Engeman enlisted in the Army when he was 18, and was stationed in Korea and Germany, and served in Kosovo and Operation Desert Storm. Two years ago, he moved with his family to West Virginia, where he was the active duty liaison between the National Guard and Reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he was more than a career military man; he was also a devoted father and husband, brother and son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The soldiers in his unit called him a father figure and a great story teller. They recalled that whenever they needed advice, they always went to the Chief. They said they would follow him anywhere because he was a great leader, a good decisionmaker, and a good friend. And, they said, he loved to talk about his wife Donna or his two children, Nicole and Patrick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I can only imagine how he must have felt when the Army made special arrangements for him to watch his wife graduate from college. It had been a shared goal between the two of them, and on the day before Mother's Day, he sat half-a-world away and watched the dream turn into a reality. He ended that day by telling his wife how proud he was of her, and that he would call the next day to wish her a happy Mother's Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a call that would never come. Chief Warrant Officer Engeman's humvee would be struck by a roadside bomb later that evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the earliest days of the Republic we have held a special place in our hearts for those families who have lost a loved one in war. Later this week, as part of the White House Commission of Remembrance, the family of Chief Warrant Officer Engeman will be honored, along with the families of other soldiers, sailors, and marines who have been lost in combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is altogether right and fitting that we do this. Chief Warrant Officer Engeman answered the call to duty and served with honor and distinction. He won the respect of his soldiers and the admiration of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But those truly timeless qualities--his laugh, his quirky smile he would give you when you needed his advice, and his love for his family--will live in the hearts of his wife, children, sisters, and parents forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of West Virginia joins with me today in keeping the Engemans close in our hearts and prayers.</paragraph>
