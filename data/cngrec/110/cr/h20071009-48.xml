  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider <bill type="hr" number="106">H. Res. 106</bill>, affirming the United States' record on the Armenian genocide. I will ask my colleagues on the committee to carefully consider this resolution and the vast body of evidence that supports its conclusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The allied powers of the First World War early on recognized that the Turkish Government at that time was committing crimes against humanity by perpetrating the organized slaughter of Armenians. The U.S. Congress of that time affirmed these crimes in hearings and resolutions. Though the chief organizers of this crime were convicted of the massacres by the Turkish military courts, they never were made to pay any penalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We fully recognize now the friendship of our allies in Turkey, but it cannot change the past. I hope that there can be some reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia and that a proper acknowledgment of the crimes of the past can allow them to move forward into the future of peace and mutual understanding.</paragraph>
