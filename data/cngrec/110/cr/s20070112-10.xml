  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before we proceed to the resolutions appointing our committee membership, I want to thank the majority leader for his assistance in working on this joint leadership agreement. As was agreed to in the 108th Congress, we have included language which keeps the current minority staff salary baseline from going below the allocation in the 109th if those funds are available. Given the possibility of a continuing resolution, the majority leader and the chairman of  the Rules Committee have agreed to provide each ranking member, if requested, an allocation equal to 49 percent of the 10 percent that was available to the chairman in the 109th Congress. I would further say that this money is available out of existing funds and is not considered as supplemental funds above the current funding levels.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I concur with the remarks of the Republican leader. The baseline was not reduced for Democratic staff in the 108th Congress. This agreement allows for that same accommodation for the Republican side in the 110th, if that money is available. Further, since additional funds may not be available, we have agreed that each ranking member will be allocated the amount mentioned above, if they so request, and those funds will be made available from existing funds provided by  the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by the two leaders be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
