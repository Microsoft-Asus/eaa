  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="KAGEN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last November, people in Wisconsin and all across America asked for a positive change and a new direction, and the Democratically led 110th Congress has delivered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been working hard to build a better nation by forcing Congress to be fiscally responsible, by increasing the minimum wage, and enhancing our security with the enactment of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've cut costs for higher education. We've increased veterans' benefits, and in Wisconsin, we saved SeniorCare, the best prescription drug plan in America. And yesterday, we passed legislation to guarantee access to health care for our elders and for those among us who need it most, our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And next, forward-thinking Democrats will guide us towards energy independence and confront global climate change. There is hope again all across America. We are headed in a positive and fiscally responsible direction.</paragraph>
