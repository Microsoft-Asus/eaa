  <narrative>POLITICAL GAMES SHOULD NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF PROTECTING AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16648]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BOUSTANY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Democratic leadership unveiled a half-trillion-dollar spending bill because they were unable to fulfill their constitutional duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This spending bill is 3,500 pages long, and the majority gave Members of Congress less than 24 hours to look at it. And that's simply ridiculous. We had less than 24 hours to review a bill funding our national priorities, but chock full with earmarks and frivolous spending, and it failed to go through the proper committee checks. But the liberal leadership of this House added mounds of earmarks for their friends and liberal policies that most Americans do not support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all of this spending, however, the glaring neglect by the Democratic leadership is our troops. Those fighting around the world, making us safer from al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, will not receive the necessary resources to continue their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, ensuring our Armed Forces have the tools at their disposal to defeat the terrorist threat is one of our responsibilities in Congress. And I urge all of my colleagues to remember that.</paragraph>
