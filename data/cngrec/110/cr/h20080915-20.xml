  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1335">H. Res. 1335</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the primary mission of the National Association of State Veterans Homes  is to ensure that each veteran receives the benefits, services, long-term health care, and respect each veteran deserves;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas other goals of the National Association of State Veterans Homes are to ensure that no veteran is in need or distress and that the level of care and services provided by State homes is of the highest quality;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the year 2008 marks the 120th anniversary of the first time the Federal Government granted aid to States that had established State veterans homes;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas following the Civil War, a large number of indigent and disabled veterans were no longer able to earn their own livelihood and were in need of assistance;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas after the Civil War, because the Government was unable to completely meet the needs of this class of veterans, a number of States established State veterans homes;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the first State home was established in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, in 1864;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on August 7, 1888, Federal aid was authorized for the first time to alleviate the burden of States in operating these homes;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Veterans Administration was established in 1930, which led to an expansion of State programs to include three levels of care and increased per diem payments;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1952, the National Association of State Veterans Homes was founded because of the collective need of all State homes to communicate with one another about the problems they faced and their experiences as well as to promote their interests in national legislation;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1964, the State Home Construction Grant Program was initiated, which has greatly increased the ability of State homes to meet the increasing needs of veterans;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on February 24, 1986, the Veterans Administration and the National Association of State Veterans Homes signed a Memorandum of Understanding, formalizing their mutual goal of providing quality care to veterans;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized to participate in up to 65 percent of the cost of construction or acquisition of State nursing homes or domiciliaries or for renovations to existing State homes;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs works to assure Congress that State homes are both financially equipped and institutionally competent to provide quality care to veterans through inspections, audits, and comparing records conducted by the VA medical center of jurisdiction;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas State veterans homes are currently one of the largest long-term care providers in the United States;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in a typical year, State homes will provide veterans with nearly 7 million days of nursing home care and about 1.5 million days of domiciliary care;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas currently, there are 135 State homes throughout the United States with more than 30,000 beds, which will only increase in the coming years; and  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a total of $165,000,000 has been appropriated for State homes capital projects in 2008: Now, therefore, be it  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) commends the extraordinary contributions of those who have served in the Armed Forces of the Nation;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes that the Nation has an affirmative duty to care for the men and women of the Armed Forces who have served their country faithfully;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) recognizes the efforts made by the National Association of State Veterans Homes to aid the States in providing veterans with high-quality care; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) commends the efforts made by State veterans homes for the past 120 years in ensuring that the honorable veterans of the Armed Forces of this Nation receive the highest quality of care worthy of the great sacrifices they have made. &lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Paul Hodes of New Hampshire for crafting this resolution which calls for the celebration of the 120th anniversary of our Federal Government's first grant of aid to State veterans homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize the National Association of State Veterans Homes, representing 135 State veterans homes throughout the country. They were founded to increase the State veterans home representation and help facilitate communication with one another. They have worked to improve the quality of care, the services and treatment of our Nation's veterans who reside in State veterans homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized to contribute up to two-thirds of the construction of State nursing homes or renovations of existing State homes. This funding helps provide quality care for our Nation's veterans. When veterans are no longer able to care for themselves, they must be given the care necessary to continue their life with dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, we appropriated $165 million for 2008 to provide aid to State veterans homes to continue to provide care for our veterans. This will help alleviate some of the financial burden as the cost of veterans' care continues to rise without compromising the quality of that care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must honor a servicemember's sacrifice that has been made by providing the quality of care our brave men and women deserve. It is important that we all support this resolution. With the current war on terror, there are thousands of brave servicemembers that are in the line of fire as we speak. They, too, might need this care. It is our duty, our responsibility, and our moral obligation to continue to provide them with this care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of this resolution. I praise the great work and service that State veterans homes have provided for the past 120 years. I look forward to their continued success and for this strong partnership to continue for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have a State veterans home in my district in Chula Vista, California. I visit there regularly. The morale there is very high. And I think probably one sign of their high morale is that the percentage of voting that comes out of that home is very, very high. So it shows that, not only are they cared for, but they take an interest in the government that they have to elect. So I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm also pleased to be here in support of this bill, <bill type="hr" number="1335">H. Res. 1335</bill>, a resolution celebrating a 120-year partnership between the Federal Government and the State veterans homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, following the Civil War, a number of States independently established State veterans homes in order to meet the large needs of the veterans that were indigent, a lot of them were disabled. They returned from the war, but they were unable to establish a livelihood for themselves, earn enough money. They needed care. And these were veterans who sacrificed their lives in support of their country and were severely disabled and in need of help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Federal Government operated national homes for disabled Union soldiers, the total number of veterans needing care was simply overwhelmingly. So in August, 1888, Federal sharing was formally authorized to help alleviate the burden that was placed upon the States. In 1952, the National Association of State Veterans Homes was established to help move this along. Their primary mission is to ensure that each and every eligible United States veteran receives the benefits, services, long-term  health care and respect which they have earned in their service to their country and their sacrifice for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the organization also ensures that no veteran is in need or distress, and that the level of care and service provided by State veterans homes meet or exceed the highest standards we have in our health care system today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, State veterans homes are one of the largest long-term providers in this country. In the State of Florida, for example, we currently have six State veterans nursing homes. We expect another one to open in St. Augustine in 2009. This is important because Florida is a State with ever-increasing veterans coming in, and we need to provide for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently 135 State veterans homes throughout the United States with more than 30,000 total beds. The service these organizations provide to our Nation's veterans is obviously invaluable. And I commend the State veterans homes on their 120-year partnership with the government to provide care to our veterans community with a very high standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this wonderful bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important partnership between State Veterans Homes and the Federal Government during its 120th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Veterans Homes are important long-term care providers for veterans. State Homes  provide quality health care for elderly and disabled veterans across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Veterans Homes are one of the largest long-term care providers in the United States. There are 135 State Veterans Homes throughout the United States with more than 30,000 total beds. In a typical year, State Veterans Homes will furnish nearly 7 million days of nursing home care and about 1.5 million days of domiciliary care. These numbers continue to grow in order to meet the needs of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Veterans Homes began after the Civil War, when a large number of indigent and disabled veterans were no longer able to earn their own livelihood and needed care. 2008 marks the 120th anniversary of the State and Federal partnership in providing quality care for veterans in the State Veterans Homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Veterans Homes try to ensure that each and every eligible U.S. veteran receives the benefits, services, long term health care and respect which they have earned by their service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor of visiting with veterans at the State Veterans Home in Tilton, New Hampshire. Under the dedicated leadership of Commandant Barry Conway, New Hampshire veterans have a place to receive top quality long term care in a community of fellow veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Veterans Home in Tilton has provided Concord native Dave Clark with top-quality health care. Dave is a disabled veteran with a can-do attitude, wheeling around the Veterans Home in his electric wheelchair, with a State of New Hampshire veteran's license plate that says "GROOVY."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave was born on September 28, 1945 in Concord, NH. He lived with his parents, his sister, and his three brothers for the first six years of his life, until his parents separated. Dave's sister was adopted, but he and his brothers spent the next 3 1/2  years at an orphanage in Manchester. Dave was in and out of foster homes, dreaming of becoming an astronaut or attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave changed his course when he was called up to serve his country in the U.S. Army. Dave honorably and bravely served, spending 2 years in the States before deploying to Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Vietnam, Dave's vehicle was hit by enemy fire and the troops he was carrying were killed. Dave joined a small group of Marines in a firefight, and he was hit. Four of the Marines carried him to an aid station--and Dave credits these courageous Marines for saving his life. Dave was badly injured, and then spent the next 2 years in hospitals in Seattle, WA, Washington, DC, Fort Dix, NJ, and Manchester, NH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave recovered, and restarted his life in New Hampshire. Dave met and married his wife Doris, with whom he lived in Penacook, New Hampshire until Doris's death. Dave worked at Franklin Regional Hospital as a crew leader in the Environmental Services Department, continuing to serve his State and his country with honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His new life was interrupted in March of this year when he had another stroke, leaving him paralyzed on his left side. Dave could only move his neck and his head. Dave thought he was finished after the last stroke. Dave was overwhelmed with terrible memories of the orphanage and frustrated that once again he was losing his independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when Ellen Douville from the New Hampshire Veterans Home Admissions Office came to visit, Dave realized the Veterans Home could give him the support he needed. The Tilton Veterans Home's staff and residents helped Dave regain mobility in his left arm and taught Dave to control a wheelchair with his chin. After 7 months, Dave was kicking a beach ball around in "Move It or Lose It," an exercise program for residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave is active in the Writing Group and art classes and is vice-president of the Resident Council at the Tilton Veterans Home. He has a girlfriend, Mary Tucker, who works for another healthcare organization, and this week the Veterans Home van took him to Applebee's, where he and Mary had a lunch date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave says that coming to the Tilton Veterans Home has been the best thing for him. But, Dave continues to be determined to get back the full use of his left side again. After he regains the use of his left side, he plans leaving the Tilton Veterans Home and marrying his girlfriend Mary in the Veterans Home gazebo down by the pond--where everyone from the State Home will be invited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution honors the contribution of veterans like Dave to his country, and recognizes the leaders and staff of the Veterans Homes, like Barry Conway and Ellen Douville, who spend each and every day with patience, friendship, and care for veterans like Dave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to honor the contributions of the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces and recognize that we as a Nation have a duty to serve those who have served our country faithfully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am proud to honor veterans like Dave and the hard working community of the Tilton Veterans Home, and State Veterans Homes across the Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1335">H. Res. 1335</bill>, introduced by my friend and colleague Mr. HODES, which rightly celebrates the 120-year partnership between Government and State veterans homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Veterans Homes are a critical part of the care our veterans receive after serving our country. In my State of Connecticut, the State Department of Veterans Affairs has provided care for Veterans and their dependents for 144 years, since the opening of Fitch's Home for Soldiers and Their Orphans in Darien, Connecticut on July 4, 1864--the first such facility in the Nation. In 1940, the Fitch home became the Connecticut State Veterans hospital and was relocated to Rocky Hill, Connecticut,  where Connecticut veterans today continue to receive a spectrum of care and assistance they so urgently need from dedicated professionals and volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In just a few weeks, Connecticut veterans will benefit from the opening of the first major new facility in Rocky Hill in over 65 years. The new veterans care facility will provide modern, state of the art care for Alzheimer's and hospice patients. From the new rooms that provide patients with long-needed privacy, to expanded lounge areas and family dining facilities that allow veterans to spend time with their families in a private and comfortable setting, the new facility will ensure that Connecticut  veterans receive the dignified treatment they deserve. This exciting improvement was made possible by a strong Federal commitment to the State Home Construction Grant Program, which for 44 years has helped States like Connecticut meet the ever-increasing needs of our veterans by investing in long-term capital improvement projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor of visiting the Rocky Hill facility just this past weekend, where I attended Stand Down 2008. This one-day event is an annual outreach and support program that helps needy and homeless veterans to receive services and information from over 30 State, Federal and private organizations all assembled in one location. During my visit, I observed countless volunteers from organization across the State helping needy and struggling veterans receive a variety of services, including medical  screenings, dental exams, legal assistance, housing referrals, assistance with Federal VA benefits and disability claims, job counseling and training, financial assistance and debt counseling; education programs and services and everyday necessities such as free haircuts, clothing and supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At last year's Stand Down, 750 needy veterans came to Rocky Hill to receive assistance. This year, that number is expected to reach 900 or more, an increase largely fueled by the growing needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the impact of the economic downturn on our neediest veterans. Our State Commissioner of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Linda Schwartz, has helped bring new life into this yearly event, making it an effective way to ensure that veterans have access to the  services and care they need. Under her leadership, Connecticut is stepping up to ensure that no veteran who has served their Nation is left behind. Yet, as gratifying as it was to see veterans being helped at Stand Down, the growth in the number of veterans taking advantage of the event is a stark reminder of how much more our Nation must do to ensure that our promise to those who have served is fulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all my colleagues to join me in thanking the countless professionals at the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs, volunteers and organizations that came together at Connecticut's Stand Down in helping to make a difference in the lives or our veterans.</paragraph>
