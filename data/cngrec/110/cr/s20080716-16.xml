  <narrative>HIGH GASOLINE PRICES -- (Senate - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6806">S6806</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to talk as well about high gasoline prices. I agree with my colleagues that this is the No. 1 issue of the day when it comes to domestic policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, as we talk about the housing crisis, the subprime mortgage crisis, hopefully, our economy will work through this difficulty with the collective efforts of the White House and Congress. But, frankly, I am worried the most that unless Congress acts to lift the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf, the oil shale, and other sources of oil here at home, then it will be high gasoline and high energy prices that will plunge our Nation into a recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As bad as people feel the economy is going right now, I believe it can only get worse, unless Congress acts responsibly to deal with the causes of high gas prices. It is within our grasp to have a positive impact and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important for the American people to understand that the consequences of the last election in 2006 meant that the Democrats--our friends on the other side of the aisle--are in charge. As the Senator from Tennessee mentioned, it is Senator Reid, the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, who controls floor time. We cannot bring things up on the floor of the Senate unless he says it is OK. What we are doing here today is imploring him to get to work--to allow us to get  to work on the Nation's business when it comes to bringing down the price of gas at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is some good news: After 145 days of delay and going dark listening to foreign terrorists, because we hadn't reauthorized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, we were able to get a bipartisan compromise and pass that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here, again, this is where the majority party, the Democrats, control the agenda and, frankly, we are seeing unnecessary delays that were causing harm not only to our intelligence gathering, but also it has been 603 days  since the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has been stalled. This is an example where my State sells $2.3 billion of produce from our farmers and manufactured goods to Colombia. They bear a tariff that would be removed if that trade agreement  were to go through, which would create additional markets and help create jobs and improve the economy not only in Texas but across the country. If we can persuade Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid to allow this thing to go through, we can see a boost in our economy as a result of that free trade agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, of course, there is the matter of judicial nominees who have been blocked because of the unwillingness of the majority leader to allow them to have a vote on the Senate floor. It has been 748 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to talk about this last figure, and that is the 814 days since Speaker Pelosi said, in anticipation of the 2006 election:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Democrats get elected and if I become speaker, we are going to have a commonsense plan to bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was when gasoline prices were $2.33 a gallon. We thought gas prices were high then. What are they today? They are an average of $4.11 a gallon. We are still waiting for that plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are here to ask, in the most respectful way we know how, for the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, who controls the floor of the Senate, to bring a bill to the floor that will allow us to deal with this national economic crisis and provide some relief to the hard-working families in Texas and across the Nation who need some help. We know that high energy prices not only impact the quality of life and the economic welfare of hard-working people in my State and across the country,  it has a ripple effect on the price of food and other commodities, which is driving up inflation and threatening our economy. So we need some action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was somewhat amused to hear the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, come to the floor yesterday and talk about the need to "act more and talk less." Act more and talk less. I agree with the slogan, but I wish the majority leader and our friends on the other side of the aisle, who are in control of the agenda of the Senate, would take their own advice: Act more, talk less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what is necessary in order to deal with the energy crisis in this country. Here is what we have encountered: Nothing but obstruction. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is our leader on energy issues. He is the ranking member, and former chairman, of the Senate Committee on Energy. He has been an unparalleled advocate of the expansion of nuclear power to generate electricity in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens when we ask our friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us to try to expand the availability of cheap electricity through nuclear power in a safe way? It is blocked. What are we told, regarding our 300-year supply of coal in this country, that we want to invest money in clean coal technology and to use that energy in a way that protects the environment but generates electricity to be used by the American people? We are told, "no, you cannot do that either" by the majority  party. When it comes to offshore exploration, taking advantage of the God-given natural resources America has been blessed with, we are told, "no, you cannot do that either," even though it is within the power of the Congress to lift the ban that was imposed by the Congress, which would allow us to explore and produce oil from the submerged lands around our shoreline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President lifted the executive ban a couple of days ago. So the only barrier to the production of more of America's natural resources here at home in the submerged lands off our coastline is the Congress. Our friends on the other side of the aisle are in charge, and we are imploring them to work with us to produce more American energy. We have heard a lot about the oil shale out in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. About 2 million additional barrels of oil a day, we are told, could be produced  from that oil shale. But we are told, "no, you cannot do that." That was Congress that imposed that ban last year on developing the oil shale, which could relieve some of that pain at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, of course, we know about ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. When Congress actually passed legislation that would allow exploration and production of oil in ANWR, President Clinton vetoed it about 10 years ago. If he hadn't vetoed that legislation, we would have about a million barrels a day on line that would help with supply and would bring down the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the new energy policy of our friends on the other side of the aisle seems to be a "no energy" policy. It is not "let's do this instead of that"; it is just "no new energy." Now we are told that the majority leader wants to bring a bill to the floor to focus on speculation in the commodities market. We favor an examination of the commodities futures market, more transparency, and more cops on the beat in order to make sure the American people are being well served by the commodities futures  market. But it is not the only problem we need to deal with. We need to deal with the law of supply and demand, which, amazingly, Congress is under the misimpression that it can suspend the law of supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know, because we have been told by the world's experts, that we are in competition with growing economies, such as China and India, with more than a billion people each, who are buying cars and using more energy because they want the prosperity that comes along with more energy use. China's GDP is growing at 10 percent a year. It is building about two new coal-powered plants a week in that country. So we know we are in a global competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You would think that common sense would tell us, from a national security standpoint and from the standpoint of bolstering our economy here at home and producing additional supply, which will give us temporary relief as we transit that bridge Senator Domenici talks about to a clean energy future--we know in the long run we are going to have to get off of an oil-based energy dependency. Frankly, there is not enough of it for us to permanently continue where we are now. That is why alternative  sources of energy are important and why it is important that we conserve and, as Senator Alexander said, "find more, use less."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in Tyler, TX, last week, at Brookshire Groceries, which is a chain there. They were talking about how they had retrofitted their tractor-trailer rigs and tried to find ways to conserve and use less diesel. They told me how they had retrofitted their tractor-trailer rigs to try to conserve and use less diesel. They found, also, that if they drove their trucks at about 62 miles an hour, they could maximize the range that they could travel--the distance--and minimize the consumption of diesel.  If I am not mistaken, I think they told me they were able to save roughly 20 percent of their diesel consumption by finding ways to conserve. So we support the concept of using less, but we need to find more at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes sense that we produce more here in America. It will create jobs at a time when our economy is flying into a headwind right here in America, all across the country. It will bring some relief to consumers at the pump. We know that 70 percent of the price of gasoline is directly tied to the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to "act more and talk less," I agree. But it is up to the majority leader to allow us to act by bringing an energy bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a privilege this morning to follow after two Republicans who have eloquently expressed their views on this subject. I compliment our conference chairman from Tennessee, Senator Lamar Alexander. He has quickly taken the lead in this area as conference chairman and is doing an excellent job of putting us in a position where we can explain to the American people what this issue really is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 2 1/2  months ago, I introduced a bill. The bill was intended to call to the Senate's attention that we ought to be producing oil and gas  from U.S. assets, this oil and gas to be used by the American people to lessen our demand on foreign oil so that as we move across the bridge to the next fuel the world uses, we use less crude oil from foreign sources by using our own. That was the gist of the bill. It had conservation in it. It had  production in it. It had addressed the continental offshore exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, after 2 1/2  months, nothing has been done except that the President of the United States intervened and said to the American people: Let's just put the blame right where it belongs. I am lifting the Executive moratorium on all of the coastline of America in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that abuts our country. I am lifting the ones I have control over. And, Congress, you do what is next; you lift yours so we can begin the orderly process of having leases and producing oil and gas from  our property for our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot tell you how thrilled this Senator was with the President's action because it said: What is next? I can almost envision the minds of those who are in the business of holding us hostage to natural gas and crude oil we have to purchase from overseas, in particular crude oil. I can almost envision them peeking over and peeking down into the Congress of the United States, saying: Now it is your turn; we are wondering what you are going to do. Those who are holding us hostage are wondering:  Is the United States going into another deep sleep?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a 27-year deep sleep by America on these very valuable resources that should be explored on our coastlines which we own--we, the people, own--and we should get to work on a program to see how much of that we can use and where is it and how many billions of barrels there are. Make no bones about it, it should have been inventoried in depth, but it has not been. For a long time, people were scared to do that because they did not want to hear the results. Lately, the administration  did not want to do it because they didn't know if Congress would ever let us use it. So we have just cursory inventories, but they indicate that 20 billion barrels is a pretty good number to consider as the barrels we will probably get from offshore America. I am somewhat</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As those foreign countries peek over, they are doing two things: they are peeking at us to see what we will do, and they are also peeking at us to see whether we are going to let this asset go dormant or are we going to put it into the pool so that the psychology of what is available to the world will work its will and bring the price of oil down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise again today to speak on the most important economic and energy issue of our time. America faces a grave and growing threat from our massive dependence on foreign oil. We are told by lead economists for the International Energy Agency that we face a "dangerous situation" and that at today's pace, our global suppliers of oil will fail to meet demand over the next 25 years. We hear our businesses deeply concerned about fuel costs, and we hear the American people clamoring for new energy  supplies in the wake of $4-plus gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amidst all of this noise, from the majority in Congress we get a deafening silence. In fact, I think some on the other side of the aisle were hoping that this whole thing could disappear until after the election, that they wouldn't have to vote on what they want to do with the American people's assets--to wit, the offshore oil and gas reserves that are theirs, that have been locked up, as I said, for 27 years. I think sometimes the other side of the aisle--at least some of them--and the leadership  would think: Let's just wait until after the election, and then we will solve the problem and we won't have the Republicans in the way here. They can't do that because this is the Senate. An energy bill has to come up. We have to have amendments to it, and we have to vote. We will be looking anxiously and waiting anxiously for that to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken recently about the need to build a bridge to a clean energy future of affordable, reliable alternative energy fuel. The foundations of that bridge for the next three or four decades will be built on our Nation's use of crude oil. I hate to say that, but I have thought it through, and no matter what we do, no matter how successful we are, we are going to have to use crude oil until we find a total substitute for the automobiles and the trucks of today. They are the big users. We  cannot just pile them up and throw them away. They are going to be used. As they are used, we must have crude oil. So we are going to be dependent, and we have to find our way to bridge that with as much of it as we can produce at home. I have spoken about this and the fact that may be three or four decades. It is very important that everybody understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A growing majority of the American people are clamoring for us to explore for more homegrown energy. When you consider that an increasing number of Americans across all political ideological spectrum support more oil production at home, the Senate's silence on this issue is rather shocking. It is past time that the majority in the Senate respond to the clarion call of the overwhelming majority of Americans. It is time for leadership. The American people are calling for solutions, and they are  getting excuses. They are growing disillusioned by the inactions of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken at great length on this Senate floor about the fallacy of the so-called "use it or lose it" argument. I want to do that one more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hear many Members of this body accusing others of sitting on leases. But perhaps we should point this bright perspective light back on ourselves. With the Executive moratorium now lifted, Congress is solely responsible for locking up billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. Perhaps it is the American people who will tell us: Use it or lose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a comprehensive report by the National Petroleum Council called "Facing the Hard Truth About Energy," in the United States an estimated 40 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil resources are completely off limits or are subject to significant lease restrictions. That is more than the equivalent of 8 years of total U.S. imports at current rates. On the Atlantic and Pacific OCS alone, there is estimated to be 15 billion barrels of oil. That is more than the total Persian  Gulf imports over the past 15 years and approximately the same amount of the total oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico in the past half century. There are abundant oil reserves there waiting to be drilled, waiting to be explored, waiting for American ingenuity and talent which is now in abundance, and it is best to act on it because it is ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These figures are staggering, and in light of the fact that our estimates have historically been very low when we get to actual exploration and production, perhaps we should take the time and resources to pay for a very comprehensive inventory. Then we would know how much there is out there. The American people would be even more excited about the prospects of that vast resource which is theirs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staggering as the numbers are, they do not include the 800 billion barrels of oil-equivalent oil shale located in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. By the conservative estimates of the RAND Corporation, our oil shale resources at the base is three times greater than the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The facts are clear: We are spending hundreds of billions of American dollars to purchase something from around the world that we have sitting under our feet. As gasoline exceeds $4 a gallon and oil hovers around $140 per barrel, the American people should be tired of excuses. I believe they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amidst this backdrop, it is stunning that the majority  offers a simple speculation bill. Every serious expert--from Daniel Yergin, to Guy Caruso, to Ben Bernanke, and Warren Buffett--recognizes it is a supply-demand problem and not a speculation problem. We are glad to debate the issue, but we better put some other things before the Senate, not just that, if we intend for the American people to believe we care about their plight and the plight of the American economy today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all that is going on that is scaring the American people, I personally believe the biggest culprit in the crowd is the growing dependence on crude oil, the amount of money we send overseas  every hour, every day, every week, every month to countries, many of which are our enemies and could care less about us, that we must pay that to get crude oil to be refined so that we can move our automobiles and our trucks and do our work and our business every  day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It sounds incredible that we would not join together, Democrats and Republicans, on this exciting day and say we finally have pulled back the curtain that has had a blackout imposed on offshore drilling in America and join hands and say: What do we do to begin to develop it as quickly as we can? I don't see why we ought to be arguing. We ought to do it together and quickly. That is what the American people would like. I don't think that is what we are going to get. I hope some Democrats will  be listening. That is what this Senator would like to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a bill. We have a proposal. It would probably be better if Democrats and Republicans had one together that both produced and conserved, that produced more oil and conserved more in terms of our automobiles by producing more electric cars. Just combine those--this one, and match it off against another one--and we will be moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close by saying I hope that day comes. I hope the other side is not waiting, doing nothing until the election is over, using any excuse they would like. There is no excuse. We can do it, and we ought to do it now. The curtain has now rolled back. The offshore is there to look at, to see, and it contains billions of barrels of oil that are ours. We ought to go get it in an orderly way, and we ought to pass laws in a bipartisan way that permit us to do it. But if not, we ought to put forth ours  and have some serious votes in front of the American people to decide our future.</paragraph>
