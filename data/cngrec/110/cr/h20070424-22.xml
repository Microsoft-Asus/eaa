  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week Congress will vote on an emergency war spending conference report that fully funds the war and our troops, and yet the President is still threatening a veto. The President's problem with the bill is Congress' strong message that we are not going to allow the war to go on indefinitely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In years past, the President has dealt with Republican-controlled Congresses, which simply rubber-stamped his requests, despite countless mistakes in Iraq. Last November, the American people demanded a change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month the Congress acted and brought a serious change to our policy in Iraq. We demanded that the Iraqi Government meet the political and economic benchmarks that the President himself outlined earlier this year and set timelines for withdrawal if those benchmarks are not met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Defense Secretary Gates himself, last week, said that the timelines we passed here in Congress and the pressure that our legislation exerts on the Iraqi Government is having a positive impact. Our legislation is already impacting the events in Iraq. The President should allow this to continue by reconsidering his threat to veto the legislation.</paragraph>
