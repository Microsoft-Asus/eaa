  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>You know, the United States is a Nation founded on the rule of law. Those who do not follow the law are held accountable, except when you are an illegal immigrant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already learned that a few of our major banks are issuing credit cards to illegal immigrants, but a recent article in the L.A. Times uncovered a program through our own Federal Reserve Bank that makes it easier for illegal entrants to send money back to Mexico, direct to Mexico. A federally sponsored program allows illegal immigrants without a Social Security number to wire money through the Federal system for a fee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is even more shocking is that the Fed expanded the program that allows anyone, illegal or not, to open accounts at participating banks. This is a big business. We have learned it is 27,000 transfers from illegal immigrants every month, totaling $23 billion a year, all with the help of our Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are sending mixed messages, Mr. Speaker. We say we want to stem the tide of illegal immigration, but once again, here we go. We will not only turn a blind eye; we will make it easy for illegal immigrants to send money back to Mexico.</paragraph>
