  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the special environmental achievements of a vibrant small business located in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Southco, a manufacturer of access hardware, has reduced the amount of hazardous waste it generates from more than 3,200 pounds in 2002 to zero just 3 years later in 2005. Through systematic changes in their manufacturing process, they have completely ceased producing hazardous waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, Southco has committed to reducing its consumption of electricity by 15 percent over the next 3 years. Clearly Southco is a role model for our Nation's businesses when it comes to preserving our precious resources. There is a lot of talk about environmental conservation and energy independence, but through innovative thinking, Southco has delivered tangible results in the private sector and provided an excellent example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, the Environmental Protection Agency has made Southco a member of its National Environmental Performance Track Program, designed to honor leaders who have demonstrated a commitment to reducing their negative impact on the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to personally thank Southco for being an excellent corporate citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Southco is a leader in these efforts, and deserves our praise for its forward-thinking, socially conscious practices.</paragraph>
