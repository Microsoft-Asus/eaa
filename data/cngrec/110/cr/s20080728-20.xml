    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was unavoidably detained during rollcall vote No. 187, a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of <bill type="s" number="3186">S. 3186</bill>, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance bill. Had I been present I would have voted "nay" and I ask that the Congressional Record reflect that.</paragraph>
