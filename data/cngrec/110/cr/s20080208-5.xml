  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks today, the Senate will be back on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under an order previously entered, all amendments must be debated with all time used today or Monday. There will be no rollcall votes today or Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to tell everyone there is a lot of time left on the FISA legislation--8 hours or so, according to how you add it up; some say 6. People are going to have to do it today or Monday or the time will be gone and we are going to complete voting on this on Tuesday. It could be a long Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will finish this work period with some other things we have to accomplish. Next week, we have a number of things we are going to try to accomplish and then we are out a week and then we are back for 3 weeks and then we are out for a couple weeks. And then we are here for 8 weeks. There is a lot to do both here and at home. I hope we have a productive day on Monday.</paragraph>
