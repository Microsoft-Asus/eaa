    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Speaker, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for the formal notification of the Congress that he presented earlier to the House of Representatives, and thank him for bringing us this opportunity to express our sadness over the passing of our colleague, TOM LANTOS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and my colleagues, yesterday morning when I received the very sad news of Chairman Lantos's passing, that call was followed very quickly by a call from the President of the United States expressing to me as Speaker, but through me to each and every one of you, his sadness over TOM's passing and his words of praise for TOM LANTOS's leadership. I told the President how appreciative I knew we would all be of his kind words and that I would convey them to this  House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you know that the House, not only the House, the Congress, the country, has lost one of its most talented leaders, and the world, indeed the world, has lost one of its greatest champions for human rights with the passing of Chairman TOM LANTOS. He was a statesman, he was a gentleman, and he will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress, TOM LANTOS devoted his public life to shining a bright light on the dark corners of oppression. From his earliest days in the House, when he founded with Congressman JON PORTER the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, to his final days as  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he used his powerful voice to stir the consciousness of world leaders and the public alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because he had lost his mother and so much of his family in the Holocaust, his wife, Annette, his two daughters, Annette and Katrina, his grandchildren and great grandchildren were the center of his universe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I told some of our colleagues earlier that TOM and Annette were a team in every way. Whether it was establishing the Human Rights Caucus or working together for the benefit of his district and our country, they were a team. And all who knew TOM knew how devoted he was to his family and to Annette, whom he adored. They worked as a team, bringing great intellect, experience, and compassion to their outstanding work in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Annette was alone after the Holocaust as well, and when they married, they had two daughters, Annette and Katrina, who produced this wonderful family of 18 grandchildren. Two daughters, 18 grandchildren. They said to their parents, you lost your families in the Holocaust. We are bringing to you a new family. And how proud TOM was for all of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having lived the worst evil known to mankind, TOM LANTOS translated his experience into a lifetime commitment to the fight against anti-Semitism, for Holocaust education, and commitment to the State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM LANTOS was not only a champion of human rights. He was an expert on foreign affairs and diplomacy and the security of our country. He had a rare combination of extraordinary knowledge, great wisdom, extraordinary skill and judgment, and a great moral compass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He rallied us to the cause of defending basic human freedom within the borders of the most powerful countries and in the most remote places in the world. He stood tall in the sometimes lonely fight for the people of China and Tibet. I was proud that we had the opportunity to work together, with the President of the United States in a bipartisan way, to honor the people of Tibet by presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama last year. TOM, along with Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen,  were coauthors of that legislation. Thank you, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He fought to end the genocide in Darfur and recently helped enact legislation to crack down on the Sudanese regime. He worked to strengthen sanctions against the military junta in Burma and worked for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. In just his first year as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Lantos also helped enact the 9/11 Commission recommendations to better protect the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his three decades in the House, TOM LANTOS always used his experience and intellect to empower the powerless and give voice to the voiceless throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here at home, TOM LANTOS championed working families. Working families had no better friend in the Congress of the United States than TOM LANTOS, and he was a strong leader in protecting our family for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also authored key provisions of our landmark energy bill, which the President signed into law. Thanks to TOM LANTOS, that law includes provisions that will help the United States assume a greater leadership role in the world to fight climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will long be remembered for his efforts to expand and protect the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which is one of the Nation's most visited national parks and a treasure for Bay Area residents. I had the privilege of serving with TOM as we shared representation of the City of San Francisco, and it was one of the privileges of my service in Congress, to work with him on behalf of the people of San Francisco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Lantos was also well known for his strong support of infrastructure improvements, including the expansion of BART service and other mass transit solutions. Though his leadership was felt around the world, he always remained a fierce advocate for his constituents in the 12th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM LANTOS called himself "an American by choice." America is a stronger nation, a more caring nation, a nation more true to its founding ideals, because TOM LANTOS chose to call this land his home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers are with Annette, dear Annette, their daughters Katrina and Annette, his 18 grandchildren, and his great grandchildren. I hope it is a comfort to them that so many people throughout the entire world mourn their loss and are praying for them in this sad time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good-bye, TOM, my friend. It was an honor to call you colleague, a privilege to serve with you, and a joy to be your friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, TOM will be remembered as a passionate advocate for human rights around the world and a strong voice for better schools and a cleaner environment. The obituaries and my colleagues tonight will fill in many details and have much praise for the wonderful job that TOM did in his period here. I just tried to pick out a few things that he will be remembered for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Speaker mentioned, he worked to give a voice to the voiceless in Burma, Tibet, wherever oppression raised its ugly head. In Congress, as in life, he was a doer, a leader, a fighter. Two years ago, TOM was arrested in front of the Sudanese Embassy for protesting the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He swam every morning at 5:30 until recently. He was a man who enjoyed and lived life to its fullest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been mentioned, he is survived by a large and wonderful family he loved, and they loved him. Without saying, our sympathy goes to TOM's wife and childhood sweetheart, Annette, their two daughters, Annette and Katrina, and their many grandchildren and great grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To appreciate, I guess, all that TOM accomplished, we ought to think a little bit about his life before joining us here in Congress. He grew up in Hungary and survived Nazi labor camps. He arrived in the United States in 1947 on an academic scholarship. And at Customs, you think it is a problem to take off your shoes now, at customs he was greeted and they immediately confiscated his only possession, a Hungarian salami. So they were as thorough then as they are now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He married Annette in 1950, and he also received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics and then moved on to San Francisco. He received those at the University of Washington in Seattle. He moved to San Francisco and began a 30-year career teaching economics at San Francisco State. In 1953, he received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM was elected in 1980. Three years later he cofounded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, he announced to us that he had been diagnosed with cancer and would not seek reelection. In that announcement he said, and I quote him here, "I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, this House and our country will never be able to fully express our gratitude for TOM's decades of service. He will be missed by his colleagues, constituents, family, and the people whose basic human rights he fought for every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the balance of my time be controlled by the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as is very evident, this is a sad day and evening for the House of Representatives, and, of course, the Lantos family, and for all of the American people and all who are lovers of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Tom Lantos devoted his life to shining a bright light on dark corners of oppression." That was a quote from Speaker Pelosi in her official statement in responding to the tragic news of TOM's passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to quote Speaker Pelosi once again, Madam Speaker. "Tom Lantos devoted his life to shining a bright light on dark corners of oppression."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard that TOM LANTOS is the lone survivor of the Holocaust to ever serve in the Congress of the United States. We know of his tremendous accomplishments. We know the  fact that 58 years ago this coming July he and Annette were married. And we know that he had an absolutely wonderful family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His two daughters did provide those 18 grandchildren and two great grandchildren, and I have to say that I personally have had the opportunity to spend time with all of them. The reason is that I am one of Annette and TOM's neighbors here on Capitol Hill, and we always knew when the Lantos household was filled over at Justice Court, because kids were running around all over that area, and it was such a wonderful thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I heard the Speaker say today what TOM's daughters said to him, the fact that he lost his family in the Holocaust would lead them to provide him with a family that he no longer had, obviously they did. I have known of no parent or grandparent to be prouder of their children and grandchildren than Annette and TOM LANTOS have been of their wonderful family, and having heard Speaker Pelosi's words, I now have an even greater understanding of the importance of the role  that Annette and Katrina played in providing them with that family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We got the news I read this morning in the paper that just last week the Prime Minister of Hungary was scheduled to present TOM with the highest honor that Hungary bestows on anyone; and, sadly, he was too ill to receive that honor. But we know that TOM regularly described himself as one who was born Hungarian, but was American by choice; and I think that underscores the extraordinary importance of immigration and the great importance of what it is that has made the United States  of America as great as it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things, I am the first Republican to stand up but I am going to be turning this over to the distinguished ranking member on the Committee on Foreign Affairs in just a few minutes, but as the first Republican to stand up, I have to say that one of the greatest things about Tom Lantos is that he regularly transcended political party. He was known for the wonderful working relationship that he had with the former chairman of his committee who, as we all know, passed away sadly  last year, our colleague Henry Hyde.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I regularly, as a member of the Rules Committee, had the opportunity to see Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos come together, arm in arm, working together on behalf of a very positive foreign policy for the United States. Now, don't get me wrong, there were more than a couple of occasions, especially in the last couple of years, where there was disagreement between Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos. But time and time again, both men demonstrated their extraordinary patriotism and their commitment  to the greatness of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 2, just last month, our friend TOM announced that he would not be running for reelection. Of course, he had gotten the news of his illness. And in that statement announcing his retirement, Madam Speaker, he said, "It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family, and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a Member of the United States  Congress. I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, one of the things that I regularly say about the United States of America, and I think like most of the people who are here in this Chamber at this moment, we were born here; and people who were born here can have a tendency to take the greatness of the United States of America for granted. But I will say that Tom Lantos demonstrated fully, through every single aspect of his life, the profound appreciation that an immigrant has for something that many of us who are native  born have a tendency to take for granted. And I regularly fight against that, and seeing someone like Tom Lantos has played a big role in inspiring me. And I know there are other great immigrants who serve in this Congress and obviously in this country as well. And I think that his life underscores that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look over and see our distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, I am reminded of the great work that he did on the Helsinki Commission and, as has been stated on the issues that Mr. Stark raised, environment and other issues. But when it came to fighting on behalf of human rights, in 1983 Annette Lantos became the volunteer director of the Human Rights Caucus because of her extraordinary commitment to that cause. And, obviously, it was led by TOM through these so  many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will just say that for me, personally, I was elected with TOM in November of 1980, 28 years ago this coming November; and this is a professional loss, but obviously for so many of us, a very profound personal loss. And I want to say to all of the family members how much I have appreciated the friendship. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. And the world is a better place, the world clearly is a better place for the life of Tom Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) be able to manage the balance of our time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased and honored to yield to our majority leader 1 minute.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding. This is a sad day not only for this institution, for those of us who were Tom's friends, clearly for his family, but it is a sad day for our country. Tom Lantos had a backbone of steel and a heart of commitment, compassion, and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Dreier just mentioned my service on the Helsinki Commission. As chairman of that body for the House, with my friend Chris Smith, we shared responsibility for focusing on the human rights of people, particularly within the European theater and particularly in the Soviet Union, and we worked very hard at that. But no Member of this body has been a stronger voice, a more compelling voice for the rights of individuals, whatever their background, wherever they lived, and whatever  the excuse was for acting against them or undermining their rights. When Tom spoke, especially on matters dealing with human rights, America's role in the world, the importance of confronting and defeating dictatorial regimes, both the left and right, his words contained a moral clarity and intellectual gravity that was seldom matched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who had an opportunity to be with Tom when we met with people from around the world knew that Tom Lantos would be candid, diplomatic, but certain in his message. Tom, quite simply, was a man of great substance, an immigrant to America, like so many immigrants before him and after, but few matching his contribution to our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaker Pelosi indicated that Tom referred to himself as an American by choice. He was a great humanitarian. His remarkable life serves as an inspiration to all of us, to his family, and to his country. He was an indomitable spirit. His life story of course is well known, and I will not repeat it here. Others will talk more specifically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, Tom was unable to attend the United Nations Annual Commemoration of the Holocaust. However, his daughter Katrina, married to one of our colleagues, Dick Swett, delivered his remarks, which called on the international community to, and I quote, "dedicate ourselves to stopping current tragedies such as the genocide in Darfur, and to preventing such inhuman cruelty in the future."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions around this globe have lost an extraordinary voice for them, individually and collectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom went on to note that the "veneer of civilization is paper thin." That is a lesson for all of us. We know that the mob can be uncaring of human rights, of individuals. Tom Lantos focused on that issue when he said that that veneer is very thin. John Lewis, another great humanitarian and champion of individual rights and civil liberties. He went on to say, "We are its guardians, and we can never rest." Not only did he say that, but he lived his life without rest  for those he saw beleaguered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until his last day on this Earth, Tom Lantos never rested because of what he had seen and experienced. He was an indefatigable advocate for human  rights and human decency. And now with his passing it falls to us to honor his enduring legacy, not just by speaking on this floor of what he did, but committing ourselves to continue his advocacy for liberty and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no more fitting tribute to this wonderful man who lived a wonderful life marked by hardship, tragedy, and also triumph, and who now is at rest in God's hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I especially want to speak of Annette. You cannot speak of Tom Lantos without speaking of Annette. I don't know of any couple that I have ever met that was in fact, as well as in marriage-ceremony verbiage, two people who became one, kindred spirits born of equal experience, equally committed with a passion and a courage and an untiring commitment on behalf of those who needed a voice. Annette is with us still and, therefore, Tom is with us still. May we honor  him, remember him, and hold high the torch that he held so high, so successfully for so long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless you, Tom Lantos.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we gather in this hallowed place to honor the life and work of our beloved colleague, Tom Lantos, our sorrow at news of his death is tempered by our admiration for his extraordinary contributions to our great country. An unfailingly gracious and courageous man, Tom was recognized by colleagues as a leader who left an enviable legacy of service to our country. We were fortunate indeed to have known him. Annette and the entire Lantos family have our heartfelt condolences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom and Annette's heroic journey to America through extraordinary adversity is well known to us all and is the topic perhaps for a future biographer who can adequately capture the tenor of life under the oppressive yolk of fascism during those terrible times more than half a century ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom's unsurpassed work as a champion of human rights and for human dignity cannot be separated from his fiery trials through which he passed as a young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His life bears witness to the endurance of the human spirit. As a colleague, Tom enjoyed the respect of his peers across the political spectrum, because all of us admired him as an ardent American patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our many meetings together, when we met with foreign leaders here and abroad, his love of country was always evident. He understood an old truth that all of us would do well to relearn: united we stand, and divided we fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be sure, Tom could be a vehement critic of an administration policy during House debate. But he would not hesitate to remind a visiting group of European parliamentarians to temper their criticism of U.S. policy or risk being labeled as hypocrites for their feeble resistance to genocide at Auschwitz or at modern-day death camps in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His defense of the national security policies would surprise and perhaps rankle some, but not those of us who knew Tom as an unbeatable foe of Communist tyranny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us here tonight have so many stories to share about Tom, about his life with Annette, and his vital work; and we will surely honor him in the months ahead in other appropriate ways. It is fitting, though, that we honor the life of this great patriot, for it was his work and his life that enriched us. So tonight, rather than merely mourn his passing, let us thank God that Tom lived among us and left such a strong legacy for us to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I often said to Tom before our committee hearings that it was a great testament to a wonderful Nation that two naturalized citizens, witnesses to the evils of communism and oppression, would serve as chairman and ranking member of the committee charged with developing and overseeing our foreign policy efforts. And I cannot fully explain to Tom and his family my deep gratitude to Tom for his service and for his dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Annette, our prayers are with you and your family. And how odd to say, as Mr. Hoyer pointed out, how odd to say "Annette" without saying "Tom and Annette," for they were a unit. Thank you, Tom. Godspeed, my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to recognize for 2 minutes the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400289" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today in support of this resolution. Like all of my colleagues, I was deeply saddened to learn that our good friend, the distinguished gentleman from California, Tom Lantos, had passed away. And he was our good friend, unfailingly courteous and kind and helpful to all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom has left an inspiring legacy, and his passing is a great loss to our country and to the entire world. Throughout his life, Tom devoted himself to human rights and to the cause of persecuted racial, religious, and ethnic minorities. As a survivor of the Holocaust, and the only survivor ever to serve in Congress, he had seen firsthand real evil, and he became a tireless advocate for human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a youth, he was a member of the anti-Nazi underground, and his life's work was built on opposing anti-Semitism and all forms of racism and oppression and attempted genocide, and on supporting Israel, the country that emerged as the haven for the survivors and refugees from the Holocaust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Lantos once said, "I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country." But it is this Nation that will never be able to express adequately its gratitude to this great man. His life and devotion to human rights should serve as an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers, our thoughts and prayers, and those of a grateful Nation, are with Annette and with the rest of Tom's family and friends during this sad time. And in this hour of bereavement, as we mourn the loss of this great man, what can we finally say other than to thank God for Tom's life and work, and to repeat that ancient refrain, "The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a member of our Foreign Affairs Committee, and someone who worked so closely with Chairman Lantos on human rights issues worldwide.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Florida for her yielding and for her very eloquent remarks, and for all of the fine statements that have been made on behalf of Chairman Tom Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as I think we all know, Chairman Lantos was one of the most gifted, articulate, smart, persuasive, and compassionate, and, I would add, courageous Members of Congress ever to serve. Over the years, I, like so many other colleagues here in this Chamber, got to know and deeply respect and honor this great man. We traded places as chairman and ranking member of the International Human Rights Subcommittee and worked seamlessly on North Korea, Sudan, human trafficking, child  labor, Jewish Refusniks, and China, just to name a few of the very difficult issues that were confronted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1980s, Mr. Lantos played a significant role in dismantling atheistic communism in Eastern Europe, including his native Hungary, as well as in the Soviet Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Holocaust survivor, Tom Lantos had a special, well-focused empathy for those who suffered torture, degrading, or inhumane treatment. He was especially vocal and determined when it came to liberating political prisoners, and was a champion on behalf of the Dalai Lama and Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos was bold and he was incisive with both friend and foe alike, more often I am happy to say with the latter. In confronting dictatorship, he refused to allow the banalities and excessive niceties of modern-day diplomacy to obscure his clear and compelling message concerning freedom, democracy, and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of anti-Semitism, he had no equal. In the days immediately prior to the infamous September 11 attacks on America, Tom Lantos brilliantly defended both the United States and Israel at the U.N. racism conference held in Durban, South Africa, a  world conference that deteriorated into an anti-Semitic hatefest. His insights and recommendations are of particular importance and relevance as the United Nations gears up for what is likely  to be Durban II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He wrote at the time, "For me, having experienced the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand, this was the most sickening and unabashed display of hate for Jews I have seen since the Nazi period."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on, however, in a positive vein to say, "The U.S. must urge friendly Middle Eastern countries to recognize the link between hate-mongering and violence. Arab states, meanwhile, need to look deeply within themselves, analyze their missteps, cease the inflammatory lies, and embrace the path of openness and political reform, realizing their citizens' positive energy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to say, "We cannot defeat terrorism if our coalition partners continue to peddle the hate that breeds it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Cold War ended with the collapse of international communism, but in the resulting vacuum, radical forces bent on spreading fundamentalist ideologies have arisen, propelled by the very globalization developments they often sustain. The U.N. World Conference on Racism provided the world with a glimpse into the abyss of international hate, discrimination, and indeed, racism. The terrorist attacks on September 11 demonstrated the evil such hate can spawn. If we are to prevail in our war against  terrorism, we must take to heart the lessons of Durban."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vintage Tom Lantos, and as always, a man who was almost like a prophet, speaking boldly, incisively, and with great clarity. Finally, I want to say, Madam Speaker, that my wife, Marie, and I will deeply miss our dear friend Tom Lantos, and our prayers are with and for Annette and his family at this most difficult period of time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I recognize for 2 1/2  minutes Tom's colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, and to all of the Members of the House, I rise this evening with a sad heart. The first thing I want to say is to offer my special condolences to Annette Lantos, the love of Tom's life, actually as has been said earlier this morning, childhood sweethearts, to his two exceptional daughters, to his son-in-laws, 18 grandchildren and two great grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Tom Lantos for many decades, long before I came to the House of Representatives. And I remember that November of 1980 where I think he was the only Democrat that won in challenging a Republican. It was a real upset in the 12th Congressional District. And so tonight I am thinking about the people of the 12th Congressional District because they not only handed him a victory, he never forgot it, and he used his public service to fulfill the great responsibility and the charge  that they gave to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our congressional districts are next door to one another. Tom always said that he stood between the Speaker and myself because his congressional district was between ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos was truly a gentleman. He was a gentleman with old world manners. He was a scholar. He taught economics. When he spoke, everyone knew he was scholarly, and so the old term "a scholar and a gentleman" really belonged to Tom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an immigrant, and I think, during these times when immigrants are not fully appreciated, that Tom Lantos should remind us of what comes to this country in terms of immigrants. He came here, as he said, penniless, but he came here and brought his hopes and aspirations. Who would have thought when Tom Lantos came through Customs and the Immigration Service that he would one day come to the House of Representatives and, in the day after he died, that all of these accolades  that he so is deserving of would be said about him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A poet wrote, "And so he passed on, and then all the trumpets sounded on the other side." God rest your soul, Tom. Thank you for what you have given to America and thank you for what you did in the House of Representatives. Thank you for what you did for the people of the 12th Congressional District. We are forever grateful.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to a good man and a cherished colleague. Chairman Lantos was one of those most respected and distinguished Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and he will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his 14 terms in this body, he championed the causes of people everywhere who face oppression and cruelty. Through his leadership of both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Human Rights Caucus, he guided U.S. policy with morality and integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I listened to Ms. Eshoo, she used the same words as I would say of him. He was truly a gentleman, one of those rare breeds of old world statesmen who brings clarity and respect to our national debate. And while he was indeed an accomplished speaker, Chairman Lantos inspired not only by his words but by his own personal story. I think we will all remember him standing here in this Chamber, straight rail posture, and saying "after you, my dear," always the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his tragic experiences in the Nazi camps to his rise in Congress, he showed how one truly remarkable individual can overcome the worst sort of tyranny and achieve great things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to Chairman Lantos's wife and daughters and grandchildren and great grandchildren, I send my thoughts and prayers. We can all take comfort in the fact that he had a full life with a legacy that will never be forgotten.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400191" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I can't match the eloquent statements about TOM that have been made by my colleagues; but I thought I might share just a few thoughts that came to my mind, not only today, but every day that I saw TOM LANTOS. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, he was a guy of extreme competence. And if you wanted to get to the heart of a matter quickly, and you wanted to probe a situation in foreign affairs quickly, or a matter of national policy, and you had a national leader, international leader in front of you, and TOM LANTOS was asking questions, he did a great cross-examination. And he brought the facts out very quickly. But, you know, lots of people can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were some special qualities that TOM LANTOS had that reflected and illuminated his life and always impressed me every time I saw him. One was his great dignity. He walked in dignity. And it wasn't a pride; it wasn't an egotistical thing. It was a respect for his fellow man that emanated from him and seemed to illuminate the room when he walked in, and when he took his place, and when he asked questions, and when he worked on these important issues of the day.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H855]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man of great principle. And, Madam Speaker, I think that it must surprise many folks who watch this, watch the leadership in this Nation, and look at this Capitol, look at this body, in this city, where so much talent is focused on powerful national interests, that we have leaders like TOM LANTOS, perhaps the finest leaders, the ones with the greatest talents, who focus those talents not on powerful interests or the protection of those interests, but, in fact, on the interests  of those who have no station, who have no money, and in many cases have no hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think that's a great trademark of this Nation and certain special leaders, like TOM LANTOS, that gives us, gives this country respect from those around the world, not just people who live in places of power or who occupy places of power in foreign governments, but all those around the world who look at this American forum here, this forum of leadership and governance in Washington, DC, and who saw people like TOM LANTOS, perhaps tough to figure out in many ways, but when it  got right down to it, they understood that in this country, the dignity, the value of human beings is still very central to this wonderful country that we call America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it's with a lot of sadness that I see TOM LANTOS, a guy who came in the same year I came in, in 1980, along with Mr. Dreier, leave us. And I just hope that we all look at that model now and again when we have tough and difficult times, because the last great quality that TOM LANTOS had was conciliation. And you could have fierce fights on issues, and yet he had that wonderful quality of being able to reconcile with his adversaries and find common ground in the next great  issue that was before you.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400371" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we're all deeply saddened by the passing of TOM LANTOS. He not only made history here in Washington; he embodied history, having survived the Holocaust. And he didn't just survive the Nazis; he fought them in the anti-Nazi underground during World War II. His personal history added to the gravitas of everything he said and everything he did here in Washington. TOM was our Nation's most passionate, eloquent, and respected advocate for human rights, for  democracy and for freedom. TOM never bowed to political pressure in the face of any humanitarian atrocity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our friend, GARY ACKERMAN, pointed out, in a town with too many sheep, TOM LANTOS was a lion, for Darfur, for Tibet, wherever human rights were trampled. And of course TOM LANTOS led the walk out in 2001 from the Durban South Africa U.N. conference when that conference degenerated into an anti-Semitic hatefest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I came here as a tax professional expecting to serve on the Ways and Means Committee someday. And when that day arrived, TOM LANTOS convinced me to stay involved instead on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He convinced me with his words, but more than that he convinced me with his example. He was courteous, gracious, beyond what you expect; but more than that, he was passionate and he was eloquent. And he was an example of what it is to be a great advocate for human  rights here in Congress. He will indeed be missed, not only by Annette and the entire LANTOS family, but also by people around the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what a privilege it is to join my colleagues today in paying tribute to our fellow Californian, the Honorable TOM LANTOS, who so wonderfully represented his constituents during his three decades in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know now, TOM LANTOS' journey from Hungary to the Halls of Congress was an extremely remarkable one. His life told the story of the fulfillment of the American Dream. He embodied that dream and, equally important, he knew not to take what America offered him for granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even as he rose to leadership, he continued to champion the cause of human rights for oppressed people around the world, his signature issue. He was fiercely loyal to those attributes of this Nation, which had attracted him here to the country he chose to become a citizen of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who of us will forget TOM LANTOS' first action, becoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, holding some of his first hearings as chairman to address the human rights violations occurring today in Darfur?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By never forgetting his own roots, he became an advocate for all the lessons of humanity that we needed to learn from the experiences of the Holocaust, never forgetting that he served here as one who had survived that terrible tragedy and dedicated, as he was, to seeing that it would never reoccur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made sure that we all knew, and such a lesson I have, that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I learned so much from my colleague, TOM LANTOS. I can just see him sitting in his regular spot there. So our heartfelt condolences are extended to Annette, to the children, to the 18 grandchildren, one of whom I had the privilege of hearing as she testified to our Health Subcommittee. Beautiful opera singer. TOM was so proud of her. Courageous enough to talk about her rare health condition.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to honor the courageous life of our dear friend and colleague, Chairman TOM LANTOS. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply saddened by the loss of Chairman Lantos, and I would like to first offer my deepest condolences to Annette, his family, friends and staff, and of course California's 12th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have to thank Mrs. Lantos and TOM's entire family for sharing this great human being with the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Lantos was an exceptional human being, and we're hearing much of this tonight. But I've always said, To know him was to love him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His life embodied the true meaning of courage and the power of the human spirit. As the sole member of his family to survive the Holocaust, Chairman Lantos made it his life's mission, and we all know it was his life's mission, to fight for the oppressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his years in Congress he fought tirelessly to ensure human rights issues always had an important and visible place within these Halls. And as the founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, he continually reminded us that combating injustice anywhere and everywhere in the world was not only the right thing to do, but it was our duty as elected representatives of the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege to work alongside this giant of a human being on so many issues. As a former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for 8 years, we worked together on a number of issues that we both cared passionately about, including legislation to combat the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, to end the genocide in Darfur, to address the needs of orphans and vulnerable children, and, of course, to end the occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will always remember the respect, and his wisdom and his insight and his guidance, as he helped me navigate the legislative process with the late Chairman Henry Hyde on the HIV/AIDS legislation. I imagine that they are, at this moment, renewing their wonderful friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will also miss our personal conversations, especially about his grandchildren, my grandchildren, his great grandchildren. He knew all of their names, and he knew all of their birth dates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we have to remember TOM loved animals; his deceased Gigi and of course now Chippy. I mean, it was amazing that this giant of a human being was such a gentle man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that we must rededicate ourselves to TOM's life. His spirit is in us, and I will miss him. I will miss his love. May he rest in peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a new Member of Congress, TOM LANTOS took me under his wings. He was my chairman of the Labor and Health Subcommittee of the Government Reform Committee, and I was one of its most active members. I got to know this man up close, and I know no one like him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM LANTOS adored his wife, Annette, his two magnificent daughters, Annette and Katrina, and all of his glorious grandchildren and now great-grandchildren. He simply adored them all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Holocaust survivor, TOM LANTOS could not be intimidated by anyone. He was brilliant, passionate, courageous, tough almost to the point, let's face it, of being brutal, but he was also kind, gentle, loving, and lots of fun. He had a great sense of humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM was the most eloquent person I have ever known. It was hard sometimes not to feel inadequate in his presence, but the fact is, he would never have wanted you to feel that way. He would always make me feel like the best was always ahead of me and that I should think big thoughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a natural teacher. He taught by example and by the questions he asked, and he expected you to grow and to be a better person. That was your duty. And your duty, also, was to be of service to others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that TOM and Annette were both, are both, very strong-willed people. I marvel at how they were able to be such a powerful team and raise such a truly unbelievable, fantastic, magnificent family. They were, and are, an awesome couple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM LANTOS loved America. And yes TOM LANTOS adored his wife, Annette. He adored his two daughters, Annette and Katrina, adored his grandchildren, adored his great-grandchildren. And you could be his friend if you were willing to listen to him talk about all of his loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But woe be to any man that sought to marry his daughters or his granddaughters. They were mere mortals. He expected more for his daughters and granddaughters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say his son-in-laws, his grandson-in-laws, are very brave souls. Can you imagine going up to TOM and saying, "I would like to marry your daughter"? That would take true courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, granddaughters-in-law were another story. They were deemed worthy. He embraced them immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope, I truly hope and pray Congress finds a way to immortalize this great man in important legislation that will forever bear his name. We have Pell grants, and Fulbright Scholars. Those are names that I have heard almost all of my life. TOM LANTOS deserves to have this kind of recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM LANTOS believed in smart power for this country. He advocated a strong military, wise diplomacy, and strategic use of economic power. But TOM wasn't just a great man of this Nation. He was a great man in this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say it slightly differently. He is a great man of this Nation. He is a great man of this world. His light will be forever and we cannot forget him.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to add my remarks to those of my colleagues, but I have got some personal things to tell you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, he had that compassionate spirit. His unwavering concern for individual human rights and his deep knowledge of the world were an inspiration to us all. I remember when my predecessor passed away, I got a call at my embassy saying that if you should come to Congress, there is a place on Foreign Affairs for you. I hadn't even said I was going to come. Well, the results were I did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sit with honor among my colleagues on Foreign Affairs. I had the privilege to be trained at the State Department twice with his son-in-law, one of those rare specimens of humanity that he allowed to marry Katrina, his daughter. And I said to TOM after Katrina in Louisiana, "I'm so sorry that Katrina has to go around through life after this terrible, terrible hurricane and present herself as `Katrina.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "She's strong like I am. She can survive."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I knew that when he called on me to lead the delegation to Italy, something that he looked forward to every year to continue our dialogue with Great Britain, I knew something was not right, but that proud, distinguished, tall-standing human being never uttered a word. And so I kind of knew something was up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I got back, I said to him, "Thank you for the honor of going to Portofino and leading the group in your place." He said, "Ambassador, you deserve that," and never said another word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then he called us together and he said, "Travel, learn what is happening around this globe." And that is what we are doing. We are carrying on his legacy by learning the world, knowing it the way he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will certainly miss this giant of a human being.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with the death of Congressman TOM LANTOS, the world lost an inspiring leader who dedicated his life to religious freedom and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it has been noted that TOM was the only Holocaust survivor to serve in Congress, and I think it's important to note that with the sun setting on this generation of Americans, he will very likely remain the only Holocaust survivor to have served here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His leadership and guidance served as the moral conscience of America's commitment to protecting human rights. He lived the concept of "never again," and he stood against persecution all over the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, I would like to get a little bit personal myself. As a newer Member of Congress, I can tell you that since I got here, TOM LANTOS always made me feel like my grandfather was looking out for me. He always had a word of encouragement, always made me feel good about myself. If I felt a little shaky, I could turn to TOM, and he would tell me, "Honey, it's okay. Go out and just do your best. You are going to do great." He would always offer those words of encouragement.  So that was really an incredible feeling to have that kind of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young Jewish American, I can tell you that we all believed that Representative &lt;/em&gt;&lt;b&gt;LANTOS served as a role model for what we want public service to be. His dedication to lifting up oppressed people throughout the world  serves as our personal inspiration. And I know that his service was a tremendous source of pride for the Jewish community across this country and for his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, and countless others, feel a deep sense of loss in his passing, but we take solace in the knowledge that the world is a better place because of this great individual.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it was with great sadness that I learned of TOM LANTOS' passing yesterday. As our colleague and our friend, we knew him to be a man of incredible courage and strength, a man who had overcome unimaginable adversity to serve as a voice for justice against the dark forces of human evil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM was born to Jewish parents in Hungary. He was 16 when Hitler's army marched in to occupy his birth country in 1944, and he tragically lost much of his family in the Holocaust. TOM courageously escaped from forced labor camps not once, but twice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in Congress, he rose to the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee with the unique perspective and the power of real moral authority. Promoting human rights for all is a part of his lasting legacy. Those who follow TOM LANTOS in that cause have a high bar to match.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM and his beloved wife, Annette, were blessed with a wonderful and extraordinarily talented family, including my dear friend, his daughter, Dr. Katrina Swett, TOM's son-in-law, Ambassador Dick Swett, our former colleague who held the seat I now hold. They and their family are my neighbors in my home State of New Hampshire. TOM was a frequent visitor to the Granite State, a remarkably devoted father, mentor, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was a patriarch in the best  sense of the word, and on behalf of all of New Hampshire's citizens, we mourn TOM's passing as one of our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have served with such a remarkable and accomplished individual. He was the first Member of Congress to welcome me when I arrived. He was an inspiration to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this time. I know they will take solace in the lasting legacy that their beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather left us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He showed us that even in the darkest corners of the human experience, one strong, clear voice, one irrepressible beacon of light can stand as an unwavering candle whose flame will never go out.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, so many of us have risen and expressed how heavy our heart is tonight. Those of us who served on the Foreign Affairs Committee with the late Chairman TOM LANTOS see every day, as we come into that room, his regalness, his royalty, but yet his humbleness. We also get to see the family, his wonderful staff, and his lovely and solid friend, bride, wife, and enormously important person, his wife, Annette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I got to see them working together. I saw TOM's passion in the committee room. He was not afraid of hard issues, and I am so proud to have been able to have joined him as a member of his Human Rights Caucus and to serve in his absence on a number of occasions when we talked about the abuse of children around the world or the abuse and the violence against women around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM was a fighter. We know that as the only Holocaust victim and survivor to have come to this place. He talked unwavering about human rights and the standing up against despots, and he never feared in doing so. The Human Rights Caucus became part of him. When you saw TOM walking, you knew he exuded a fight for human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also was concerned that we continue to fight in this Congress against oppressive regimes. So even though there are advocates for China and Russia, Burma, and certainly there is constant opposition from the Sudanese Government, he never wavered on Darfur. You heard someone say he was even arrested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I've been proud to stand with him on these fights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He led the fight to end wartime sex slavery by the military; another resolution recognizing the massacre of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire as genocide; and, yes, he held hearings condemning Internet giant Yahoo's complicity with Chinese oppression of dissidents. And I tell you, he didn't worry about whether that was a constituent; he only worried about human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Tom, for letting us know your family. I met his daughter, Katrina, and Dick in New Hampshire. What a wonderful spirit they had. I am certainly saddened by his loss, but the fighter he was should live in us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM, rest in peace. May God bless you. We fight on with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="975">H. Res. 975</bill>, "expressing the condolences of the House of Representatives on the death of the Honorable Tom Lantos," and to express my profound sadness upon the passing of my extremely distinguished colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I mourn the passing of my colleague Congressman TOM LANTOS. Chairman LANTOS was an extraordinary leader, a man who demonstrated, by his life, that one individual truly can make a difference. As the only Holocaust survivor ever to serve in Congress, Congressman LANTOS brought a moral voice to Washington, and he relentlessly drew U.S. attention to those suffering throughout the world. It has been my extreme honor and privilege to  serve on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, under Chairman LANTOS' leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since he was elected to Congress in 1981, Congressman LANTOS has used his position in Congress to combat violations of fundamental human rights. Almost immediately following his election, Congressman Lantos established the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, which, for over two decades, has focused congressional attention on struggles against oppressive regimes and human suffering across the globe, including in China, Russia, Burma, and Darfur. I have been proud to stand beside  him, as a member of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and I know my colleagues share my commitment to ensuring that his work here in Washington continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fierce advocate of human rights, he continually pressed the Bush administration to take steps to prevent the state-sanctioned massacre and rape of hundreds of thousands of people in Sudan's Darfur region. On April 28, 2006, I was honored to stand side by side with Congressman LANTOS and protest the role of the Sudanese Government in carrying out genocide in the Darfur conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Congressman LANTOS did not shy away from controversial issues. Under his leadership, the committee passed a resolution calling on the Japanese Government to end wartime sex slavery by its military, and another resolution recognizing the massacre of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire as genocide. He has brought landmark anti-trafficking legislation before the committee, held hearings condemning internet giant Yahoo!'s complicity with the Chinese  suppression of dissidents, and, tomorrow, the committee is scheduled to consider a groundbreaking reauthorization of the PEPFAR global AIDS relief program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman LANTOS was a truly courageous man, and a true leader for our Nation. His legacy is best expressed in his own words, "It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust . . . could have received an education, raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a Member of Congress. I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my condolences to the family of Congressman LANTOS: his wife Annette; his two daughters, Annette and Katrina, and 18 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. I also join with other Members of Congress in mourning the passing of an extraordinary person, leader and colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, and in recognizing our distinguished colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rep. Tom Lantos (D-CA) Dies</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rep. Tom Lantos (D-CA), an important voice for Tibetan freedom, died today at the age of 80. He had served 14 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, he twice escaped from a forced labor camp in Szob during the Nazi occupation of his country. The second time, he was sheltered by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg. After the Soviet army liberated Hungary, he discovered that his parents and  most of his family had been killed during the occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only Holocaust survivor ever to serve in Congress, Rep. Lantos was chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was also co-chairman and founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, a group dedicated to raising awareness about human rights violations around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rep. Lantos was a tireless supporter of the Tibetan independence movement and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. His contributions are too numerous to count, so I'll point you to one of the most recent: his speech in San Francisco for the 2007 Tibetan Uprising Day. He also joined Richard Gere and Robert A.F. Thurman in talking about his friendship with and admiration for His Holiness as part of A&amp;E Biography's 1997 documentary Dalai Lama: Soul of Tibet. In addition, Rep. Lantos was the driving force  behind the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal to His Holiness last year. When the House of Representatives ultimately voted to give His Holiness the honor, he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In his quiet but persistent way, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has devoted his life to asserting the Tibetan people's rights, lifting their spirits and upholding their dignity. By his humble personal example, through his prolific writings and in his addresses to audiences in every corner of the earth, the Dalai Lama has provided exceptional service to humankind. Such a vast contribution to the betterment of our world deserves special recognition and support. After nearly three decades of friendship  with His Holiness, I am deeply honored and proud to have rallied my colleagues to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. We can now look forward to the day when he once again meets with members of Congress--this time to stand before us all to receive this unique and well-earned honor."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Back, I think it was last January, there was an article in The Hill, and it described my apartment. And my apartment was described as spartan, and that's probably effusive. And we had a Judiciary Committee meeting with Justice Pryor and Justice Alito, I think there were just six or seven or eight of us there, and I choose to go to that meeting rather than the Yom HaShoah program at Statuary Hall. And I felt bad about that because I had attended all those programs in Tennessee and felt strong  about the Holocaust. And I rushed up here at the end and I saw Mr. Lantos and I went up and I said, Mr. Lantos, I'm sorry, I missed the meeting. He said, First of all, it is Tom. And I said, Well, okay, Tom.

    <paragraph>It is, indeed, an honor and a privilege to have known Tom and Annette Lantos, a remarkable American success story, a remarkable American love story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met Mr. Lantos as a new Member after the 2004 elections and was awed by him. His life story and internationally renowned fierce voice for human rights everywhere will continue to lead and inspire us for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am truly indebted to Tom Lantos for his gentlemanly demeanor and generous time and advice for me as a new Member of this House and on his Foreign Affairs Committee.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from California, our chairman-to-be of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and also my good friend and distinguished ranking member of our committee, the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I, too, would like to express my most profound sorrow and to extend my sympathies to Chairman Lantos' dear wife, Annette, and their two daughters and 18 grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my privilege to participate in this Special Order and pay special tribute to our colleague and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentleman from California, Congressman Tom Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without equal, Madam Speaker, Chairman Lantos was a champion and advocate throughout the world for the basic rights and dignity and decency of all human beings, regardless of race, color, gender, or religious affiliations. Tom Lantos truly believed that in this troubled world of ours there is only one race, and that is the human race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am without words in how I can best describe the life of this giant among men. And in this Chamber of Congress, there is no word or phrase more dear to Tom's heart than that of "human rights." And forever I will remember him as a teacher and a mentor whenever the subject of human rights is being debated or under discussion in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As others have said earlier, Chairman Lantos would not have had it any other way other than for us to continue the fight and to advocate for human rights whenever necessary, and for that matter, also to defend freedom and democracy throughout the world. We have a saying in the islands, Madam Speaker, to my friend Tom Lantos, "Ia manuia lau faiga malaga"; may you have a great voyage in the afterlife, my friend, Chairman Tom Lantos.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great deal has been said about Tom Lantos this evening, wonderful, eloquent words that captured just the profound effect that he had on this institution. Many serve in this institution. Some leave a mark on their districts of their presence here; some leave a lasting mark on the institution. It's hard for me to think of anyone who left such a mark around the world as Chairman Lantos did in so many different areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You read that statement that David Dreier read earlier, and I'm going to read it again because it captures his love of this country. He and Annette, they were the greatest Americans because they knew what the alternative had been, and they paid back with their work and with their gratitude what America offered them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is Tom Lantos' words after he is diagnosed with a very advanced stage of esophageal cancer, "It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family, and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a Member of Congress. I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He not only loved America; he hated tyranny and oppression. And I served with Tom on the committee for 26 of his 28 years in the Congress, and that anger and hostility and willingness to fight against dictatorship and tyranny covered the dictatorships of the communist regimes, and it covered the dictatorships and the oppression of the rightwing authoritarian regimes. He wasn't one side or the other; he was against tyranny for human rights. Stood firm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's very easy for us to attack forces that have no direct impacts on our district; it doesn't take that much courage to do that. Tom Lantos, notwithstanding what some company in his  district might be making in terms of sales to a particularly oppressive country, stood firm and constantly dealt with the pressures coming back from his own constituents about our livelihood, our jobs, because he couldn't tolerate the notion that, in effect, American  companies, American individual interests, American corporate interests were giving governments around the world the tools of that repression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I just want to tell one story. It was a profound experience for me, I'll never forget. I had the opportunity to see Tom a few weeks ago at his home here in Washington with Annette, with Katrina, with their granddaughter and with a baby grandson, which, by the way, was one part of what gave him his strength was this unbelievable family structure. And he looked much better than he had looked in his last few weeks here, and he talked about being at peace. Yes, he would have  loved to have been able to be here a few years longer, but for him, he felt what a wonderful life he had had, what a wonderful family, what a country, the colleagues. He was at peace with what awaited him. And there was a serenity and a strength there that just was stunning to me. I'll never forget it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the family, to Annette, our prayers are with you. And you know that the work he did, the lives he affected around the world, his presence will be maintained long after his passing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will miss him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was always very gracious during my conversations and dealings with him. I would listen closely when he spoke because what he had to say was always important.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday, the United States Congress lost a dear friend, a true humanitarian, and a real statesman, Chairman Tom Lantos of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest sympathies to Tom's dedicated wife Annette, his daughters Annette and Katrina, and to his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We are thinking of them during this difficult time and hope they will find solace in knowing that their husband, father, and grandfather was a true hero and role model for so many of the people he touched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Lantos was unrelenting in his lifelong commitment to defending the oppressed. He decisively chose to serve his fellow human beings, often at great personal risk to himself. After escaping from Nazi labor camps in World War II, young Tom fought in the underground Nazi resistance and continued to fight for justice. His ability to triumph through tragedy is truly inspirational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom embodied the American dream. In the summer of 1947, Tom was awarded a scholarship to study in the United States. He arrived in New York City with no money and only a Hungarian salami which was quickly seized by U.S. customs officials. With his incredible persistence and deep intellect, he soon earned his Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Tom was always thankful for the opportunities given to him by the United States and America is blessed  to have had such a loyal citizen and distinguished leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing his dedication to others, Tom served the American public and people of the world as an exemplary Member of Congress. He founded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and most recently served as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Standing by his convictions, Tom was arrested at the Embassy of Sudan for protesting human rights violations in Darfur. As a result of this brave action, the President renewed his call for a stronger international presence in  Darfur. Tom continually defended those too often ignored by the international community. People of the world are indebted to him for his strong leadership in promoting human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have served in Congress with Congressman LANTOS and to have worked together on significant legislation defending the international human rights of women. His support was paramount to the achievement of many gains for women's human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, we were able to provide direct assistance to advance the status of women in Afghanistan. We also collaborated on landmark legislation to stop human trafficking. I am deeply grateful for his commitment to the women of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Tom Lantos will always be remembered with respect and gratitude. He consistently gave voice to the voiceless and was their champion. His legacy of upholding human dignity will continue to inspire future generations of Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I mourn the passing, and commemorate the courageous life, of my dear friend and colleague, Congressman Tom Lantos of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Lantos began a lifetime of passionate work for human rights as a young man when he escaped a forced labor brigade to join an underground resistance movement against the Nazis in his home country of Hungary. A Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, he was just a teenager when he undertook this important work, which began over 60 years of efforts to fight for human rights across the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Lantos' life of work on behalf of human rights culminated with over two decades of service in Congress, where he never failed to champion causes that he felt were just. In 1983, Congressman Lantos became a founding co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, a caucus on which he served for the remainder of his life. Under Congressman Lantos' leadership, this caucus was on the forefront of efforts to protect women's and children's rights, to free political  prisoners, to preserve religious freedom and to halt ethnic cleansing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, Congressman Lantos directed his focus to ending the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan, which has already claimed the lives of over 400,000 people. In 2006, he was among a group of 11 individuals who were arrested for committing civil disobedience outside the Sudanese Embassy in protest of the genocide. I can only say that it was an honor to follow in this wonderful man's footsteps by doing the same thing myself a few short weeks later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning last year, when Congressman Lantos became Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he brought the crisis in Darfur and the recent violent crackdown on democracy activists in Burma to the forefront. It also must be noted that, under Chairman Lantos' leadership, the Foreign Affairs Committee finally began long-overdue oversight of the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Lantos' inspiring leadership will be sorely missed, not only in this Congress, but by people around the world. I wish to send my deepest condolences to Congressman Lantos' friends, family and constituents for the loss of this irreplaceable man of good will.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I come to say good-bye to a beloved colleague and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sudden news of Chairman Tom Lantos' passing has left those who had the privilege to know him without adequate words to express our grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers go out to his caring wife Annette and to his family. I wish them strength and clarity during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom's life and accomplishments reached far beyond his contributions as a legislator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many words have been written about Tom's experiences as a youth in Nazi occupied Europe. But none of us will ever be able to speak here with the same level of experience and understanding that he had when referring to genocide, suffering, the suppression of human rights, and the denial of human dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom carried a personal sense of responsibility to fight for those who cannot always speak for themselves: the underprivileged, the subjugated, the oppressed. It was evident in his words and actions, in every piece of legislation he crafted, and in every hand he warmly shook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His convictions were never more evident than in his work to establish the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. He founded the Caucus to focus attention on human rights abuses around the world. Not only did he work to raise awareness and increase the scrutiny of abusive practices around the globe, he worked to stop heinous acts against our fellow women and men and to bring peaceful solutions to the conflicts that led to such atrocities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His unwavering optimism and prudent leadership will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My words cannot satisfactorily articulate the loss that his death brings to me, the House of Representatives, and to the Nation he loved and served.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>When I asked TOM LANTOS for his support in defending a group of women who the Japanese Army forced into prostitution during World War II, I knew that if anyone would understand the pain of war, it would be him. For Congressman LANTOS, human rights violations were not just an abstraction. He saw his family decimated by the Nazis during the same war. He himself had suffered through the horrors of a labor camp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After surviving the honors of the Holocaust, Congressman LANTOS dedicated his life to advocating for the rights of others. He spoke for those who had no voice through his tireless advocacy as the founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A fellow member of the Bay Area delegation, Congressman LANTOS has been a mentor to me. His thirst for justice and advocacy of progressive ideals will live on in all those he inspired during his fruitful life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman LANTOS will be missed by everyone who had the privilege of working with him. I send my deepest condolences to his family, and echo his wife Annette's comments that her husband's life was "defined by courage, optimism, and unwavering dedication to his principles and his family."

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, the gentleman from California, TOM LANTOS. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has lost a true leader, and the world has lost its foremost champion of human rights. While involved in many different issues throughout his illustrious career, it is TOM LANTOS' work on behalf of suffering people throughout the world that best exemplifies the type of man he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on February 1, 1928 in Budapest to Jewish parents, TOM LANTOS faced unspeakable horror early in his life. He escaped a Nazi forced labor camp twice, the second time thankfully finding himself under the protection of Raoul Wallenberg, likely saving his life. He later learned that his parents and much of his family perished at the hands of the Nazis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the only survivor of the Holocaust serving in the House, he understood, in a way no one else could, the type of suffering man can inflict upon others. He was the founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and truly was a leader in standing up for the smallest and weakest in our global community. No injustice escaped his attention, no matter what corner of the world was involved, and he would fight doggedly to right any wrongs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He earned an academic scholarship that brought him to the United States, where he earned his bachelor's, master's and eventually doctorate degrees and entered the world of academia, before he decided to enter the political arena, serving 14 terms here in the House. He rose through the ranks to become the distinguished chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a position that allowed him to continue his battle for the common man who might otherwise not have a voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to travel with him and his wife Annette on a trip to South Korea, Cambodia, and Vietnam in January, 2001, hosted by then-Minority Leader Gephardt. I am proud to call him not only my colleague, but also my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with all of my colleagues in extending our thoughts and prayers to TOM's bride of almost 58 years, Annette, his two daughters, his 17 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He will truly be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to speak on the passing of an esteemed colleague and a true friend, former Congressman Tom Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom's dedication, passion, and fervent commitment to human rights will be deeply missed by our Nation and, indeed, around the world. As the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress, Tom fought every day to give voice to the voiceless and make true our commitment to the words "never again." Only 16 when he was rounded up in his native Hungary by the Nazis where he saw most of his family perish, Tom was a living embodiment to the ideals of courage and human  rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First elected to Congress in 1980 after a distinguished career in academia, Tom was a tireless advocate on behalf of his constituents and a fine public servant. Representing parts of San Francisco as well as his hometown, San Mateo, Tom zealously represented the interests of his District and, speaking as a Member of the California delegation, I was proud to serve with him and call him friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Tom had a remarkable career of over a quarter of a century in Congress, it was his last year as chairman of his beloved House Foreign Affairs Committee that he seemed to relish the most. From that perch, he was able to advance the cause of human rights and to shine a light on long ignored parts of the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom is survived by his loving wife Annette, by his two daughters, Annette and Katrina; by 17 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, maybe because I, too, lost many family members in the Holocaust, I felt a special affinity for Tom Lantos. His story was an integral part of him. I was moved every time he described himself as the only Holocaust survivor in Congress. And so were many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom was eloquent, passionate, insightful, elegant--and fierce in his advocacy. His questions of witnesses before his committee could be withering. He had a point of view and was unblinking in his efforts to communicate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In personal terms, Tom was a lovely human being--devoted to Annette, his daughters and that enormous crowd of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. But he was also devoted to his colleagues, this institution, to our country, and to achieving peace in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time of such entrenched partisanship--which he deplored--we desperately need more, not fewer, Toms. Sadly, that is not likely to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I shall miss him terribly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>A quick look at Representative LANTOS' life shows us what a remarkable man he really was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Hungary, he fought in the underground struggle against the Nazis in Europe and twice escaped from labor camps as a teenager.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, as the only Holocaust survivor to ever serve in Congress, he used this experience to work against the forces of oppression, intolerance, and genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative LANTOS was also known as a dedicated family man. He and his dear wife Annette were usually inseparable--and all of my colleagues in the House knew of his dedication to his 17 grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let us take this time to recognize and mourn our dear friend Representative TOM LANTOS--a fierce defender of human rights, and true leader who worked to improve the world for both the free and oppressed alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thoughts and prayers of Barbara and I are with his family, friends, and constituents at this difficult time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As a member of the freshman class of the 110th Congress, Tom Lantos was certainly a colleague that I admired and looked toward for guidance. I am especially glad that under our new majority he was able to serve as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, a post that he held with distinction. There was an air about him, of European old-worldliness and charm, that I will never forget. It was a great honor to have served with a man of such character and integrity.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H861]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TOM is famously quoted as saying that he was an "American by choice." And how only in this country, could "a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground ..... have received an education, raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of Congress." As a naturalized U.S. citizen myself, I hope to give back to this Nation as much as TOM did in his many years of public service.</paragraph>
