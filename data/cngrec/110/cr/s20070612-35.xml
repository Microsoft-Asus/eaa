    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Jay Lapeyre and Laitram, LLC, of New Orleans for receiving the Recognition of Excellence in Innovation certificate from the Louisiana Technology Council. I would also like to take a few moments to expand on Laitram, LLC, and their continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Louisiana Technology Council recently hosted their third annual awards council and the first since Hurricane Katrina. This certificate awards local and regional leaders in new technology throughout the United States who have created a new industrial advance or service in the last 12 months, operated a new, original manufacturing process, or have received a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office for a recent technological discovery. More than 60 nominations were submitted from public  and private sectors, institutions, and individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>J. M. Lapeyre, the designer of the original shrimp-peeling machine in 1946, founded Laitram, LLC, and completely transformed the shrimping industry. Since its inception, his descendants have continued to carry on this tradition of improvement and modernization. Over the past 5 years, Laitram has patented more than 60 new inventions, including 16 in 2006, illustrating Laitram's commitment to innovation and the best quality for its customers and the State of Louisiana. Specifically, the Intralox  Series 400 Angled Roller conveyor belt has revolutionized the industry, allowing the replacement of older technology and maintaining Louisiana's package handling applications not only in food but in other industries as well. Therefore, I congratulate Jay Lapeyre and Laitram LLC on being an inspiration to business owners everywhere, and I wish them success.</paragraph>
