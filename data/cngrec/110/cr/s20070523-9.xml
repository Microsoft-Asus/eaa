    <paragraph>Mr. President, on Tuesday, I came to the Senate floor to present ideas on health care reform, particularly on the problem of fixing the internal operations of our broken health care system so that it runs better, at less cost, and with improved care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggested that three fundamental things are wrong with our health care  system: One, it doesn't adequately provide quality care or invest in prevention; two, the system doesn't have adequate information technology infrastructure; and, three, the way we pay for health care sends perverse price signals that misdirect market forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here today to speak about quality reform, about those areas in our health care system where improving the quality of care will lower the cost--let me repeat that--where improving the quality of care will lower the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot at stake, in money and in lives. Up to 100,000 Americans die every year as a result of unnecessary and avoidable medical errors. By some measures these outcomes are even getting worse. A 2003 article published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the rate of hospital-acquired infections has actually increased over 36 percent since 1999. This increase has occurred even though we have shortened the average length of stay in a hospital and decreased the number of inpatient  surgeries. In other words, infection rates rose that much even though the opportunities for exposure decreased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pennsylvania has recently chronicled hospital-acquired infection data for its 168 general acute care hospitals. The numbers are staggering: 19,154 patients acquired an infection while in the hospital in 2005, resulting in average commercial insurance payments of $45,601 higher than for patients who did not contract infections. That is big money that could be saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember the example I gave on Tuesday from Michigan's intensive care unit reform. In a 15-month span between March 2004 and June 2005, the project saved 1,578 lives. It saved 81,020 days patients would otherwise have spent in the hospital, at great expense; and it saved over $165 million just in a 15-month period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, it is not easy to pursue these quality reform initiatives. Funding is scarce, collaboration is required in an environment where people are pretty mad at each other, and the economics are perilous. When doctors and hospitals go to the trouble to figure out quality reform and implement it and pay for it, the effect on them is lowered revenues. Investing time and effort and capital in projects that reduce your revenues is not a great business model, but that is our health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, efforts to pursue quality reform--in all these indicated States and locations on the chart--are flickering to life around the country, in local initiatives such as the Puget Sound Health Alliance in Washington, the Utah Health Information Network, the Indianapolis Network for Patient Care, and our own Rhode Island Quality Institute. These groups have gathered health care industry players together to seek the holy grail of improved care at lower cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that this is happening is itself a small miracle. The health care system is acrid with soured, angry relationships. When I was attorney general of Rhode Island, negotiations took place between one of our major hospital chains and our major health insurer in my office. It was not because I was a great mediator or that there was a role for the attorney general in this, it was simply because they were so angry with each other that I needed to calm things down and keep them in the room so  the negotiations could proceed. For a bunch of reasons, through our Government policy to shortchange providers, through the perverse reward structure of our health care system, and our HMO experiment, we have encouraged combat among hospitals, doctors, and insurers, each trying to push their costs onto somebody else rather than working together for the common good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these local health care quality initiatives from this toxic climate are as marvelous as that spontaneous Christmas truce in World War I, when the soldiers began singing Silent Night across the barbed-wire wasteland, as they came out from the cold, muddy trenches to share cigarettes and schnapps with the enemy, men they had just been mustard-gassing and machine-gunning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you about the Rhode Island Quality Institute. By the time I became attorney general, I was already deep into health care, having served as insurance regulator, hospital trust administrator, fraud prosecutor, and health care reformer. I had seen firsthand the anger and the vitriol in the system. I had been successful in reforming the workers' compensation system and was optimistic about what sensible reforms could do to repair a broken administrative system. I saw common ground on  how quality could lower cost. In 2001, I began to pull doctors, nurses, insurers, regulators, pharmacists, academics, and hospital administrators together. Over many months, we developed a concept of a statewide collaboration that would focus on producing significant, measurable improvements in health care quality, safety, and value in Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Quality Institute was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then we have made significant progress in e-prescribing, electronic health records, ICU infection rates, and health information interoperability. This happened because the Quality Institute is a place where health care leaders can work through health care problems, despite economic signals that punish them for doing the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in Rhode Island, our hospitals are pursuing a quality improvement project in every intensive care unit in the State, modeled on the Michigan program. The Rhode Island ICU program had a significant hurdle to overcome, however. The cost was expected to be $400,000 per year to be borne by the hospitals. The savings, estimated to be $8 million per year, went to the payers. For its $400,000 invested, a hospital actually stood to lose money from shorter intensive care unit stays and fewer  procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For hospitals, truly pushing that quality envelope and striving for zero tolerance in infections in errors was economically self-abusive behavior. It took the Christmas truce relationships developed within the Rhode Island Quality Institute to overcome that obstacle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now similar things are happening all over the country, in little flickering beginnings of reform. The easiest and best way to promote quality reform that lowers cost is to feed, with Federal grants, a little kindling into these flickering flames; to tend them gently with Federal encouragement and support, to network them together to share energy and information and ideas, to have Federal officials clear away regulatory obstacles to their initiatives, and to report on the best and brightest ideas  and successes that emerge--in a nutshell, to create a MacArthur genius grant program to encourage these efforts and to clear the way for them through the bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation proposes a Federal grants program to do just that. A little money will go a long way. The CVS/Caremark charitable trust just guaranteed the Rhode Island Quality Institute $500,000 per year for the next 5 years, a great expression of business support and confidence, and it has made a world of difference. Compare that half-million-dollar yearly investment to the savings from the Keystone project in Michigan over a little more than a year, 15 months--$165 million. What if every Quality  Institute-type organization got a half million dollars? There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 such organizations around the country now. The total savings they can generate could be hundreds of millions, billions of dollars perhaps, based on a yearly investment of perhaps $25 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don't forget, it is not just money. The Keystone project saved over 1,500 lives. Quality reform is already on the march in local communities. To make a significant difference, we need do no more on the Federal level than support these initiatives, encourage new ones, transmit best practices and ideas, and, when necessary, secure waivers for them to help realize the promise of quality reform in both lives saved and dollars saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will close today by noting that if we can do three things together--quality reform, health IT investments, and reimbursement alignment--they will reinforce each other and compound the beneficial effects. Remember, health care is a dynamic system and cannot just be told what to do. We have to identify the problems, find their causes, and repair them. That is not a partisan or even a political effort; it is a repair job, and it has no more a Democratic or a Republican nature to it than an engine  tune-up or a plumbing repair. We should work together on  this issue to get it right. Hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake, and terrible consequences await American families and businesses as health care costs mount if we fail in our duty. While we still have the time before the economic, fiscal, and health consequences become too urgent for deliberate action, let us not fail in our duty. Let us grasp the controls of change.</paragraph>
