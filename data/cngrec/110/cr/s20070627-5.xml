    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="1639">S. 1639</bill>, the immigration legislation. As I said yesterday, cloture was filed on the bill. Any germane first-degree amendments need to be filed today by 1 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, another reminder to Members about the briefing by Admiral McConnell which will take place in S-407 and will run until 11:30 this morning. I will say to everyone, we could have votes during that period of time. I announced that last night. That is very possible, that we will have votes on this immigration bill. We are under postcloture rules. We are going to finish this legislation this week. And we very much appreciate the admiral coming down here, but, of course, he did not know what our  schedule would be. But others may be inconvenienced because there very well could be votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say a couple of things before we get to immigration. I would notify the two managers that I may have to have a short quorum call because there are some changes they are making on procedural matters. I think we need a couple of minutes to get that straightened out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sought yesterday to move to <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the ethics and lobbying reform bill. There was a reason the bill came first. From the first day, we knew that all progress would depend on renewing the peoples' faith in the integrity of this institution, the Congress. This legislation which passed here in the Senate does just that: It prohibits lobbyists and those who hire lobbyists from giving gifts to lawmakers and staff; it prevents corporations and lobbyists from paying for questionable travel for Members  and staff; it requires Senators to pay fair market value for chartered flights, putting an end to abuses of corporate travel; slows the revolving door by extending the ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress and senior staffers; prevents Senators from even negotiating for a job as a lobbyist until their successor has been elected; puts an end to the pay-to-play</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I asked consent to send our legislation to conference. The Republicans objected. I think it is interesting that on the same day this objection took place preventing us from moving forward to complete this legislation, there was yet another sign of how desperately needed this reform is. Yesterday, Stephen Griles, President Bush's former Interior Deputy Secretary, the No. 2 in charge, was sent to prison and fined for his corruption. This sentence came after Griles admitted to obstructing  the investigation of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Now Mr. Griles will face justice for his contribution to disintegrating the peoples' trust in their Government. But now we have a chance to look forward, to stop the Jack Abramoffs, the  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will come, before the day is out, and ask once again  unanimous consent to appoint conferees in this legislation. The eyes of the country are upon us as to what we are going to do with ethics reform and lobbying reform in this Congress. Are we going to be prevented from completing this legislation? The answer is up to the minority, the Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I came to the floor to express appreciation to Richard Lugar, the senior Senator from the State of Indiana, former chairman and current ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, for his comments on the tragic war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said on previous occasions that Democrats are virtually unanimous in our opposition to the war and united in our efforts to change course. But we face an obstinate President who refuses to hear the call of the American people. We face a Republican minority that has largely stood by his side as conditions in Iraq have deteriorated, and we have more than 3,500 dead Americans. I understand those who are wounded are approaching 30,000, a third of them grievously wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opposing the President of one's own party, especially on a war, is no small thing. And now Senator George Voinovich, another key Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, has stepped forward along with Senator Lugar to question what is going on in Iraq. In a letter to President Bush, Senator Voinovich urges the President to finally wake up to the truth so many of us already know: This war cannot be won militarily, can only be won politically, diplomatically, and  economically. Senator John Warner said yesterday that he expects more Republicans to join our call for a responsible change of course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this war finally ends--and we are in the fifth year of this war, and it will end--this last period of time where we have had Lugar, Voinovich, and Warner speak out about the present situation in Iraq could be the turning point. This could be the moment when we break down the aisle that separates the two parties on Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to my Republican colleagues who continue to follow President Bush's lead: Join with us. When I say "us," we now have at least five Republicans that I know of, and I would be happy to run through the names: Hagel, Smith, Voinovich, Lugar, and Warner have already spoken out. Join with us. We can extricate our troops from the firing line of another country's civil war. We can begin to rebuild our battered military so they can focus on the real threats we face around  the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember what the National Council of Mayors did yesterday. They also said, and voted by a majority, the war should end as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first step has been taken by my Republican colleagues. We need more help. Now we need to put their brave words in action by working together to bring home our brave troops and deliver the responsible end to the war that the American people demand and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
