    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th year of the Boy Scouts. On August 1, 1907, Robert Baden-Powell, along with 20 young men, opened a camp at Brownsea Island, England. Since that day, Scouting has been responsible for inspiring more than 300 million individuals from over 216 countries and territories. The role and mission behind Scouting is to create an education program that promotes common ideals such as loyalty and honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scouting has achieved success with dedicated adult volunteers who encourage young people to be constructive citizens. As the grateful father of four Eagle Scouts, encouraged by my wife, Roxanne, I have seen firsthand the positive influence of Scouting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years ago today, I participated in my second backpacking trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. I wish the Boy Scouts a happy 100th birthday and congratulate them on their 21st World Scout Jamboree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
