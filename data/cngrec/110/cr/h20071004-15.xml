  <narrative>OPEN AND TRANSPARENT SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11255]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better from their government when it comes to the way it spends their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. As Jerry Bellune of the Lexington County Chronicle would say, "It's the people's money, not the government's money given to the people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems that this Democrat majority which rode to power on a wave of promises about open and transparent Congress has decided these principles do not apply when it comes to all earmarks. So I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if identifying who is sponsoring an earmark is okay on spending bills, why is it not okay on all legislation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people deserve more transparency from their government, not multi-million dollar spending packages slipped silently into legislation under a bureaucratic cover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th. Thank goodness for Rush Limbaugh, who supports our troops.</paragraph>
