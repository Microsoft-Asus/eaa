  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="CHESHIRE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SWIM TEAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to some of Connecticut's finest high school athletes: the girls swim team of Cheshire High School. Cheshire High recently set a national record with an astounding 235 dual meet wins in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With its victory, Cheshire High breaks a record that had been held for 13 years by Elkhart Central High in Indiana--one of the longest-standing, most respected marks in high school swimming. Even more incredibly, the Connecticut streak dates back all the way to 1986, before any members of the current team were born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their record-setting night brought together parents who decorated the pool, painted their faces, and dressed up as the school's Ram mascot; more than 200 paying spectators; and the support of an entire community. For a town still struggling to overcome the memory of last July's notorious home-invasion murders, it was a joyous community celebration; I hope it will go a little way toward restoring the spirit of this Connecticut town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For their teamwork and success, I applaud the Cheshire High swimmers:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Megan Aitro, Tara Aitro, Olivia Amato, Alexandria Barry, Jessica Bauer, Kailee Brown, Bridget Carmichael, Alyssa Carofano, Tina Chang, Katherine Collins, Kayla DeLuca, Adriana DiCenzo, Nicole Dicks, Rachael Dioses, Kelly Dolyak, Danielle Forrest, Amy Hudak, Kathryn Hummel, Kimberly Jerome, Jasmine Liu, Samantha Loignon, Shirin Lowell, Sofia Martone, Alexandra Maurice, Mairin McKinlay, Jessica Metcalf, Melissa Metcalf, Michaela Morr, Jessica Morse, Megan Mostoller, Stephanie Nguyen, Catherine  Patrell, Brianna Perazella, Lauren Piccolino, Emilie Ptaszynski, Elissa Rosenfield, Sarah Schulefand, Morgan Schwenn, Meghan Shanahan, Sydney Smith, Jennifer Thompson, Margaret Tooley, Emma Velcofsky, and Elizabeth Visconti.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations are due as well their assistant coaches, William Lapman and Kristen Shanley, and their dedicated coach, Ed Aston, whom his team pulled, fully dressed, into the pool once the record was broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a true team, and town, achievement; and if I could list here the names of all 278 athletes who contributed their part to the streak, I certainly would. Instead I simply extend my admiration and my best wishes for many more wins to come.</paragraph>
