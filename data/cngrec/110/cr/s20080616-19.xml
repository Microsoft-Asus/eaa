    <paragraph>Madam President, in the early history of our Nation, many flags flew over the land that became the United States of America. The British Union Jack, the Spanish flag, the French flag, the Dutch flag, and others identified territory and colonies under the control of those nations. Then, as the colonies and various fighting forces organized themselves to take up the call of the new nation-to-be, many new flags began to fly. Some had pine trees, some had rattlesnakes, and others were  simpler designs or slogans, but all sought to establish a separate and many times defiant new identity for the new nation and its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the course of conducting the war, the Continental Congress had many important and pressing decisions to make. Among them was the choice of a flag under which the armies and colonies could unite, a fitting symbol for the new nation. Accordingly, on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted a resolution establishing a national flag for the United States. Following a still familiar pattern, a special committee had first been appointed to develop the design for the new flag, and the resolution  implemented the committee's recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution itself was quite simple, and stated only that " the flag of the United States shall be of thirteen stripes of alternate red and white, with a union of thirteen stars of white upon a blue field, representing a new constellation." The 13 stripes and stars were symbolic of the 13 colonies that had fought for and won the liberty to establish the new nation, of course, but no formal symbolism was assigned to the color choices, which were the same as those found on the British Union  Jack. Since 1777, however, many poets and speakers have embued the colors with symbolism, as did Joseph Rodman Drake, in his poem, "The American Flag":</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, the flag grew and changed as the United States grew, adding stripes as well as stars before it was recognized that the expansion of the States was greater than the flag's pattern could bear. When Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star Spangled Banner" after watching the battle of Fort McHenry during the war of 1812, the flag he wrote about had 15 stars and 15 stripes. By 1816, the United States consisted of 19 States, with more to come. So, once again, Congress established a special  committee, this one directed by New York's Peter Wendover, to study the problem of the flag's design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early in 1818, the congressional committee presented a report. The report recommended a solution proposed by Chester Reid, a naval captain and hero of the war of 1812. His suggestion was that the 13-stripe flag honored the original 13 colonies, and that new States could be honored by the simple addition of stars, to reflect the growth of the new constellation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 4, 1818, President James Monroe signed into law the Flag Act of 1818. Like the original Flag Resolution of 1777, the Flag Act of 1818 was short, consisting of two sections. The first section noted that, as of July 1819, "the flag of the United States be thirteen horizontal stripes, alternate red and white; that the union have twenty stars, white in blue field." The second section provided the process for adding stars to the flag upon the entry of each new State to the Union. This elegant  solution provided the flag that we hold so dear today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our flag, the Stars and Stripes, or "Old Glory," still serves to unite our Nation today. It is a symbol of our Nation that is instantly recognizable around the world. It is both commonplace, seen daily in front of post offices, government buildings and schools, and yet hallowed, placed with solemn care over the coffin of a veteran or flying at half mast to mark a tragedy. It can also be a symbol of patriotic pride, carried proudly by Olympic athletes as it will be in Beijing this August, or  streaming in the wind behind a mighty warship. And who can forget the sudden, spontaneous, outbreak of U.S. flags that erupted across the Nation in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy? That act captured the essence of our Nation and our flag--a nation defiant, strong, and united in the face of adversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Saturday, many Americans braved the scorching heat and the violent weather and floods that have caused so much misery in recent days, and observed Flag Day by displaying the flag at their home or their workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I close with one of my favorite poems about the flag. It is titled "Hats Off!" by Henry Holcomb Bennett.</paragraph>
