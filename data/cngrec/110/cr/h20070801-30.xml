    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I rise in strong support of SCHIP or the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, CHAMP. There are 45 million uninsured, and 6 million are children. These are children that are being impacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talk about having productive children in our school systems, improving the quality of life. You can't do it without a clean bill of health. We have the responsibility for our children. More than 70 percent of uninsured Hispanic children eligible for public coverage are not enrolled. This is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHAMP Act takes significant steps in reducing the barriers for all children and seniors of color in our community. Unfortunately, some of the Members are using this legislation as an opportunity to debate unrelated health care, specifically, immigration policies and other issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make sure that we support the CHAMP act. A vote for CHAMP will help more citizen children get access to health coverage which can be a difference between life and death.</paragraph>
