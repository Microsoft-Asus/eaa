  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Now Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Tuberculosis is one of the greatest infectious causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 1.6 million people per year--one person every 20 seconds.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) One-third of the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis bacterium and an estimated 8.8 million individuals develop active tuberculosis each year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Tuberculosis is the leading infectious killer among individuals who are HIV-positive due to their weakened immune systems, and it is estimated that one-third of people with HIV infection have tuberculosis.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Today, tuberculosis is a leading killer of women of reproductive age.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) There are 22 countries that account for 80 percent of the world's burden of tuberculosis. The People's Republic of China and India account for 36 percent of all estimated new tuberculosis cases each year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Driven by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, incidence rates of tuberculosis in Africa have more than doubled on average since 1990. The problem is so pervasive that in August 2005, African Health Ministers and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared tuberculosis to be an emergency in Africa.</narrative>
  <narrative> (7) The wide extent of drug resistance, including both multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), represents both a critical challenge to the global control of tuberculosis and a serious worldwide public health threat. XDR-TB, which is characterized as being MDR-TB with additional resistance to multiple second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, is associated with worst treatment outcomes of any form of tuberculosis. XDR-TB is converging with the  HIV epidemic, undermining gains in HIV prevention and treatment programs and requires urgent interventions. Drug resistance surveillance reports have confirmed the serious scale and spread of tuberculosis with XDR-TB strains confirmed on six continents. Demonstrating the</narrative>
  <narrative> (17) The United States Agency for International Development is the lead United  States Government agency for international tuberculosis efforts, working in close partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and with the President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief. The goal of the United States Agency for International Development is to contribute to the global reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with tuberculosis by  building country capacity to prevent and cure tuberculosis and achieve global targets of 70 percent case detection and 85 percent treatment success rates. The United States Agency for International Development provides support for tuberculosis programs in countries that have a high burden of tuberculosis, a high prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV, and a high risk of MDR-TB.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO COMBAT TUBERCULOSIS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Policy.--Subsection (b) of section 104B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b-3) is amended to read as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(b) Policy.--It is a major objective of the foreign assistance program of the United States to control tuberculosis.

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. <bill type="h" number="1567">H.R. 1567</bill>, the Stop TB Now Act, which I introduced with my colleagues, the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), has 106 bipartisan cosponsors, and I am proud it is moving forward today. It is a very, very important and timely bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International tuberculosis control has become an important issue to me. It is remarkable in this day and age, with treatment available, that TB is the biggest infectious killer of young women in the world. In fact, TB kills more women worldwide than all causes of maternal mortality. As you know, tuberculosis is also the biggest killer of people with AIDS worldwide. Someone in the world is newly infected with TB every second, and TB counts for more than one-quarter of all preventable adult deaths  in developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that the global community, with the United States in the lead, must do more to adequately address this disease by investing in quality TB control programs, using the groundbreaking Global Plan to Stop TB as a guide. It is for this reason that I have introduced this bill, the Stop TB Now Act, which will set forth the U.S. fair share towards achieving the goals of the Global Plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe if we don't make bold and wise investments in international tuberculosis control, not only will we fail to save millions of lives and miss out on the many accompanying benefits of controlling this killer, but also that this disease will become far more difficult and costly to treat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extremely drug-resistant TB, or XDR-TB for short, highlights this danger. It has been found on six continents, is a growing epidemic in southern Africa, and is already reported to be here in the U.S. Regular, or non-drug-resistant, TB is curable with drugs that cost just $16 in most developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Cases of drug-resistant TB, however, can cost thousands of dollars to cure,  with treatment that is far more difficult for patients and practitioners. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a man-made problem and is caused by poor TB treatment. We, the global community, have the power to prevent drug-resistant TB and the power to treat and control regular TB, and yet, unfortunately, we have chosen not to do so by our inaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through aggressive, committed leadership, the U.S. has proven that it is feasible to massively scale-up our investment to fight HIV/AIDS and malaria, and well we should. We have increased funding to fight AIDS from $840 million in 2001 to $2.9 billion in 2004, to over $4.4 billion in the House Foreign Operations bill in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. funding for malaria efforts increased from $100 million in 2006 to an administration request of $387 million for fiscal year 2008, with a House Foreign Operations level of $350 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even our response to the potential threat of avian flu has been aggressive, from just $4 million a few years ago to $100 million in the Foreign Operations budget for fiscal year 2008 and an additional $160 million in the fiscal year 2007 supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, only tuberculosis, the greatest curable infectious killer on the planet, has been left behind, and we must correct that, and that's the purpose of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of our chronic neglect of tuberculosis, this disease is not only responsible for the preventable deaths of some 4,000 people every day, it is undermining our enormous efforts and billions in investments to fight AIDS. Tuberculosis is the leading killer of people with AIDS. Through U.S. leadership, we are seeing increasing numbers of AIDS patients access life-saving antiretroviral therapy, but they're not dying of AIDS. They're dying instead of tuberculosis. And what a shame that is and  how ridiculous it is when we have the power to stop and end it. And more recently, people have been dying in large numbers in southern Africa due to drug-resistant TB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the President's AIDS initiative has made commendable scale-ups in TB and HIV efforts, they are still, in my opinion, grossly insufficient. Much of PEPFAR's scale-up supports testing tuberculosis patients for HIV and ensuring that TB and AIDS programs work together. It's very important. I'm glad we're doing it, but it's not addressing the core TB program needs. And PEPFAR's TB-HIV efforts are focused on those co-infected with both diseases and mostly in Africa, again, while commendable,  but TB is a global problem and we need to combat it everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The costs of inaction are greater than the costs laid out in this bill. This past spring, it became clearer than ever that tuberculosis knows no border when a gentleman named Andrew Speaker, an attorney from Atlanta, traveled across the globe and came back to the United States with a highly resistant form of TB. We all remember that. Many of us were shocked by it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being from New York, I'm very familiar with what happens when TB control is neglected. In the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the City of New York paid a dear price for its failure to invest adequately in tuberculosis control. The city, along with many other areas of the country at the time, experienced an epidemic of tuberculosis. In this case, the epidemic was a multidrug-resistant TB, which inevitably develops in the absence of basic TB control. New York City launched an aggressive tuberculosis  control campaign and brought down its burden of drug-resistant TB. The cost to the city? Over $1 billion to control some 300 cases, far higher than it would have been and it would have cost to prevent the situation in the first place. Tuberculosis is not just a global issue, but as we can see, it's certainly a local one as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to tuberculosis, Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot afford to maintain the status quo. The resources authorized in this bill represent a realistic and urgently needed increase in funding for global TB control based on the needs laid out in a costed-out, comprehensive business plan. The cost of inaction is much, much greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I would especially like to pay tribute to our former colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown, who was a champion of global tuberculosis efforts during his time in the House. He's doing this great work as well now in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the many groups whose advocacy helped bring the Stop TB Now Act to the floor, particularly RESULTS and the American Thoracic Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Lantos, Congressman Payne and their staffs for their unfailing support for tuberculosis control and this legislation and to the Energy and Commerce Committee and Mr. Dingell for expediting consideration of this bill. I'm proud to serve on both the Foreign Affairs and the Energy and Commerce Committee, the two committees that have jurisdiction on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is truly a bipartisan bill. I wish to thank the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and all the people, all the colleagues who have cooperated on both sides of the aisle because only by working together can we get at the scourge of TB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us, <bill type="h" number="1567">H.R. 1567</bill>, the Stop Tuberculosis Act of 2007, has been put forward by its supporters to provide a very significant increase in our foreign aid spending on anti-TB programs abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we rely on figures gathered with the assistance of the Congressional Research Service, the bill would raise our spending on such programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development by about six times in the next 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a brief letter received late last week from the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would increase such spending somewhat less, by somewhere between two and three times in the next 2-year period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although it is possible that the latter estimate by CBO may inadvertently have included in its baseline comparison current funding levels for some anti-TB programs outside of the scope of this bill, it is clear that this measure seeks a major increase in the AID programs it covers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along those lines, the bill strongly encourages, if not directs, the President to ensure that the funds that would be provided under this bill will be transferred to the World Health Organization's "Stop TB Partnership" plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the funding amounts in the bill have apparently been formulated using a calculation meant to reflect what the United States' fair share might be in funding that international plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the determination of the supporters of this measure to do more to combat TB overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, my mother was afflicted with tuberculosis when she was in her mid to late teens and was on her back for a year, just didn't get out of bed. So we understand the importance of eradicating TB, not only worldwide but in the United States. She's done well, though. By coincidence, this is her 86th birthday, and so she recovered fully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Congressman Engel for his work on this. I know that he's worked very, very hard, and also Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON of New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, we don't have any more speakers, and if you all don't, I will yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you have some more speakers?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no further speakers, but I would like to respond a bit to some of the points that you made.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, and I just want to let him know and let my colleagues know that we worked together with Senator Lugar, who's the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and we specified that the funding would be a ceiling, not a floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill appropriates up to $400 million in 2008 and up to $550 million in 2009, including global activities to be carried out by USAID and CDC. So that's what we did. We negotiated it so we wouldn't necessarily spend all the money. We would spend up to that amount of money, and that would be the limit, but it would not be the  money that we would spend if we didn't need to spend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked closely with WHO, CDC and USAID, and the overall global number is derived from Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan to Stop TB 2006 through 2015, of which WHO is a partner and USAID is the current Chair of the Stop TB Partnership's coordinating board. The plan is well documented, detailed, costed out, and again, builds up from country estimates and was reviewed in an exhaustive process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally and furthermore, the World Health Organization developed and released a "Global MDR-TB and XDR-TB Response Plan" that supplements the need calculated by the Global Plan's need in light of the outbreak of drug-resistant TB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USAID and the CDC work together globally and both have agreed to this coordination of funding, and again, we have a ceiling of what we spend and not a floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I thank my colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1567">H.R. 1567</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
