  <narrative>THE COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT -- (Senate - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11573">S11573</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was absent for the vote on September 7 on final passage of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 due to an official trip that I took to Iraq with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Had I been in Washington during the vote on final passage, I would have supported this important piece of legislation as I did when the Senate passed its version in July.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rising costs of a college education have significantly increased the financial burden on college students and their families in recent years. The largest increase in higher education aid since the G.I. bill, the College Cost Reduction Act will increase student aid to low-and middle-income students by $17.4 billion over the next 5 years. It also increases the maximum Pell grant by $500 to $4,810 next year and incrementally increases it until it caps at $5,400 in 2012. Further, the bill will  help students manage their debt by capping student loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly income and reducing the student loan interest rate from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. In addition, the legislation will create a pilot program that reduces the amount of federal subsidies paid to student lending institutions and redirects the funds directly to students. The result will save students real dollars, save taxpayers money, and inject competition into the loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing the number of college graduates is one of the best investments that we as a nation can make, and I am proud that this Congress has worked to make college a reality for more Americans. The improvements contained in this legislation will expand the options students have to attend college and pay for higher education for years to come. Moreover, it will improve the quality of life for our citizens and our economy by preparing our workforce for the demands of an increasingly competitive  marketplace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, too many young people, from all walks of life, are either struggling to pay for college or flatout can't afford it. Those who aren't able to incur such steep costs are not only losing out on a degree, but setting themselves up to face a lifetime of lost opportunities, as study after study shows college graduates are the most attractive candidates for the fastest growing and best paying jobs of tomorrow. Greater college access and financial assistance is critical to making  the American dream a reality for all. This bill strengthens educational resources for low-income students, giving every child the chance to succeed. It will mark the largest increase in student aid since the Montgomery GI bill and ensures that college is within the reach of children all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, families in New England with students in a community college spend 17 percent of their annual income to cover the cost of college for 1 year, while families nationally spend 13 percent. According to an analysis by the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education released last year, more than two thirds of families in Massachusetts last year still required approximately $6,300 beyond financial aid to afford a college education. Faced with such a hardship, many Massachusetts students drop out,  saying the costs are too steep. Those who do complete their degrees are often saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans--which can take years, often decades, to pay off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference report cuts roughly $20 billion from lender subsidies and  uses the funds to increase aid to college students and reduce the interest rates they must pay on their loans. It halves interest rates on subsidized student loans, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, over 4 years and increases the Pell grant by $1,090 increase in the maximum Pell grant award over 5 years. It also allows for a flexible repayment option and loan forgiveness after 10  years for certain public-sector employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also proud that the conference report included language to fund key Massachusetts Upward Bound programs. Upward Bound provides fundamental support and college preparation for low-income students and has a strong record of increasing the rate at which low-income students graduate from institutions of higher learning. Once the President signs this legislation into law, 187 new and existing Upward Bound programs that scored above a 70 in the most recent grant competition will be funded from  fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2011. As a result, Upward Bound services will be provided for an additional 12,000 students. I want to congratulate all of the new and refunded Upward Bound programs in my State--Holyoke Community College, North Shore Community College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Suffolk University and Wheelock College. Thank you for providing these necessary services to Massachusetts students and I urge you to keep up the good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is absolutely vital to securing the opportunity of higher education for all and making our country more competitive. I thank Senator Kennedy for his hard work and vision and I wholeheartedly support this legislation.</paragraph>
