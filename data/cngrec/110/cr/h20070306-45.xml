    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, public service is the cornerstone of living democracy. That said, I do fervently believe it takes a special person to give their life to serve the public. I stand before you to honor an individual who, for over 30 years, dedicated his life to public servitude, former California Lieutenant Governor, Leo T. McCarthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Governor McCarthy was one who valued what was best for all of Californians, not just those that were of means and access. Much of this can be attributed to McCarthy's humane beginnings as the child of a poor immigrant family. It was during the time McCarthy's father, Daniel, opened a pub which became the community haven for the local Irish Catholic population, that young McCarthy became smitten with service. In his youth, McCarthy engaged in many service-oriented activities, which  included early studies for the priesthood and service within the United States Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After earning his law degree, he began a career in politics that spanned over three decades. He served first as a member of the California Board of Supervisors and, in 1968, won a State assembly seat, where he eventually assumed the role of Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure in the California Assembly, McCarthy instituted a number of reforms. He reduced the number of oversight committees, provided members with bill analysis for floor sessions and provided more accountability and greater public access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo McCarthy was a man on a mission, and in 1982, he ascended to what would become the pinnacle of his political career, the role of Lieutenant Governor of the State of California. As Lieutenant Governor, McCarthy wanted to unify the differing socioeconomic and cultural climates of the State. He established the Feminization of Poverty Task Force, which was comprised of women from all walks of life to develop ways to overcome economic barriers common amongst women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also enacted legislation to better regulate nursing home patients and ensure that women had the best possible preventive care. He was an advocate for minority and female-owned businesses, and coerced business leaders into understanding the economic benefits of work site child care facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When asked to reflect about his years in the public sector, Leo McCarthy said, "I was lucky. I was in a position to make a contribution. I felt very fortunate to have played a role. Some days were miserable, and some unhappy, but there were a lot of days that were great. There was a sense of satisfaction and being helpful to people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Leo McCarthy was a dedicated public servant and long time political force in the San Francisco area for decades. It is with sad news that we speak about him on the floor today after learning about his recent death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his political career, he worked tirelessly on issues such as coastal protection, nursing home reform, breast cancer awareness, female-owned small businesses, financing for the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, employer provided child care and the prevention of hate crimes, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was born in Auckland, New Zealand and emigrated with his family to California at the age of 4. The son of an Irish bar owner, he was raised in San Francisco's Mission district and attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before his political life began, he served his country proudly in the Korean war in the U.S. Air Force. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of San Francisco and his law degree from San Francisco law school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He began his political career as the youngest member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1963 before serving on the California Assembly from 1969 to 1982. He honorably led the California Assembly as its Speaker from 1974 to 1980. He was elected to a record three terms as Lieutenant Governor before retiring from politics in 1994. While serving as Lieutenant Governor, he instituted reforms to provide more accountability and greater public access. Among his work, he established the Feminization  of Poverty Task Force comprised of women leaders from business executives to former welfare recipients to develop ways to overcome economic barriers confronting women. He also supported the Greater Avenues for Independence Program to help welfare recipients enter the work force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After retiring from politics in 1994, his passion and dedication to public service continued with the creation of the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco. The goal of the center is to inspire and equip students for lives and careers of ethical public service and serving others. Since its inception in the fall of 2001, the McCarthy Center has initiated several programs including academic courses, public panels, internship programs and  faculty-led projects that engage students in the analysis of social and political issues. Leo McCarthy's leadership in the center spread inspiration throughout all the students and staff involved. It exemplified his dedication to his community and to the greater good. He will be greatly missed by all those who knew him and worked with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all Members to join me in support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that the author of the bill, Representative ANNA ESHOO from California, be given 5 1/2  minutes to speak.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague and my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle for being here today to pay tribute to really a great and very good man, Leo McCarthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of knowing Leo for many, many, many years. He was not only my mentor; he was my friend. He was dear to my family. But he inspired me in public service. I had the privilege of serving as his chief of staff of his district office, which was in San Francisco, at the time, and I learned so much from him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many times, my colleagues, that the closer we get in terms of view of someone, the less we may like what we see. With Leo McCarthy, the closer I got, the more I saw, the more my respect for him was deepened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>He was a man of the fullest integrity. He was an honest man. An honest man. And he made everyone proud of his service to people not only in his beloved city of San Francisco but in the entire State of California. I think he helped to make California more golden of a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a policy wonk. He knew exactly why he had gone into government service. In all of his years serving on the board of supervisors in the city and county of San Francisco to his election to the assembly, the California Assembly, to his elevation as Speaker of the California Assembly, and then the time that he served as Lieutenant Governor, political writers, the people that he served, the counties throughout our State, 58 counties and the people that live in them, knew that Leo McCarthy's  word was golden, that he was there to serve them and that that is what motivated him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a great family man. All the years that he served in Sacramento, he drove home every single evening to be with his family in San Francisco. It was really the measure of the man. The love of his life was Jackie McCarthy, and he always said that she did the hard work because she was at home raising four extraordinary children: Sharon, Conna, Niall, and Adam. I wish all of my colleagues could have heard these four adults pay tribute to their father at St. Ignatius Church at the magnificent  funeral mass that was in celebration of his good life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man filled with faith, and he served at a very early time in the minor seminary. And he said to me one day, Anna, that didn't last too long. And I responded to him, Leo, it lasted a lifetime. Because he blended his faith with the service that he gave to people and he was rooted in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he left public life, he went on, and in the latter years of his all too short life, I think, I always wanted Leo to live forever, he founded a center at the University of San Francisco, his alma mater that he loved so much. And during the funeral mass, the Jesuits paid tribute to him. There must have been 30 Jesuits on the alter, the archbishop of San Francisco, the former bishop of Oakland, and the auxiliary bishop, John Westor, all there to pay tribute to Leo McCarthy. That Center for  Public Service and the Common Good spoke of Leo's desire to help students get involved in public policy at the State, at the Federal, and the local levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo McCarthy had a singular friend that loved him in unquestioned ways. He was his aid when Leo first went to Sacramento as a member of the State legislature. He then was elected in his own right to the State legislature. He then went on to become the mayor of San Francisco. And that man is Art Agnos. Every single day of Leo's too long illness, which marked all of last year, and at all other times in his life but especially during that difficult time, Art Agnos was by Leo's bedside every day,  every night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by thanking all the members of the committee for passing the resolution. It will mean a great deal to the family. I thank Josh Andrews in my office. I thank all of my colleagues. I know this will mean a great deal to the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I say to whomever is listening in, God rest Leo McCarthy's noble soul.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from the State of California (Mr. Lewis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very, very appreciative of this resolution being on the floor today. A phrase oft used in the West would suggest that you should "bring us men to match our mountains." And in California such men have made truly a magnificent difference in the way the far West was developed. Leo McCarthy certainly was at the top rank of those leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met Leo McCarthy when he and I were elected to the State legislature together. We were classmates and colleagues and friends. A supervisor and assemblyman, became Speaker of the House, Lieutenant Governor of our State, a magnificent leader who absolutely wallowed in the business of public policy. He cared about making a difference on a number of issues across the spectrum of those issues that impact people's lives. He was a guy who was devoted to his family, as has been suggested, but  also devoted to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we pay tribute to Leo McCarthy today, let us seek other men and women who would so serve, for, indeed, he is an example of the very best among us and reflects the best of our public affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that probably most important to me over the years was the fact that Leo, while he played a very significant partisan role, absolutely knew in his soul that real solutions did not come by way of partisan confrontation. A magnificent leader who I am proud to say was my very good friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request that Representative JIM COSTA of California speak for 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair, ranking members, and colleagues, especially those who, like myself, from California had an opportunity to serve with Leo McCarthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo McCarthy, as has been said, put faith, family, and service as the preeminence in his life goals, and he lived them every day by example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo McCarthy was Speaker when I was first elected to the State Assembly in 1978. Those were heady days in California, and Speaker McCarthy had a contentious caucus that he had to work with among younger members who thought that they oftentimes knew better. But I can tell you that from the lessons I learned firsthand from Speaker McCarthy, later to be our Lieutenant Governor, was that of being a quintessential legislator. He believed in process, he believed in transparency, he believed in accountability,  and he believed in working in bipartisan fashions to solve problems for people of California. And because of those facts, Leo McCarthy's speakership was successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was part of a group that ended up in what often happens within political families, a difficult speakership fight, and I chose for various reasons not to support Speaker McCarthy. Nonetheless, we travailed for over a year. During that entire time, Leo maintained class and maintained dignity and attempted to still reach out and bring the caucus back together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was not to be, but his legacy was the fact that he always, always treated people the way he wanted to be treated himself. And for that I would like to join with my colleagues in the memory of a tremendous public servant, not only in California but throughout our country, Leo T. McCarthy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from the State of California (Mr. Dreier).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank my very distinguished colleague ANNA ESHOO for authoring this, and I want to congratulate my California colleagues on both sides of the aisle for once again coming together to recognize public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I never had the opportunity to serve in Sacramento, but I did know Leo McCarthy to be an extraordinary public servant. And one of the things that is very moving, as I listened to the remarks of my colleague from Highland, Mr. Lewis, who was elected with Governor McCarthy in 1968 to the California State legislature and as I listened to ANNA ESHOO, who I had no idea she was his district office representative, I was reminded of the fact that public service is a very  important calling. And as I listened to Ms.  Foxx outline the service record, although I suspect she never met Leo McCarthy, she went through his extraordinary accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a legislator, I am reminded of the fact that we need to recognize that we are here to do the people's business. Yes, we need to have that clash of ideas. Yes, it is important that we engage in vigorous debate. But at the end of the day, we are here to accomplish very important things for the people whom we are honored to represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in 1963, as has been pointed out, that he first ran for the County Board of Supervisors, and I will say I learned not only that ANNA ESHOO was his district representative, I had heard that he was from New Zealand originally, but then when I heard he was from Auckland, I was of course reminded of the old story about the guy who got on an airplane to go to Oakland, California, and ended up in Auckland, New Zealand. And it sounded like Leo McCarthy actually took the reverse route,  and I wondered how many times he was headed to Oakland that people might have thought that he was going home to Auckland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact is I had great regard for Leo McCarthy, and I wondered why anyone would leave New Zealand, because it is a spectacular spot. In fact, I have said on more than a few occasions if I didn't have the opportunity to live in the United States of America, New Zealand would be the spot that I would live in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having said that, I will simply say that my colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, had great regard for Leo McCarthy and his extraordinary public service to the people of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God rest his soul, and our thoughts and prayers are with his wonderful family members. And I know that one of the things Leo McCarthy said when asked the question what his greatest accomplishments would be, he said it was his family, and so our thoughts and prayers are with them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 2 1/2  minutes for Representative Howard L. Berman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Ms. Watson for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to Sacramento as a State assemblyman, elected in 1972, began my service in 1973, and had never known Leo McCarthy or met him before that time. Already in the California Assembly, a speakership fight was brewing between Leo McCarthy and sort of the favored candidate over the vacancy which would occur when the Speaker at that time was planning to run for Governor and would be giving up his seat. In the course of the year and a half between the time I came to Sacramento and the time that  I voted for Speaker, I got to know someone who was particularly unique in terms of public office and public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say three words characterize the service of Leo McCarthy in all aspects of his public career and, I think, of his personal life: probity, energy, and a tremendous level of integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a very unusual public servant. He cared deeply about the public interest, about policy, about learning what needed to be known to be effective and advocating for policies, about building legislative consensus, and about making things happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 5 years that he was Speaker in the State Assembly, I had the honor of being for 4 1/2  of those 5 1/2  years his majority floor leader. The end of our legislative careers wasn't quite as good as the start of it because we ended up in a speakership fight that got rather out of control and 11 months of battle. I think of speakership fights in California as war by other means, and that is what we had during that time. And, unfortunately, after that time while our relationship was civil  and friendly, it was never as close as it was before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I have never met anybody who made his fundamental decisions on what legislation to prioritize, what to push based on a focus on the public interest without regard to what a particular lobbyist or a particular specialist might push, with a level of integrity and with a level of energy, it has already been referenced in terms of his career, that was really unique in public office. He really was a very fine man, a very youthful man. In fact, his passing is so tragic because of that youth and vigor  that he always exhibited.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of <bill type="hr" number="180">H. Res. 180</bill>, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I request that the Speaker take as much time as she desires, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. To both of them, thank you for bringing this resolution honoring Leo McCarthy to the floor. He was a very special person to us, and I thank you. Congresswoman Eshoo, thank you for your leadership in bringing this as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join my California colleagues, and others, in singing the praises of one great man, Leo McCarthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the Book of Ecclesiastes, there is a chapter known as the Eulogy of Heroes; its words could be used to describe Leo McCarthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Now let us praise great men, the heroes of our nation's history, through whom the Lord has established His renown and revealed His majesty. Some were sage counselors who led the people by their counsel and by their knowledge of the law; out of their fund of wisdom, they gave instruction. They were men of loyalty, whose good deeds have not been forgotten."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that all who knew Leo McCarthy knows how fitting that description is of him. Leo McCarthy was indeed such a person. And as the Eulogy of Heroes proclaims, "He will be buried in peace, but his name lives forever, as people recount his wisdom."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo's great wisdom was in knowing that the future of his children, Sharon, Conna, Adam and Niall, was linked to the destiny of all children. There were many years when, as the most senior Democrat in California politics, Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy was the main person standing between drastic cuts to benefits for our children, the elderly and the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo took seriously the responsibility to carry the banner of the Democratic Party, as he advanced social and economic justice. As Speaker of the State Assembly House and Lieutenant Governor, Leo promoted a values-based agenda to educate our children, grow our economy and protect our environment. He did so living up to the highest ethical standards, and he always strove to act in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo's word was his bond. And when he promised that he would protect our seniors and stand up for California's magnificent coastline, he kept his word. In fact, Leo was so scrupulously principled and honest that there are those of us who thought he must be wearing a Boy Scout uniform under his business suit. What was under there was a heart of gold. And really, in all of the testimonials that followed Leo's passing, I said he had the heart of a lion; they said he was a lion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo opened public service to so many Californians, opening up the Democratic Party and welcoming in the grassroots. As a former staffer of his said, Leo liked to take chances on talent. From him they got not only their start but also their ethics, how to look after their family, their community and their country at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also encouraged the next generation of leadership through his work at the University of San Francisco as head of the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good. Leo helped to give me my start, encouraging me not only to support candidates but to run in my own right. I consider him both a dear friend and a purposeful mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made my first run for Congress a family affair, with my children working alongside his children to elect me to Congress. I said, again, he had a heart of gold, he also had the heart of a lion which sustained him through his illness. With all the strength that he could muster and a clear mind, he gave me sage counsel and wise instruction, as the eulogy said, through this last campaign, always reminding me that it was necessary to win in order to keep faith with the American people. And I know  he took special joy in our victories in November, indeed, they were his victories as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo was optimistic to the end. And as recently as Saturday night, which was the Saturday night before he passed, I spoke to him and he said, My morale is high. I am home with Jackie, that is his wife, and my children and my  grandchildren are with me. More than anything, Leo loved his family, his wife Jackie, his children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My husband Paul and I and my entire family extend our deep sympathy to Jackie, Sharon, Conna, Adam and Niall. Again, I hope it is a comfort to them that so many people mourn their loss, sing Leo's praises and are praying for them at this sad time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Leo McCarthy will be buried in peace, but his name lives forever as people recount his wisdom.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 2 minutes for the gentleman from California, SAM FARR.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am one of the Members that served with Leo McCarthy. I was a member of the California legislature. And like Speaker Pelosi, he was the one who convinced me, when I was a young staff member working for the California legislature in 1975, that I ought to return to my district and start running in public life for politics. And that is what got me into being a county supervisor, and the rest is history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But serving with Leo McCarthy indeed is distinction for all the reasons talked about. But I loved his youthful energy. The shock of Leo McCarthy dying is that he never looked old, never seemed old. He always had the energy of youth; looked young; and just was a remarkable person. He twice ran for the United States Senate. And doing that in California is indeed a tough problem because the State is so big, so expansive, and it requires so much time, and Leo would never abandon his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember, Leo was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and I remember going on a trip to Auckland, New Zealand with him. He was welcomed home as a town hero. He pointed out that because he was born in that town, he could never run for President of the United States, not being a native born. I also traveled with him to Canada, when we went on several of the communications issues. And I remember him so devoted to Jackie that he took all his life savings to make sure that Jackie could have a wonderful  coat that she wanted, and I know that she still has that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, Leo McCarthy was the kind of person you want in public life. And indeed, California is better off for having him serve. It is a great State, and he made it greater. He produced a lot of us that are serving in Congress. And certainly, almost like a daughter, Anna Eshoo, the author of this resolution, and Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, he has a lot to be proud of. We are very proud that we were able to work for him, serve for him and be in public life  with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All our condolences go to Jackie and the family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Eshoo for offering this important legislation that I am proud to have cosponsored, honoring the life and achievements of Leo McCarthy and expressing the sorrow of the House of Representatives on his death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution properly recounts and reflects Leo's many accomplishments, a lifetime dedicated to effective service on behalf of the people of California and of the United States. Yet Leo McCarthy's life was much more than the titles he earned and the awards he accumulated. He was a loving husband to Jacqueline, his wife of 51 years, and a father of four children and 11 grandchildren. When Leo McCarthy died on February 5, he also left a world of friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that my colleagues have obtained the opportunity to speak of Leo's many outstanding personal accomplishments and his qualities, his loyalty, his friendliness, his wise counsel. Those of us who knew Leo knew these qualities well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Speaker of the California Assembly for 6 years, and then during his unprecedented three terms as Lieutenant Governor, Leo was responsible for path-breaking legislation such as the California Coastal Act and the Nursing Home Patients Protection Act. He led the way toward implementation of important initiatives to educate business on the value of employer-provided health care and programs to help welfare recipients move into the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo was a charitable man who encouraged public service through his contributions and his service at the University of San Francisco and as head of the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join in expressing the profound sorrow of this House and in offering my personal condolences to the McCarthy family on Leo's death. Our prayers are with all of you who mourn Leo McCarthy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Leo McCarthy, former Lieutenant Governor of California, who passed away last month after a long illness due to a kidney ailment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in New Zealand, Leo began his lifetime of public service for his adopted country as a member the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command in the Korean War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His political service began in 1963 when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and later to the California Assembly, where he had the honor and distinction of serving as speaker from 1974 to 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982 he was elected Lieutenant Governor--a position he held until 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo's dedication to his community was clear from the diversity of issues on which he worked: from assisting welfare recipients, to increasing breast cancer awareness, to finding ways to stop toxic contamination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also worked to promote tolerance by establishing the Lieutenant Governor's Commission on the Prevention of Hate Violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving the political field, Leo continued to serve the community by founding the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Center, where young men and women can learn and be inspired to pursue a life and career of ethical public service, is a fitting legacy for a man whose life was devoted to serving the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo McCarthy is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, their four children and eleven grandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend and colleague from California, Representative ESHOO, for sponsoring this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo McCarthy was many things in his life. He was an airman, a politician, and a life-long public servant. But above all things, he was a decent and compassionate man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo was first elected to the California Assembly in 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served with honor and distinction as its Speaker from 1974 and 1980 and went on to serve as Lieutenant Governor of California for three terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leo's accomplishments in office express the compassion and love he possessed for his fellow man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His leadership helped change the way California looked at issues like child care, breast cancer research, elder care, and treatment for the mentally ill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his professional work, he was a loving family man, and dedicated friend and mentor to countless of my California peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to honor the life of this good man. May he rest in peace.</paragraph>
