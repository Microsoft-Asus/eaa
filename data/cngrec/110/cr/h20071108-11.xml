    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is day 39. That is 39 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits in health care. That is $18.5 million a day not able to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The work on this bill has been done for months. But instead of sending this bill to the President, the Democratic leadership decided to use our veterans as a smoke screen in an effort to pass billions in unrelated domestic spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They failed in their scheme when the Senate yesterday split the bills to consider these funding issues separately and on their own merits. But today, with Veterans Day quickly approaching, the Democratic leadership is going to put our veterans aside to consider billions in bloated domestic spending instead of bringing a clean veterans bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't stand for it. The American people won't stand for it. I'm standing with our veterans. Send a clean Veterans appropriations bill to the President now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
