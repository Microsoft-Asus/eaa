  <narrative>FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS -- (Senate - September 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11406">S11406</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the 2 months since Hamas took control of Gaza, 40 tons of explosives have been smuggled from Egypt into Gaza. It is estimated that 80 tons have been smuggled in the last 2 years. Rafah, in southern Gaza, has long been a key conduit for smuggling assault rifles, pistols, ammunition, explosive materials, grenade launchers and other munitions. While smuggling has long been  a problem along this stretch of the border, the Israeli  military has reported a surge in smuggling of anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank rockets and bomb components when Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has also been a clear loss of progress made with regard to democracy and the rule of law in Egypt. Prominent members of parliament like Ayman Nour who have criticized the regime have been jailed. Nour was the leading opponent in Egypt's 2005 presidential race and was arrested on dubious charges shortly after that election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Human Rights Watch, "Security forces and police routinely torture and mistreat detainees, particularly during interrogations. Torture in the past was used primarily against political dissidents, but in recent years it has been rife in police stations as well, affecting ordinary citizens." Cellphone videos posted on the Internet have shown the police sodomizing a bus driver with a broomstick and hanging a woman by her knees and wrists from a pole for questioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has provided substantial help to Egypt over the years. For its part, Egypt should do more to control its border with Gaza and improve its record on democracy and the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To that end, section 699 of <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, as passed by the House of Representatives, requires the Secretary of State to certify that the Government of Egypt has taken "concrete and measurable" steps to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza, improve the independence of the judiciary, and improve criminal procedures and due process rights. It conditions $200 million of $1.3 billion of fiscal year 2008 foreign military financing assistance on demonstration of that clear and measurable progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We note that between the date the House passed <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill> and final action by the Congress on this legislation, more than 3 months will have passed. Even more time will pass if it becomes necessary for the Senate to take up an omnibus appropriations act this fall. Consequently, there is plenty of time for Egypt to show progress in stopping arms flows to Hamas in Gaza and to reverse recent backsliding in democratic reforms before the U.S. Congress finalizes this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I offer with Senators Lieberman, Collins and Ensign, and which I am pleased has been accepted unanimously, puts the Senate on the record stating unambiguously that Egypt must take clear and measurable steps to demonstrate progress on both reducing the flow of arms into Gaza as well as to undoing damage done to the rule of law and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congress moves toward enactment of this appropriations bill, it is imperative that support to Egypt be based on an evaluation of the performance of the Egyptian government since the initial House action. Congress must consider these results in determining what approach Congress should take regarding Egypt's foreign military financing aid during fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
