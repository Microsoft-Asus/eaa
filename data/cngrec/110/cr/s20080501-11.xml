    <paragraph>Madam President, we are facing a real problem as Americans increasingly go to the gas pump to fill the need of energy for their vehicles and they find that the prices at the pump are ever higher, more onerous, and it makes the family budget more difficult to manage. This is a problem for working families, to the typical American family trying to drive children to school, participate in carpools and other activities. It hits everyone at a time when other economic problems are surrounding  the American family. We have a problem, and we have to act. Failure to act is not an option. At this point in time, we cannot offer immediate solutions, but we have to recognize where we are. We have to recognize what has not happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall many days sitting where the Presiding Officer sits today, when our party was in the majority. Democrats would come to the floor and talk about how, if they were in power, because they were not in cahoots with the big oil companies, then things would be better, they would find a way to make things better. There was a bold announcement made by then-House minority leader Nancy Pelosi on April 24, 2006:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is when prices were tipping at $3 a gallon. They were $2-something a gallon. I wish today we were back to those moments in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices? I ask, where is the plan? What happened to that plan? Democrats came into power to lead both Houses of Congress on January 4, 2007. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota proudly took her oath; many others came into office. At that point in time, the price of gas was $2.33 a gallon. Today, it is $3.62 a gallon. Is this what the commonsense plan to bring down prices was supposed to bring us? Is this why someone had a plan that was  going to help America? Has it helped us? Have we gone up or down? The fact is, today prices are $3.62.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we should do is have some plain talk. The fact is, it didn't matter who was in control of Congress because the laws of economics go well above the laws of politics. This is about supply and demand. The fact is, there is not a commonsense plan. The fact is, there is no plan, that America's energy policy continues to flounder for several reasons. We have to act, and we have to act as responsible leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that is inevitable is that as long as supply and demand stay where they are today, with demand ever increasing and supply topping out, we will continue to have increasing prices. I submit that part of what has to occur is increased production. We have to find ways that we can, within our own borders, produce more energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been supportive of drilling in 2000 acres of the vast wilderness of Alaska in a way that would be safe. If it had been done back when President  Clinton vetoed it, today a million barrels a day would be flowing into the stream of production and would help with this supply problem we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There may be other safe ways. A year or so ago, we made a deal. The deal was that we would drill safely in areas well away from the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico--8 million acres for new drilling that are also available and will produce oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are helpful steps, but they are not enough. We have to conserve. We have to find ways to encourage Americans to conserve at the pump, to save by carpooling, to save by finding a way of buying more energy-efficient vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We as a government should be helping American consumers through our tax system to find a way they can purchase vehicles that are more energy efficient. We know that a hybrid vehicle will get 35 to 38 miles to the gallon. We know that a standard vehicle of similar size would be lucky if it gets 17 or 18 miles to the gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, it is a combination of strategies. The bottom line is, we have to have a multifaceted strategy. We have to work together, not suggesting that there is one party that has a secret plan that, in fact, doesn't exist. We have to find a commonsense way to work together, Democrats and Republicans, to increase production modestly and safely, to encourage conservation and new technologies, and to continue to boldly move forward toward a Manhattan-type project that is going to put  all of the resources and energies of this country toward energy independence and energy security so we can discontinue this horrendous practice of wealth transfer that is taking place today between our country--the billions and billions of dollars we are transferring to some of the worst enemies of our country, people such as Hugo Chavez and Ahmadinejad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The day is coming when we have to find a way to pull together toward a common goal of having a sensible, balanced energy policy, increase production safely, conserve more, and new technology. All working together, we can do this. America can meet this challenge.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I can't quite believe what I just heard. Because Democrats in 2006 said we need a different energy policy than the White House, a President and Vice President who both come out of the oil industry, both top energy executives, where much of the funding for the President's party comes from the oil industry, and in 2006, the Democrats said the Congress betrayed the American people because they let the oil industry write the energy bill, now my friend from Florida is saying  it is the Democrats' fault that gas prices are through the roof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the best friends of the President was the CEO of Enron, a major funder to the President, close friend of the President who had a personal nickname, and Enron had gamed the system through speculating and speculating. It cost consumers, especially on the west coast, hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars as people raked off profits from their speculating. We are seeing the same kinds of things. I don't know if they are the President's friends doing it anymore, but I know there are  people who have gamed the system. That is the reason, with no major international incident in the last 2 years, no major outage of a refinery or fire of a refinery or pipeline disruption, that prices have spiked so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that a Justice Department working for the President of the United States, that is not beholden to the oil industry, might actually take some action on price fixing and recommend an excess profits tax--all the kinds of things we could be doing in this body and that the executive could do. But in this body, we have seen filibusters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time we try to do something on oil prices, every time we try to do something on long-term alternative energy, the Republicans filibuster. They have filibustered more than 60 times. It is approaching 70. I am not sure of the number; it is hard to keep up. They have filibustered more times already in this congressional session than they did in any 2-year session in history by a lot, and they are continuing to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would love to sit down with my friend on the other side of the aisle and work on real energy legislation and wean this body and wean the White House from their addiction to oil company campaign dollars, and help wean the American people from our addiction to foreign oil. We would love to work on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced legislation yesterday that will help to jump-start the green energy industry in this country. It is clear we need to do a lot of that. But the American public is tired of finger pointing. It is time this Congress did more on energy, and that the Republicans, instead of filibustering--there are 51 Democrats in this body; we need 60 votes to do anything because of the filibuster--instead of the Republicans holding together and blocking things, instead of filibustering, let us work  together on energy issues and not have the oil companies dictate to this body, as they did for year after year after year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was in the House of Representatives, the oil companies dictated to the House of Representatives leadership, and everybody in those days in the majority party--which was the Republicans then--went along with their leaders on writing an energy bill that had $18 billion of subsidies and giveaways and tax breaks to the oil industry. Yet they are the most profitable industry in America year after year after year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Something gives there. It is time for something very different. I want to work together. The finger pointing should end. Let's sit down and do this right, but don't block us to do things that will help stabilize gas prices now and help to bring them down over the short and medium term and long term to come up with a real energy policy so we are not relying on--as my friend Senator Martinez said--not relying on Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and countries that are not so friendly to us.</paragraph>
