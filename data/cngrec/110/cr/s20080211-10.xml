  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week was a good example of what we can accomplish when we work with instead of against each other. We were able to pass an economic growth package on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, which the President will sign this week. We have another chance in the current week to put up a bipartisan win by passing legislation on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That bill, reported out of the Intelligence Committee, has broad bipartisan support. It  came out of that committee 13 to 2. I am confident with the help of our friends on the other side of the aisle we can work through pending amendments, send this over to the House, and then on to the President for his signature this week before the Protect America Act expires on Sunday.</paragraph>
