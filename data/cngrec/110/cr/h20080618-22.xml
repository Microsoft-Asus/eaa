    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just how long are congressional Republicans going to follow President Bush's lead? Thanks to 7 years of Bush policies, Americans are facing skyrocketing costs for basic necessities. Millions of families have lost their homes, unemployment is rising, and 7 million more Americans are uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You would think any one of these statistics would send congressional Republicans looking for a different solution. Instead, it appears a plan to blindly follow until the finish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President vetoed a bipartisan bill that would provide health coverage to 10 million children, House Republicans stood with President Bush twice in supporting his veto. When the President vetoed legislation for stem cell research that could lead to cures for diseases such as diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's, House Republicans once again stood by President Bush and upheld his veto. Then last week a majority of Republicans refused to provide relief to 3.8 million Americans who are struggling  to find new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When are congressional Republicans going to realize that following President Bush is not the answer?</paragraph>
