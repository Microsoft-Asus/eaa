    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Japanese invaded Guam during World War II, six U.S. servicemen remained on the island. Rather than surrender, these six men fled into the jungle. The Japanese soon learned of their presence and demanded that they turn themselves in. They threatened execution of anyone found helping the American soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these threats, the American soldiers refused to surrender and the people of Guam continued to help them avoid capture. They faced long odds with the Japanese military conducting intense searches of the island, but one soldier, George Tweed, survived. Tweed was later awarded the Legion of Merit medal for his efforts. One of his protectors, Antonio Cruz Artero, was awarded the Medal of Freedom. Countless others who aided Tweed received nothing but the satisfaction of knowing they helped  save the life of a man who symbolized hope for Americans to return and liberate Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's vote will recognize the patriotism of the people of Guam, who risked their lives to save a U.S. serviceman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>.</paragraph>
