  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, later today, we will begin  work on important legislation to finally help America end its dependence on foreign oil and pursue newer, cleaner forms of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm excited that the Energy and Water appropriations bill that we will pass this week will take the long overdue step of setting a new course for our energy future by making significant investments in renewables and efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too many years, working families have felt the sting of high gas prices at the gas pump and rising home energy costs. Our economy has been made vulnerable to the whims of OPEC, and our reliance on fossil fuels has polluted our air and exacerbated climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the while, State and local governments have been forced to try to fill the leadership vacuum left by the Congress and this President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No more. The new Congress is prepared to meet our Nation's energy challenges head-on, and to do so, this bill provides almost $2 billion for renewables and efficiency, significantly more than the President requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned that it continues to provide unwarranted taxpayer subsidies for nuclear power that hide the true consumer costs of this power source, but I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to ratify it.</paragraph>
