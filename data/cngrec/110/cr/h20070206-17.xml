    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of Police Officer Shawn Joshua Dean Williams. Officer Williams died while responding to a fellow officer's call for assistance last Thursday night in Old Fort, North Carolina. He was only 23 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my condolences to his wife, Shannon Kirby Williams; his young daughter, Rye-Lee Alexis; his parents, Max Suttles and mother Holly Williams; and all of his family and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my thoughts and prayers to his fellow Old Fort police officers and the entire law enforcement community in McDowell County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Officer Williams' life was an example of service for all of us to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing remorse at all the passings and the dedication of all law enforcement officers and gratitude to all those who protect and serve our communities every day.</paragraph>
