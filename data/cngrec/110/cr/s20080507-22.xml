    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, Senator Inouye and I celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard has held a significant place in both Hawaii and our Nation's history. Even before Congress passed an act in 1908 officially creating the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard, Pearl Harbor has been an important port for ships and sailors from across the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early in the 19th century, Pearl Harbor, or "Wai-Momi," served as a primary port for exploration and trade. By the late 1800s, the United States was looking toward Pearl Harbor to serve as the center of its expanding Pacific Fleet. On May 13, 1908, Congress solidified Pearl Harbor's strategic importance by appropriating $3 million to officially establish the Navy Yard at Pearl Harbor. Over the next 33 years, the new naval facility at Pearl Harbor was transformed into a site capable of basing  the then-newly formed U.S. Pacific Fleet, and changed the face of Hawaii in the Pacific forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every schoolchild in the United States learns about the events on the morning of December 7, 1941. That was the day the U.S. Naval forces at Pearl Harbor were devastated by the Imperial Japanese Navy's surprise attack. Nine ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet sank, and more than 2,300 American lives were lost. However, our children are taught far less often about the courageous resolve and dedication demonstrated by the shipyard's employees. After resurrecting much of the fleet from the bottom of  Pearl Harbor, and repairing 18 of 21 severely damaged vessels, the workers earned the motto, "We Keep Them Fit to Fight." Their commitment to duty became a model of the U.S. war effort during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effort and hard work by Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard personnel to maintain the ships of the U.S. Navy helped to turn the tide of war at sea in the Battle of Midway. Their tireless work ultimately ensured that of the ships damaged on December 7, salvaged, repaired, and returned to service, one, the USS West Virginia, survived the duration of the war to sail triumphantly into Tokyo Bay in August 1945. The integrity, ethos, and determination of Pearl Harbor Shipyard workers continued throughout  the Cold War, and provided the United States with a national treasure and a strategically critical base of operations for Pacific naval and air power.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the rich history and unflagging service of the men and women at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard highlighted by Senator Akaka continues today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again our Nation is at war, and our Naval Forces engaged in the global war on terror can rely on the shipyard to provide top quality support. The shipyard's work focuses on the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and makes the shipyard the largest repair facility between the west coast of the United States and the Far East. The shipyard provides full-service maintenance for both the Pacific Fleet's ships and submarines throughout the Asia-Pacific theater. In addition to this significant responsibility,  the shipyard has demonstrated its diverse capabilities by supporting our nation's space exploration, Antarctic expeditions, missile defense, and its ability to rapidly respond by deploying worldwide to perform emergency repairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard is a national treasure, and it is known as "No Ka Oi," or "The Best" Shipyard. In the tradition of upholding this moniker, it has earned multiple national awards for its excellent safety and environmental stewardship programs. These awards include the prestigious Occupational Safety and Health Administration Star, and the White House Closing the Circle Environmental Quality Awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the numerous contributions to our U.S. Navy, the shipyard is also an integral part of Hawaii. It is the largest single industrial employer in the State, and its direct annual economic impact is greater than $600 million in Hawaii. Through its apprentice, engineer co-op, and other student hire programs, Hawaii residents are provided with extraordinary training, employment, and career opportunities. For some families this tradition to keep our ships and submarines "fit to fight" runs throughout  a generation  and is being passed down to the next generation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Honor, courage, and commitment are the core values of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. These words speak volumes about both the local and national contributions of the proud men and women who have served under its banner. I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring these outstanding Americans by celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and to wish it as much success over the next century as it attained during the last.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>When Congress established the "Navy Yard Pearl Harbor" in 1908, Hawaii and the U.S. Navy were inextricably linked together. Just as it did in 1908, America understands the need for a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Both the shipyard and its achievements are special. However, it is the shipyard's heart, the dedicated men and women who work there, that make those achievements possible. I join my colleague Senator Akaka in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the  Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and I look forward to celebrating its future successes in the next 100 years.</paragraph>
