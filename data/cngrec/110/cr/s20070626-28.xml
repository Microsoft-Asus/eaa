    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the City of Hastings, NE, for being named "America's Greenest City" by Yahoo, Inc., the online search engine. During a time when people around the world are concerned about energy security and environmental quality, they need look no further than the city of Hastings as a perfect example of what a community can do to help clean up the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hastings, with a population of 25,000, located in south-central Nebraska, has just won Yahoo's "Be a Better Planet-- Greenest City in America" challenge, beating 350 other cities across the Nation which had entered the competition. Some of the environmental projects accomplished by the city of Hastings include conversion of methane to energy at its pollution control center, production of E85 ethanol, installation of energy-efficient street lighting,  and creation of an extensive network of parks and hiking and biking trails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hastings, NE, the birthplace of Kool-Aid, is in the heart of farm country, which most certainly contributed to its environmentally sound policies. Farmers have always been leaders when it comes to being good stewards of the land, water, and air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For its efforts, Yahoo offered the city of Hastings its choice of either a fleet of hybrid taxi cabs, similar to those donated to New York City during the campaign's kickoff on May 14, 2007, or the equivalent cash donation. Hastings, which has signed the U.S. Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement, selected the latter in order to further its environmental programs and become an even greener city. In addition to the top prize awarded to Hastings, the top five cities are being rewarded with deliveries  of thousands of energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs, compliments of Yahoo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hastings mayor Matt Rossen plans to solicit ideas from residents for future projects, and Global Green USA will also work with the city of Hastings to identify potential city greening projects, such as expansion of renewable energy programs and energy-efficient renovations for city buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Nebraska's Senator, I am extremely proud of Hastings, NE, which has shown an outstanding commitment to the development of renewable and sustainable energy solutions for protecting the environment, improving health, and saving money. In commending the city of Hastings, NE, for being named America's Greenest City, I wish to highlight the sentiments expressed by Yahoo's cofounder, David Filo, who said, "The determined green spirit demonstrated by the people of Hastings, Nebraska, underscores  Yahoo's belief that individual actions can add up to significant change."</paragraph>
