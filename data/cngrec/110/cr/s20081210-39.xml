    <paragraph>Madam President, Mr. Thomas W. Richardson of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will soon retire with over 37 years of exceptional service to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He is member of the Senior Executive Service and is the Director of Corps' Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal Hydraulic Laboratory. His accomplishments and dedication to the Corps of Engineers' laboratory community and the Army are exceptional and will have a significant and long lasting positive  impact on this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following 3 years of service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mr. Richardson began his Army civilian career in 1974 as a research hydraulic engineer at the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, in Vicksburg, MS. Through the 1970s and early 1980s he was a principal investigator for research studies on dredging systems for beach nourishment for offshore sources and an assistant investigator on a research study to develop new systems for bypassing sand past tidal inlets.  During this time he designed and constructed the world's first portable, land-based hydraulic sand bypassing system, which was delivered to the Corps of Engineers North Central Division as an operational plant. A systematic approach became available to address a major national concern with both economic and strategic aspects; that of bypassing sand to preserve beaches and to maintain harbor channels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1983, Mr. Richardson became chief of the coastal structures and evaluation branch, Coastal Engineering Research Center where he supervised 16 researchers specializing in functional design and performance of coastal structures, dredging and sand bypassing systems, geomorphic evaluation, and empirical design methods for coastal projects. From branch chief he quickly moved up to division chief in 1985 and served in that capacity for 14 years, first as chief of the Engineering Development Division  and then as the Chief of the Coastal Sediments and Engineering Division. He directed numerous comprehensive research and development investigations, and studies of coastal processes, sediment transport, shoreline change modeling, beach fill design methods, prototype systems design and development,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Richardson assumed the duties of acting assistant lab director in January 2000. In June of that same year, he was elevated to acting director, CHL. Mr. Richardson joined the Senior Executive Service in March 2002 upon becoming director of the CHL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Mr. Richardson, the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory directly supported the Army transformation, civil works strategic plan, global war on terrorism operations, and high priority civil works operations. In addition, CHL addressed critical levee issues for the Department of Homeland Security by developing a unique system to rapidly repair breaches in levees caused by natural phenomena or terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Tom Richardson has demonstrated a profound commitment to the Army, the Corps of Engineers, and the Nation. He is a consummate professional whose performance in over 37 years of service has personified those traits of competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect of its senior civilian leaders. I congratulate Mr. Richardson on his distinguished service to the U.S. Army and the Nation.</paragraph>
