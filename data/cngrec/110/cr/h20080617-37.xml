  <speaking speaker="400163" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1029, congratulating and recognizing Mr. Juan Antonio "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez for his continued success on and off the golf course, for his generosity and devotion to charity and for his dedication to the intellectual and moral growth of thousands of low-income and disadvantaged youth in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have introduced this resolution honoring a great American. Chi-Chi Rodriguez was born the fifth of six children to an agricultural worker and to a housekeeper in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. From these humble beginnings, he rose to become one of the Nation's most talented professional golfers, using his skills and status to benefit others. Chi-Chi is distinguished as a great humanitarian and role model for children across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chi-Chi joined the ranks of professional golfers at the age of 24, and over the next four decades, he earned 38 professional wins, including 8 PGA tour wins and 22 Senior PGA tour wins. In 1979, Chi-Chi Rodriguez had used his national recognition as a great sportsman to help found the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation and the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Academy, which have collectively raised $4 million to assist disadvantaged youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chi-Chi Rodriguez Foundation has been honored by the National Golf Association, by the Jackie Robinson Foundation and by the Points of Light Foundation for its youth and community service efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chi-Chi also joined with the FBI Agents Association to create the Chi-Chi Rodriguez G-Man Desert Shootout Tournament in order to fund college scholarships for the children of those FBI agents who have been killed in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chi-Chi has been heard to say, "For me, satisfaction comes from knowing that I was put on this planet to make it better." This philosophy has guided his life and has made him an example of dedication and generosity of spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as Members of Congress, one of our great honors is to recognize our fellow citizens who stand out as exceptional individuals. I am proud to support this resolution, honoring a great Puerto Rican-American humanitarian.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1029">H. Res. 1029</bill>, which congratulates and recognizes Mr. Juan Antonio "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez for his success on the golf course, for his devotion to charity and for his dedication to the intellectual and moral development of low-income and disadvantaged youth throughout our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rodriguez' knack for golf began at a young age. He learned to play golf with makeshift golf clubs fashioned from guava tree limbs and from tin cans hammered into golf balls. He shot a remarkable 67 at age 12. By the end of his professional career, he had won 22 Senior PGA tour events and the hearts of many Americans with his trademark toreador dance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of what makes Mr. Rodriguez such a remarkable individual is that he took his own professional accomplishments and channeled them into the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation, which supports the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Academy, which is in my congressional district. Starting in 1979 and with just 17 students, the mission of the academy is to assist at-risk children by improving their self-esteem, character, work ethic, social adjustment, and academic performance by using the golf course as a classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The academy encompasses a public-private partnership school that fosters  students' achievements through interactive experiences in various real-world business environments: The First Tee of Clearwater, incorporating life skills with golf skills; the After School Enrichment program, reinforcing and furthering academic studies; and the Community Service program, designed to help students fulfill their graduation and scholarship volunteer service hour requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my kids have had the honor of meeting Mr. Rodriguez, and I have had the pleasure of seeing firsthand his good work in my district. Mr. Rodriguez, after meeting with Mother Teresa, embraced her lesson of living to help other people, and he has served as an inspiration to thousands of young men and women over the past three decades. His unique idea to teach the important life skills of self-control, responsibility and respect for others to at-risk youth while maintaining an atmosphere  that builds confidence and positive educational experiences through golf is truly commendable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great admiration that I rise today to honor the accomplishments of Mr. Chi-Chi Rodriguez by supporting this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1029">H. Res. 1029</bill>, which recognizes as well as congratulates Mr. Juan Antonio "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez for his continued success on and off the golf course, for his generosity and devotion to charity and for his exemplary dedication to the positive development of thousands of low-income and disadvantaged youth in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1029">H. Res. 1029</bill> was authored by Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and is cosponsored by 52 Members of Congress. The bill before us was first introduced on March 6, 2008 and was taken up by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on June 12, 2008 where the measure was amended and then passed by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, Juan "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez is recognized as one of the greatest golfers of our time, and he is the first Puerto Rican professional golfer to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. With over 37 professional golf wins, including 8 PGA tour wins and 22 Senior PGA tour wins, Mr. Rodriguez rose from sugarcane cutter to world-renowned professional golfer and youth advocate, which is a great indication of one who need not be so concerned about where one comes  from but in recognizing where one will be going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rodriguez, obviously, went to the very top. Not only did he stand out as a professional golfer, but as a humanitarian and as an individual who gave back and gave to others, he will always be renowned and remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleague for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, no one is a better example of energy, of doing more with less than is Chi-Chi Rodriguez. Not only did he begin golfing at age 6 and shoot a 67 at age 12, but in fact, for a man who never rose above 5'7" in height or 130 pounds in weight, he has one of the most famous long balls in golf. That is the energy of Chi-Chi Rodriguez, an energy that America covets. He is somebody who doesn't let size or any other limitation keep him from achieving his goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier, the gentleman from Florida talked about Florida and Chi-Chi Rodriguez' activities there in Clearwater. Florida brings to mind that, when you talk about a man of energy, just 50 miles off the coast of Florida, China and Cuba are now issuing contracts that are going to allow for drilling, for drilling closer to America than we allow, just 50 miles off the coast of Florida, in fact, without the kind of safeguards that American companies would use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So when I think of Florida and I think of a man of energy, I think of the energy that is being kept away from the American people, energy that would keep our dollars from flowing to countries less friendly to us, energy that would make us self-sufficient and self-reliant, and energy that would heat our homes and fuel our cars at a cost far less than what we are paying today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I truly think of energy when I think of Chi-Chi Rodriguez, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Chi-Chi Rodriguez and urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Juan Antonio "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez was a native Puerto Rican who overcame the obstacles of poverty and became recognized as a renowned professional golfer, and a true inspiration to the Latino community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rodriguez has had nothing less than an exceptional career as a professional golfer. Among his many accomplishments, Mr. Rodriguez has a total of 38 professional wins, including 8 PGA tour wins, 22 Senior PGA wins, and wins in the Bahamas, Colombia, and in Panama. Because of Chi-Chi's distinguished sportsmanship throughout his career, in 1989 he was awarded the Bob Jones Award, which is the highest award given by the United States Golf Association. In 1989, he was also awarded the Tom Morris  Award, from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America. In 1992, Chi-Chi was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame This was a remarkable accomplishment because he was the first Puerto Rican honored into this elite group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rodriguez has not only been an inspiration on the course, but through his charitable work as well. He established the "Chi-Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation", an after school program at the Glen Oaks Golf Course in Clearwater, Florida. Chi-Chi and his staff work with children to improve their self-esteem, character, work ethic, social adjustment, and academic performance. His humanitarian work allowed him to be recognized as an inaugural inductee into the World Humanitarian Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Juan "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez leads an exemplary life of public service and gives hope to the underprivileged children of America. He has used his success in his professional career to make a positive impact in many people's lives. Mr. Rodriguez is deserving of the utmost respect and recognition for his contributions to the youth of America. That is why I support <bill type="hr" number="1029">H. Res. 1029</bill>, introduced by Mr. GUTIERREZ of Illinois.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="1029">H. Res. 1029</bill>, recognizing Chi-Chi Rodriguez for his generosity and work with low-income and disadvantaged youth in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chi-Chi is famous for his success on the golf course. He was a self-taught golfer that started out fusing a branch from a guava tree for a club and a metal can as a ball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then went on to win 8 titles on the PGA tour and represented our country as a member of the 1973 U.S. Ryder Cup team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a true ambassador of the game, and a role model for all Latino golfers, including myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his childhood in the sugar cane fields of Puerto Rico, to the World Golf Hall of Fame, Chi-Chi has lived the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What most people don't know about Chi-Chi is his dedication to working with underprivileged kids. He inspires others to pursue their dreams as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Academy, kids learn valuable lessons to help them in life--respect, confidence, honesty, responsibility, integrity, and sportsmanship, to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under-achieving students with behavioral problems and learning disabilities get free help at Chi-Chi's academy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution recognizes Chi-Chi's continuing efforts to improve the lives of thousands of low-income and disadvantaged youth in our country, I encourage my colleagues to join with me and honor Mr. Juan Antonio "Chi-Chi" Rodriguez.</paragraph>
