    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to let all of our troops serving overseas know that America supports you. Eliminating or cutting funding for our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States is not a recipe for ensuring stability in the Middle East; in fact, it is a recipe for demoralization, and it is irresponsible in its proposal. I urge all Members to support our troops and oppose any effort to cut off or restrict funding for American troops in harm's way, whether in Iraq,  in Afghanistan, or elsewhere in the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we fully support those who are on the front lines fighting the war on terror. America thanks you, our brave men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
