  <narrative>LET'S STICK TO OUR GUNS -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14088]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. MORAN of Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, what do you know, Mr. Speaker. After months of drum beat urging that we take a more aggressive posture toward Iran, mention by the President of a potential World War III, the assumptions, the assertions by the White House that Iran is aggressively pursuing a nuclear weapons program, we now find that as with Iraq, this was not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, differently from what happened with Iraq, this time those professional, courageous civil servants in our national intelligence agencies stood up to intimidation from the White House and spoke the truth objectively and detailed it with facts. We're very proud of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the more reason why we should not yield to the President's threats to furlough over 200,000 civilian employees and contractors just before Christmas unless the Congress approves another $50 billion in war spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to stick to our guns. We've approved $459 billion in defense spending. That's enough.</paragraph>
