    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we start a new year, one of the things that we are seeing in the economy is signs of stress. The unemployment is rising somewhat, we see the trouble with the housing market, the savings and loan crisis. Over the past year, the Chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, warned that the Democrat tax increases increasingly threaten our economy. Last year, the Democrats passed a $528 billion tax increase here in the House and proposed the mother of all tax increases, a $3.5 trillion  tax increase, the largest in the history of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is exactly the wrong medicine in an economy that is struggling. Instead, what we should be doing is we should be returning a portion of that money that people earn so that it can be invested and strengthen the economy and put us back on the road to recovery, just as we did in 2001 and 2002. It's time for us to understand that tax increases are exactly the wrong medicine when the economy is struggling. I hope the Democrats remember that.</paragraph>
