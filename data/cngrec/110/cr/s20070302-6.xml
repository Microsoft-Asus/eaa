    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to immediately resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>. At 10 a.m., there will be two rollcall votes, first with respect to the Sununu amendment regarding cross-border interoperability. The second vote is in respect to the Salazar amendment regarding rural policing. These will be the only votes today. Members are welcome to stay after the votes and offer amendments and speak on amendments that are pending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One amendment that has generated a lot of controversy within the Senate and outside of this body is the DeMint amendment. I hope Members will come and speak about it. As staff has talked, I have mentioned briefly to the Republican leader what we would like to do. Monday night, we will have several votes. We will have more than one vote at 5:30. What I would like to do is on Tuesday have McCaskill and DeMint in the morning. The only thing we have to work out is how much time has to be spent on  the DeMint amendment prior to a vote. We hope Senators will come and talk about those matters this afternoon and Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat, Members have the opportunity this afternoon and Monday. We will come in at whatever time we think is appropriate. If we get word that Senators want to offer amendments, we can come in earlier rather than later so that Members may offer amendments and speak about them and so we can move to conclusion of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members have been previously informed that we would be voting on March 5. I am surprised that March is here already, but it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have done well on this bill. I have been satisfied--I think everybody has been--with the demeanor of the debate. It has been very good.</paragraph>
