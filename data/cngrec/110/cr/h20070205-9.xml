    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Chicago, a 22-year-old woman is suing a Spanish language radio station. It seems she won a Corvette in the station's raffle, but the station won't give it to her. Why? Because she would not produce any identification. You see, a valid Social Security number or taxpayer identification number is required by law of the winner to get this type of prize because the winner must pay Federal taxes on the Corvette. The radio station strictly adheres to FCC contest rules. This  person did not have either document. Why? Because she is illegally in the United States and because she won't pay the taxes, so the Corvette was withheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never mind the station followed the law and the illegal is breaking the law by being in our country. She is now suing the radio station because she wants the Vette. She is also suing because of emotional distress. What arrogance this illegal has. The lawsuit should be thrown out of court, and when she gets to the courthouse they should put her in the jailhouse and deport her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
