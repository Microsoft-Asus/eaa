  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate is now back on the Amtrak bill that Senator Lott and I have been working on together for many years. I am glad we are moving closer to passing this bipartisan legislation. Our bill has had wide support with over 40 cosponsors. This is our fifth day on the Amtrak bill, and we have made very good progress. We have been able to work through most amendments. Some we were able to agree to, while some required votes. We still have a few amendments,  however, we need to address. But we should be able to finish this bill soon, hopefully today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical that we do so. When we think about how crowded our roads are, the high price of gasoline, airport delays as an alternative, the potential fuel savings and reduction in greenhouse gases from more people riding the trains, the need for multiple modes of transportation for evacuations during emergencies, rail is a critical answer to our needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for multiple modes of transportation for evacuations during emergencies is a critical factor, and rail is one very important answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know people will ride the train when there is service available. Amtrak set a new company record of almost 26 million passengers in the last fiscal year. We have seen successes in the Northeast corridor between Boston and New York and through New Jersey to Washington, but there is no reason why we can't have world-class rail service in other regions of the country. Many States are ready to develop new rail corridors, and our bill is going to meet this need by creating a new State grant program  for rail projects. In all, it would authorize almost $2 billion a year for Amtrak and for the States over the next 6 years. Instead of barely giving Amtrak enough resources to survive, our bill paves the way for an improved, modern passenger rail network</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to overseeing use of taxpayer funds, our bill requires that Amtrak improve its efficiency and its management. Overall, we require a 40-percent reduction in Federal operating subsidies over 6 years. We require a new financial accounting system to increase the transparency of the company's financial management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last Congress, our bipartisan compromise bill plan was approved by the Senate 93 to 6. I hope we will see a similar showing of support in this Chamber later today. America's travelers have been through terrible inconveniences, missed appointments, total unreliability. Now they are relying on us to provide practical and convenient travel options and passenger rail service must be one of them.</paragraph>

FOOD AND BEVERAGE SERVICE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Quarterly Report.--The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (referred to in this section as "Amtrak") shall submit a quarterly report to Congress and to the Secretary of Transportation that sets forth the profit or loss, as applicable, relating to the provision of food and beverage service on each rail line operated by Amtrak.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Contract Renegotiation.--If the food and beverage service on a specific Amtrak rail line incurs a loss in any fiscal year, Amtrak shall renegotiate any applicable contracts relating to food and beverage service (including associated labor contracts) for such rail line in an effort to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) reduce the cost of such service; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) increase to likelihood to make a profit in the following fiscal year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Discontinuance.--If the food and beverage service on a specific Amtrak rail line incurs a loss in any 2 consecutive fiscal years, Amtrak shall terminate such service on such rail line.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Reinstatement.--Amtrak may reinstate food and beverage service that was discontinued under subsection (c) if--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) at least 1 year has elapsed since the date on which such service was discontinued on the applicable rail line;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Amtrak submits a credible proposal to Congress and to the Secretary of Transportation for generating food and beverage service profits on such rail line for each of the following 5 fiscal years; and</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment. Last night, at 11 o'clock, I arrived at Union Station, taking the Acela Express from New York City to Washington. It is a great value, with good service. It is one of the areas where Amtrak makes money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what the American public needs to see about this bill--and I am going to talk about in this amendment, specifically--is we are right here now at this level, as shown on this chart, and total subsidies will not go down, they will go up over the next 5 years for Amtrak. If you consider operating subsidies and capital subsidies, here is where they are, as shown on this chart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are going to have is about a $600 million increase between now and 2012 in the amount the American taxpayers are going to subsidize Amtrak. That may be something we want to do. This amendment specifically deals with an area where Amtrak can make a difference right now, and it is on food service. Over the last 3 years, American taxpayers have subsidized food service on Amtrak to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars. Now, anybody who travels knows when you get on American Airlines,  you can buy a Milky Way candy bar for $3. The same thing costs 75 cents on Amtrak. They know you can buy a beer for $5. It costs $3 on Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is it we have food programs and food sales programs that the American taxpayer is subsidizing on Amtrak that we refuse to subsidize on airlines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have heard during this debate that, well, we subsidize Amtrak,  but we subsidize all the rest of them. Here is the analysis of the Department of Transportation on how much we do subsidize the other forms of transportation in this country. It is pretty revealing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are driving a car, you are paying in to the Federal Government. It is a negative subsidy. You, the individual driver, are paying $1.79, for every 1,000 miles you drive, to the Federal Government--just for the privilege of you driving. But if you are riding a bus, it is a $4.66 subsidy from us, the taxpayers, to us, the bus riders. If you are flying on an airplane, the subsidy is $6.18 for every 1,000 miles we travel. It is what we pay us to fly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you get to public transit, it is quite a bit bigger. Could you make justifications for that? I am not saying we should not. But when you get to Amtrak, we are talking about $210 per thousand miles traveled, on average. We know on certain rail lines, certain routes, there is not much subsidy, Amtrak actually makes money. They have slightly improved in certain areas, especially with their latest data. But $210?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you take their total subsidy, which right now is $1.3 billion--which counts all the subsidies, both capital and others--if you were to take out the losses on food, you would save another $125 million to $150 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nobody expects, when you get on Amtrak rail passenger service, that the rest of us ought to pay for your beer. Nobody expects we ought to pay for your 3 Musketeers candy bar. Yet, in essence, that is what is happening on Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is fairly straightforward. What it says is three things:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It says Amtrak has to calculate and report quarterly to the Department of Transportation and Congress on the quarterly profits and losses, by route or rail line, of food and beverage services. What that means is they ought to know where they are losing their money, and we ought to know where they are losing their money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing it says is, Amtrak ought to restructure their food and beverage service contracts for any rail line that is losing money on its food and beverage services. This is not rocket science. This is that if you are going to sell it, you ought to at least sell it for enough to cover the cost. Yet we continue to not do that. We continue not to want to hold them accountable to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then finally, if they cannot present a way to be able to sell food and beverages at a break-even cost at least, then they ought to have to discontinue selling food or have a food service on it. And they have done it on one line because it was losing so much money. The question is, why haven't they either raised the prices or done it on the other lines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this amendment is is a management audit tool for Amtrak that says: You are going to tell us every 3 months by route where you are making your money. They need to know that anyhow. They don't right now. They do not account for it right now. They cannot tell you how much by line or route they are making or losing on food service. Any manager of any process knows if you do not know the information, if you do not have the metrics, you cannot manage it. If you do not have the metrics, you cannot  manage it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history in this debate on Amtrak is interesting, because in 1997, the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 was supposed to solve all the problems, and by 2003 we were not supposed to have a subsidy in Amtrak. That is what the bill said. It said we will, in fact, by 2003 solve this drain of $1.3 billion per year coming out of everybody else's hands into those people who ride Amtrak. We have not had an authorization since 2003. This bill claims that, in fact, the subsidies will go down.  But they will not. That is their numbers. That is the bill's numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now we are saying we are fixing the problem--except the problem continues to grow. If, in fact, we would fix the food service portion of this, the subsidies would do this, as shown on this chart. It would be a flat line. There would be no increase in subsidies--capital or otherwise--if, in fact, we were breaking even on all the food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a straightforward amendment. I know there is some consternation with this amendment by the authors of the bill and the managers of the bill. I understand that. But the fact is, it is hard to explain to the American people why we are subsidizing a 3 Musketeers candy bar and a package of pretzels and a can of beer for people who ride Amtrak--and we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting; I fly every week, and my total travel time is 8 hours each way. I price bottles of water at airports. A bottle of water on Amtrak is $1.99. Do you know what the average price is for a bottle of water at airports in this country? And that is not even on the airplane. It is $2.49. Yet we are selling it 20 percent cheaper on Amtrak than you can buy it in an airport. If you buy it at a convenience store, you can buy it for 99 cents. But we have a captive audience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The airlines know how to take advantage of that, and we are not subsidizing them, except for the $6, which we  pointed out, per 1,000 miles. That comes to 6 cents a mile, by the way, versus $21 a mile for those on Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my hope is we will at least look at this issue and say: OK, if you are not going to manage it, at least look at the food side of it. Measure it. Then, if we want to come back in a year and take this amendment away, saying: OK, you have done it--with this amendment, if they start breaking even on the food, it does not have any effect on them, other than reporting. If they are not going to break even on their food and beverage service, what it says is: Give us a plan to show how you are going  to do it. It is very simple. But if you are not going to do either of those, then stop losing money on food service and beverage service on Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Mississippi.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking Senator Coburn for getting involved in the process. He made some requests last week in terms of needing more time to actually look at this legislation and think about amendments that should be offered. Senator Reid agreed to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator DeMint and Senator Coburn have both kept their commitments. Senator DeMint offered a number of amendments. We have cleared, I think, four of them, and we are working on some others. Senator Coburn came up with two very serious amendments he is interested in and has indicated he would agree to a limited time for debate and have a vote. So I want to acknowledge that, first of all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I too am concerned about some of the costs we have had at Amtrak. In fact, the last time we passed Amtrak reform, I included a provision in that legislation to allow food to be contracted out. Up until that point, it could not even be contracted out. It was all done in-house with Amtrak, and there was no good reason why that should have been limited that way. They still have not gotten the costs where they should be. But the opportunity is there for them to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want them to continue to work to get better prices and cut the subsidies, cut the costs, and also while providing good food. But I do think food--whether you are on an airplane or a train--is an important part of the service. I am not going to take an Amtrak passenger train from some remote area that is going to be on the rail for a day or maybe even overnight and not have  any food service. If you wipe out food service, you might as well terminate  the route.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think this is an amendment that deserves discussion and consideration. This amendment, as I understand it, would require Amtrak to regularly report to Congress on the profits or losses relating to the provision of food and beverage service. We ought to have that. We ought to have all kinds of reports. It ought to be transparent. We ought to know where the costs are, where the profits are. We should increase the profits and cut the costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to say you should limit such service on Amtrak lines that incur losses, what you are saying is you would have to terminate the lines because if you do not have food service, what are you going to do? Have a brown bag? Bring a lunch? Raise the price? I am for that. I think you ought to pay the costs for doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if we say: "OK, if you cannot get this under control, we are going to terminate the line," what if the line is actually doing pretty good, but the food service is still costing too much? We should keep the pressure on, but I do not think we can, in good conscience, deny passengers food and beverage service on these long-distance rails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak ought to lead more. They ought to address this question of food costs and get those costs down. I must say, we have not had particularly good success in the Senate either. We have had trouble controlling our food costs. But we have heard the stories about airline passengers stranded on planes with no food, and they could not get off the planes, and the kind of consternation that has caused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike air travelers who may deboard and maybe purchase food during layovers, rail passengers do not have time during stops to get off and come back on. Even if they could, most Amtrak stations do not have snack bars. There is the question of what, in reality, your options are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in corridor service, we know providing food and beverage is essential. The improved food service, for instance, on the Acela contributed to a 20-percent increase in revenues during 2007. Of course, that is the gold standard. If all of Amtrak service was like the Acela, serving the numbers of people with the quality of service they have, and all that, then we would be a lot better off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Department of Transportation inspector general found that Amtrak has reduced its food and beverage labor costs by $12 million over the past 3 fiscal years. I think pressure from the last Amtrak bill has been leading to this. They understand they have to do a better job. We believe that number can drop even further. <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill> will reduce subsidies by 40 percent over the life of the bill. This includes section 210, which requires Amtrak to reevaluate onboard amenities and service, including  food for these long-distance rail routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want reform. We are pressing on this issue, and it is in the bill. In fact, I think some people, when they actually read this bill, have been surprised there are reforms in there, there are improvements that are going to be demanded. People might say we need even more. That is a legitimate argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that has been our goal. We want Amtrak to provide better service. We want Amtrak to be able to not lose money, to actually make money. But we want to have the national rail passenger system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this amendment, if a particular rail line suffers a loss on a food service, then they would be required to renegotiate the contract relating to food and beverage, including labor contracts. You might say: Well, even that may not be bad. But if a particular rail line suffers a loss in two consecutive years, they would be required to terminate food service on that line. Therein lies the problem. Amtrak would be permitted to reinstate food and beverage service on a discounted line only after  a 1-year moratorium and the Secretary certifies a profit for food and beverage service would be generated on such rail line for each of the following 5 fiscal years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do agree this is a problem that should be able to be addressed. They just ought to do it. There is a simple solution: You change the service. You raise your costs. You get a different contractor. There are a lot of options. We should continue to press this point, but I don't think we ought to make it such that we wind up having to terminate service if we can't get the food situation straightened out. I don't think it is necessary given the other reforms that we have included in this bill. It  goes too far, but I understand the intent. I want this service--I want improvement. I want the cost to come down. But I want a national rail passenger service. I have learned from past experience, don't mess with people's stomachs or you will get in real trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that connection I will not read the entire piece, but I refer to an article from Parade magazine that will be printed on November 4, 2007. Some of what it says is that with plane delays and high gas prices, Americans are asking: Can we save our trains? It goes into some detail about all of the delays and inconveniences and problems now--the congestion on our highways, the delays, the discomforts on airlines--and people are asking: Is there another alternative? That alternative should be a  national rail passenger system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, surely, the Government and Amtrak, we could all do a better job of making it a good experience and living within their means. They have not done that. This bill, hopefully, in its present form, or with additional amendments that can be added, will pressure Amtrak to provide this service because I think we are going to need it for the future transportation needs of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, everybody knows the Senator from Oklahoma is meticulous in terms of his anxiousness to reduce the costs of Government in any way we can. That certainly is what is being attempted in this bill that Senator Lott and I have introduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment the Senator from Oklahoma has offered will slowly but surely eliminate one crucial component of Amtrak service, and that is its food and beverage service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passengers who take Amtrak's long-distance trains may be in transit for as long as 2 or 3 days, and some may be diabetic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike airports, most Amtrak stations don't have restaurants or snack bars where you can pick up a bite before you get on the train.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time do we have available?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Just a little over 1 minute.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will summarize very quickly to say that on these long rides, a person may be diabetic, may need food. It is part of what rail transportation offers, and it attracts more passengers to know that they can be comfortable and still have some nourishment along the way. If we want to reduce subsidies, then we ought to look at the airlines where we are subsidizing them to the tune of $15 billion a year and say cut out the mini pretzels, cut out the little bag of nuts.  It costs a lot of money when you multiply it by all of the passengers who get on airplanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The objective is to make Amtrak a more viable part of our transportation network, and I hope we will not start to pick things apart. Maybe we ought to look at what they do mechanically; see whether we can reduce a mechanic here or there. That is not what we want to do. All of this is going to be reported. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his amendment, but I am going to oppose it, and I hope all of our colleagues will.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is interesting that two-thirds of the airlines don't have pretzels anymore because they have to make a profit, and they have to report to their shareholders. So it is not there anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard a statement that subsidies have been reduced by 40 percent. That is the operating subsidies. The total subsidies haven't been reduced at all. They are actually going up. They are actually going up by this amount over the next 5 years. These are Amtrak's numbers, based on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the numbers of the Department of Transportation, based on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you would break even on food service, there wouldn't be an increase in total subsidies. But none of us would  run a business with a loss leader that would continue to undermine our ability to put the capital into business and to stay in business. We would, in fact, make a change. This amendment gives them 2 years. It says, the first year--you get 2 years to lose money, so the first year if you have lost money, renegotiate it, raise your prices,  cut your labor costs. The cost of food service on Amtrak is 52 percent labor costs. The average person doling out the food on Amtrak makes twice what somebody does in the private sector doing the same thing. So what we really have is a subsidy to the food service workers on Amtrak because that is 52 percent of the cost, rather than a subsidy to the food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the question the American people ought to ask is, should we be subsidizing somebody's beer and 3 Musketeers on Amtrak when we don't do it anywhere else? Isn't it common sense that if you are going to offer food service, you at least ought to break even?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we know from the testimony of the head of Amtrak is they use it as a loss leader. The only problem is where they use it as a loss leader, they continue to lose more money. On their profitable routes, they make money on food service. So the question is, should we, in fact, subsidize food? Nobody wants a diabetic not to have food available, and that would not happen. That is why we put 2 years in here. The first year you recognize you have a problem, and the second year you fix it. This isn't  an amendment that is designed to get rid of service in terms of train routes. This is an amendment that says none of us would run a business losing this kind of money. It is a quarter of a billion dollars the last 3 years lost on food, on Amtrak--a quarter of a billion dollars.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the Senator yield for a quick question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am happy to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Knowing the situation that we run into with the airlines where the people are stuck for hours at a time, is it a good idea to eliminate--as the Senator suggested, we are happy that we eliminated pretzels on the airlines. Is that a good idea?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the difference is, that becomes a management decision of the airline, which has to compete. Amtrak has no competition. They have no competition. So, therefore, they continue to do things, because we will subsidize them, that somebody in the private sector would not do. That is a decision that is made that says--American Airlines saved $30 million last year by their restriction of food services. It was in the paper today, $30 million they saved on all the routes by a  restriction of the food service. To them, in an airline industry that has been struggling, that is a significant amount of money. You know what. We still flew American Airlines; we just bought it before we got on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statement that there is no food available in all of the Amtrak stops is not true. That is true in the most remote areas, but there is food available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we, in fact, would pass this amendment, and Amtrak would run the food service like any other business would run it, this number would become a flat line. In other words, we would go up here and then we would come across, and the American taxpayer would save about $1 billion over the next 5 years if, in fact, we would do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the opposition--I want to finish my point. The opposition to this amendment is the fear that we may lose a route because we may not offer food service. I would be happy to offer----</paragraph>

I would be happy to offer the managers of this amendment, to make a second degree to this amendment that says on long-haul routes, if, in fact, there is no possibility you can never do it on a certain subsidy level, I will be happy to accept that. The purpose is that--we lose a quarter of a billion dollars subsidizing somebody's Heineken every day, every year, when we have this system where we don't make a management decision that is in the best interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the real reason the decisions aren't made on food service. It is because they don't have to be because we are still going to put the money there. That is the real reason why it is not there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the private sector, it would have happened already. If there were private trains competing, I guarantee the prices would be higher for the food component of it. Nobody is going to lose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is a straightforward amendment. I have a couple of minutes left, and I am happy to yield for a question from the Senator from New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator if he was aware that we differ on the amount of subsidy that goes into rail service food costs. It is only $80 million as we see it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How would a rejection of all loss for food eliminate all subsidies, when, in fact, we subsidize the airlines that are for-profit businesses? Why should we then continue to offer them----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, the reason we do is we subsidize for $6 per 1,000 miles traveled on the airlines, and we subsidize $210 per 1,000 miles of travel on the railroad. That is a significant reason we ought to be all the more efficient with what we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator is correct. The last year, we only subsidized $80 million worth of food, but on average, every 3 years, it is a quarter of a billion dollars. That was my statement. So ask yourself, should we be subsidizing $80 million worth of food on Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a straightforward, commonsense amendment that most Americans would say makes sense. We at least ought to cover the cost. If we can't cover the cost, then maybe we ought to renegotiate the contracts with the food service workers who make $43,000 a year who are selling you a bottle of water. Compare that to somebody who is working at an airport or a stewardess on an airplane who is serving you and who is making less than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the consequences of our actions have great impact. Why is it important? Is it because of the subsidy we give Amtrak? Do you know what it is? It is borrowed from our grandkids. We can't deny it. We have the administration claiming a $160 billion deficit this year, and the real deficit is going to be $300 billion because we are going to borrow $140 billion from Social Security to pay for Medicare, and then we are going to borrow $200 billion to pay for a war that we are charging to our grandkids.  So that is important because the subsidy isn't coming from us. It is coming from the next two generations.</paragraph>
