  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="BROIN FAMILY GENEROSITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the Todd and Linda Broin family of Sioux Falls, SD, and applaud their generosity. Through a charitable gift to the Sanford Project, the Broins have made a major contribution in the global effort to cure type 1 diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sanford Project, an initiative of one of South Dakota's health care systems, seeks to focus research efforts on one critical health care issue with the goal of making significant process toward curing or otherwise eliminating the disease. Last month, Sanford Project leaders announced their focus on curing type 1 diabetes, with a specific emphasis on beta cell regeneration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Type 1 diabetes, also called juvenile diabetes, is a severe disease with no known cause or cure that affects nearly 3 million Americans and their families. Linda Broin's own experience with type 1 diabetes, stemming from her diagnosis with the disease at age 12, makes this contribution all the more personal, and inspirational. The Broins' generosity will allow for the establishment of the Todd and Linda Broin, chair, of the Sanford Project, and their gift will be used to support the salary and  related expenses of the person who leads the campaign to cure type 1 diabetes. I am extremely pleased the Sanford Project is dedicating health research resources to cure type 1 diabetes, and, like so many others, I am grateful that the Broins' gift will advance the recruitment of top researchers to lead this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diabetes is a severe disease that can result in a range of disabilities, including blindness, amputations, and kidney failure. Given the cost of diabetes not only to Americans' health, but also to our personal finances and our economy, it is clear that funding for diabetes research and prevention needs to be a priority. Biomedical research is the key to solving unanswered questions regarding this disease and holds the potential to impact millions of lives. While government funding clearly plays  an important role in fueling research, the Broins' private contribution provides vital flexibility and garners even greater interest for the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased the Sanford Project's efforts have been amplified and I commend the Broin family's generosity in their gift and efforts to increase awareness about this disease.</paragraph>
