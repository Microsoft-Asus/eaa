    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a special privilege to welcome today's guest chaplain, the Reverend Dr. John Ross, Senior Minister of Wayzata Community Church in Wayzata, MN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the entire House, thank you, J.R., as Dr. Ross is known back home, for your moving and very timely prayer and for serving as guest chaplain here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Dr. Ross and his wonderful wife, Sheila, very well as Kathryn and I, our family are members of Wayzata Community Church. We are proud to call Dr. Ross our senior minister and grateful to call John and Sheila and their four wonderful children our dear friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Reverend Dr. John Ross is a true servant-leader who personifies faith, compassion and service to people in need. Dr. Ross came to Wayzata Community Church in 2004, after a 14-year ministry in Columbus, OH. Our Wayzata Community Church and indeed our entire Lake Minnetonka community are truly blessed by Dr. Ross' strong and principled leadership as well as his inspiring commitment to help people in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every summer since 1996, Dr. Ross has led a mission of primarily young people to Mexico where they have built over 100 homes for the poorest of the poor. As one 8th grader from our church told me, J.R. not only talks the talk, he walks the walk. He is always the first one up the ladder in the morning and the last one down from the roof in the evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Reverend Dr. John Ross is truly a man of God who lives out the Biblical command to love God, love others, and serve the least amongst us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you again, Dr. Ross. Thank you, J.R., for serving the House of Representatives today and for doing the Lord's work in our church and community every day.</paragraph>
