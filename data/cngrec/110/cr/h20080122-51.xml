  <narrative>RIGHT TO LIFE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H383]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Bachmann) is recognized for 60 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it truly is a momentous evening this evening and the entire day here on the March for Life that occurred here on our Nation's capital, and it is a privilege for me to be here as a freshman Member of Congress, hailing from the very cold State of Minnesota, to be able to be here on this floor on this momentous occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard so many eloquent speakers, led by TRENT FRANKS, a man who has a great love for people, not just a love for babies, not just a love for women. He has a love for people, and I am so grateful for the wonderful hour that he just led. We have other Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, who have come down to this Chamber because they are moved by this issue, not just for their love for babies or their love for women or love for men, but they are moved by many factors that go to increase  our Nation and the natural resources that are in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of those is Mr. Bishop who is from Utah's First District, and he would like to speak for a few moments on the floor of Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Bachmann) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks) leading this discussion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I walked past the Supreme Court this evening, remnants of the two groups were protesting this very issue, one dealing with a press conference, the other marching in chants in a way that was really more appropriate to a high school pep rally than to this particular issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I was saddened because this is one of those issues that should never be  simplified into simply chants or slogans or sound bites because this issue is one that deals with the soul of this particular country. For when we have a cavalier attitude about life at the beginning of the cycle, we tend to develop a cavalier attitude about life at the end of the cycle. And then for those areas in between, we tend to look at life not in terms of its sanctity  but in its quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that man is both perfectable and savable. But we are perfectable and savable not in the ease in which we make our lives or the material possessions which we can accumulate, but in our relationships with others and our development of our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate being able to add my voice to this particular discussion, and I appreciate the representative from Arizona, as well as the gentlewoman from Minnesota, for leading these two hours because this discussion is truly about the very heart of this country and where we go.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Bishop so much. The people from the First District of Utah have to be so proud of you, especially on the issue of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, now I would like to introduce the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) for whom I have a great deal of respect. He has a tremendous story to tell, and I yield to Mr. Garrett.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for managing this hour as Members come to the floor to speak about this extremely important topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must begin my remarks by thanking everyone who took part earlier today, all those folks who traveled down here to Washington to participate in the annual Right to Life March from all over the country, in bad bus rides and distant flight delays and bumpy car rides. I am grateful to all the marchers who came from the great State of New Jersey. Particularly, I would like to recognize the students from Pope John High School and also the kids from Veritas Christian Academy located in Sparta, as  well as some of the parishioners who came down from Our Lady of Fatima in Vernon, St. Jude's Church in Blairstown, Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Stillwater, and the folks from Lafayette Federated Church from Lafayette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't include everyone, but the list would go on and on with all of the people from the great State of New Jersey, people concerned and taking part to make sure that their voice was heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today I had the opportunity, and I would say the honor of speaking to the thousands of marchers who came out. They braved the freezing wind and the rain that was coming on as well. As I had a chance to talk to them, I told them that they, along with Members of Congress, were probably experiencing mixed emotions at the time, similar to the emotions I was experiencing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about it, on the one hand, we are immensely encouraged by what we see. We are encouraged that so many people have gathered here in Washington, DC to mark the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. We draw comfort from that fact. We are encouraged that our Nation has not forgotten that tragic death even 35 years later. We are encouraged that we can stand firm in reminding our fellow citizens that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. And most importantly  of all, is the right to life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we are encouraged that in many cases, our efforts have been rewarded. For instance, the number of abortions that are performed annually has actually dropped down back to levels not seen since the 1970s. Still, despite those signs of encouragement, our hearts are still heavy with sadness and that is because we mourn the millions of babies who have been mercilessly killed before they can even take their first single breath. And we grieve for the mothers and fathers who suffer from the  emotional pain of having to have gone through an abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We lament the fact of a continuing decline of morality, civility, and respect for human dignity and worth. For me and my constituents in New Jersey, I am particularly disheartened by a study that was released just last week that showed that our home State, the so-called Garden State, has the second highest abortion rate in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in moments like these that we must turn our gaze upward and remember the One, the One who created life is also the One who governs the universe. He commands us to "run and not be weary, to walk and not faint."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so today, we ultimately find encouragement in knowing that the battle is not over. The battle is not ours alone, and the might of right is on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will keep working to increase the number of States that have substantive parental involvement laws, thereby protecting teens from the abortion propaganda. We will continue to prohibit partial-birth abortions and fight that in other States as well. And we will show by example how to value life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, some day I pray that we will experience a January 22 free of these mixed emotions. And instead, we will be able to celebrate a renewed culture of life in this entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We elected officials come to the floor to remember the weakest among us. Yet I know we will succeed not because of who we are, but because of what Americans all across this great Nation are doing on behalf of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Garrett. Appreciate your kindness and your words of love and life for those who are our fellow Americans. Thank you, and thank the people of New Jersey for sending you to this great body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have a man that I've known for a number of years of whom I just have great admiration. His name is Mr. Todd Akin from Missouri's Second District. I yield to Mr. Akin from Missouri.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much. I'm just so thankful for your willingness to take this special hour and organize things here on the floor of the U.S. Congress, and your leadership. The people of Minnesota are blessed to have you, and I'm just very thankful to be able to be a small part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one of the things that those of us who are Members of Congress do, as you can imagine, is that we do give speeches. We talk to different groups of people, young and old, on all kinds of different issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one of the questions that I love to ask, and it's something that we should know the answer to rather quickly, and yet, most Americans don't really have the answer quite on the tips of their tongues, and that would be to ask the question, what is it that has made America such a unique and a special place for all of us to live?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you live here, sometimes you can take for granted some of the things that we enjoy every day. But America is extremely different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, there are all these people from other countries that want to come here because they believe that this is the land of opportunity; this is where your dreams can become true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from that, America has been engaged in a number of huge and colossal wars. We find ourselves as the dominant military power on the planet. And so through these different wars, did we create empires? Did we build kingdoms? The answer is, of course, no. We have named no emperors, no kings. In fact, what we did was we voted to tax our constituents to rebuild our enemies after we had defeated them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is a unique and special place. But what is it that makes America so special? Why do all these different people from different nations all come together here for the American Dream? What is it, if you were to define it, if you're looking at it like an onion and you're to say you peel off the outer layers of fireworks and apple pie and the flag and you get to the center of what makes it tick?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the words when I ask this question frequently is the word "freedom." But freedom doesn't really describe the core principle or the logic of on which basis America tips. You know, the people in Tiananmen Square, they wanted freedom. They stood up for freedom. They were willing to die for freedom. They were greased underneath the treads of tanks and they gave their lives, but they didn't get freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what is it that produces the freedom? What is it that makes America what it is? What is the formula?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if I were asked that question, I would cheat a little bit. I would go  back to our first great war when America wrote a statement of what we believe and what we stand for as a people. It is, of course, called the Declaration of Independence. It was the reason why we would dare to challenge the biggest military power in the world. And that second paragraph, the sentence, "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable rights; that among these is life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." And then the sentence goes on after "pursuit of happiness," and says, "And governments are instituted among men deriving their just power from the consent of the governed." And it goes on to say, the purpose of the government is essentially to protect these basic rights. What rights? Well, life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the engineer in me says, now, let's break this down. How does the formula that defines America work? Well, it's based on these ideas: One, that there is a God; second of all, that that God grants basic fundamental rights to all people; and lastly, the job of civil government is to protect those rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you take a look at that equation then you say, well, what does that mean? Well, first of all, we can take away from that the fact that if you take God out of the equation, you don't have any fundamental rights and the whole American system starts to come unglued.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second of all, you notice that the rights are not just Americans' rights. These are rights for all human beings. This is a powerful idea. This idea is being exported overseas, and other people are enthused and caught up in the possibility that there is a gracious, loving God that gives fundamental rights to all people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another rather straightforward conclusion would be this: that a government that does not protect the most fundamental right, the right of life, is a government that is not doing its job. It is broken. And for those of us in America over these years to have tolerated selling the lives of our unborn down the river of convenience, we have violated the most fundamental and basic logic of what America has always stood for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abortion is so un-American. It's something that people weren't paying attention on, and the Court slipped it in on them, and pretty soon people started to wake up and say, Oh, my goodness, this is horrible. And all across America, people are starting now to wake up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, because of the nature of the way that the Court usurped their power and authority and decided to take the power to themselves to create law out of thin air, we have one of the most polarizing issues that has confronted our Nation since the days of slavery. And yet, just as slavery is fundamentally un-American, so, even more so, anything that violates the most fundamental right, the right to life, is contrary to everything that Americans have stood for and fought for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some people are aware of the fact, now that we're engaged in a great war, a war against terrorists, should that surprise us? Well, think about it a little bit. What is it that terrorists believe? Terrorists believe that, hey, it's okay to blow up a few people to make a political statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what do we believe? We believe right to life is a fundamental, God-given right. We are completely on the opposite side of the page of the terrorist. The terrorist is a terrorist. And what does that mean? Well, it means he wants to compel you into doing something because you're so afraid of him. That's not very similar, is it, to what we believe; that God gives people the right to life and then the right to liberty. The right to liberty is to be able to follow your own conscience without being  terrorized by some opponent. So it is no big surprise that we fight the terrorists because they are fundamentally un-American. And yet we have terrorists in our own culture called abortionists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the good pieces of news why we are winning this war is because there are not enough heartless doctors being graduated from medical schools. There is a real shortage of abortionists. Who wants to be at the very bottom of the food chain of the medical profession? And what sort of these places do these bottom-of-the-food-chain doctors work in? Places that are really a pit. You find that along with the culture of death go all kinds of other lawbreaking, the not following good sanitary procedures,  giving abortions to women who are not actually pregnant, cheating on taxes, all these kinds of things, the misuse of anesthetic so that people die or almost die. All of these things are common practice. And all that information is available for America. And the day is coming when this public discussion will continue and America will</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm so thankful for the gentlelady for her leadership and for allowing us to have a time to engage in this public discussion, something that's not going to be done by political tricks, but by the conscience of the American public being raised to the point where they say, No more. The bad dream is over. We are going to once again honor what Americans have always stood for, the God-given right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Akin. It was a delight to be able to hear you speak, Mr. Akin. I know the people of Missouri's Second are honored that you are their Member of Congress. That was certainly a heartfelt emotion that you shared with us at the microphone, and I thank you for bringing what for many Americans is the pivotal watershed issue of our day, and I thank you for speaking so eloquently to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have next before us this evening during this hour, Mr. Jeb Hensarling from Texas' Fifth District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hensarling is a very special Member of Congress to me. He is my mentor here and is a giant among men in many ways. He's a giant in my eyes, and a giant I know for his wife, a giant for his two children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He lives the words that he speaks on a daily basis. There is no greater testimony that any man or any woman could ever have is the testimony of their life, and that, Mr. Hensarling, he knows very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so with that, I yield to Mr. Jeb Hensarling of Texas' Fifth District.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>I certainly thank the gentlelady for yielding. I thank her for those kind words. And I must admit, at 5&#xAC;6", I'm rarely referred to as a giant, but I certainly take it as a great compliment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlelady from Minnesota has done great work in this body. I'm honored to serve with her, and I hope her constituents are very proud of the work that she has done. She has been a leader on so many issues from day one, and I thank her especially on probably the most fundamental question we have in American society today, for helping lead this Special Order today on the whole question of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I need not tell you that millions of people all across America are reflecting upon that Supreme Court decision of decades ago, Roe v. Wade. Many Americans are celebrating. Many others are mourning. I am mourning. I mourn that decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm not naive. I know this question represents one of the great political fault lines in America today, and I know many of my countrymen feel quite differently than I do. But I just believe in my heart, I believe in my head, that there is no more fundamental right that we have than the right to life. And it is enshrined in our very founding documents that we were created. Our creator brought us into this world with certain unalienable rights, including the right to life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, again, Mr. Speaker, I can come to no other conclusion in my head, in my heart, than but life begins at conception. And I don't understand my countrymen who come to different conclusions. I don't hate these people. I don't disparage them. But I have great sadness about what has occurred because of their beliefs; that millions of our countrymen are not here today to take that first breath, to take that first walk, to go into that first dance recital, to hit that first baseball, to put together  that first two plus two equals four, I did it daddy. Millions and millions of our fellow countrymen will  never experience that moment because of what I believe to be a very wrongheaded and a very unconstitutional decision made many, many years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so Mr. Speaker, a battle continues in this great body as a battle continues all across our land. And it's not just a battle to change laws. It is a battle to change the hearts and minds of our countrymen. And again, it's something that I take as an article of faith. But Mr. Speaker, if there's any parent in this body who has seen that sonogram when your baby is just weeks old, to see that beating heart, to see those little fingers, to see those little toes, and know that you have this great  privilege that God Almighty has entrusted you with this gift to nurture this life, how you see that and turn your back on it is beyond me, is absolutely beyond me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, there have been others who have come here tonight who are far more eloquent than am I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I just want to, one, thank all of the fellow members of the Republican Study Committee that I have the great honor of chairing in this institution, really the conservative caucus in this House. I want to thank them for raising their voice on the single most important issue we face as a society, and that is the definition of the right to life. I want to thank them for coming to this body to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Mr. Speaker, I believe that I have a lot of blessings in life. I am not sure I will ever have a greater privilege than serving in the United States House. I enjoy coming to the floor of this institution and being able to talk about my beliefs and my vision for this great Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like some of us, we have the opportunity to occasionally meet with the President of the United States and tell the most powerful man in the world what our views are. We have opportunities to salute people who deserve recognition. We have all kinds of opportunities that give us a lot of self-satisfaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But no matter how many speeches I give on the House floor, no matter how many opportunities I have to meet with the President in the Oval Office, Mr. Speaker, those opportunities pale, absolutely pale in comparison to the opportunity that I have each week to fly home to Dallas, Texas, and have my 5-year-old daughter and my 4-year-old son run into my arms saying, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. We missed you."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's just one more reminder, Mr. Speaker, of how critical and how precious human life is, and it transcends all of the other debates that we have in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, again, I want to thank all of my fellow members of the Republican Study Committee. I want to thank the gentlelady from Minnesota adding her leadership and her eloquent voice here tonight. I wish I knew what I could say to reach out to my follow citizens and try to convince them to treasure human life and to understand how precious it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And often when we hear in the debate in this institution that we ought to do it for the least of these, truly, truly unborn life is the least of these. Let us recognize it. Let us hold it precious. And let us live up to our constitutional responsibilities, and let us live up to our responsibilities from the Creator and grant our follow citizens that precious right to life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so the battle goes on, Mr. Speaker. There has been some progress. There are fewer abortions in the land today than there was previously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I continue to be optimistic. I could not serve in this body unless I was an optimist. There is much work to be done. But I see a day, it may not be in my life, Mr. Speaker, but maybe in the life of my children, maybe in the life of my grandchildren, should I be blessed with any, that one day all Americans will somehow lock arms and lock hearts and decide that they will protect and defend that unalienable right to life; and I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Hensarling from Texas' Fifth District. He has confirmed once again to me, Mr. Speaker, that not only is he a giant among men here in this body, but he is a gentle giant, and those are the greatest of all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think I have seen a tenderness here this evening, a softness and an eloquence that he speaks, the foundational nature of the issue that we are grappling tonight. There is a sweet sorrow, if you will, regarding this subject because we are talking about something that is dealing with the foundational nature of this country and yet of all humanity, and that is life and what we will do with life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I jotted down just a few words before I came up to manage this hour. And I wrote down that every generation, Mr. Speaker, seems to grapple with an issue that transcends all others. That issue for 31 years has been whether government will protect from destruction life, innocent human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our American landscape has changed so dramatically over these last 31 years. I was in high school when the Roe v. Wade decision came down. I hate to admit I was so ignorant when I was a junior in high school, I didn't even know what abortion meant. I didn't even know what it was. What innocence that time was in the early seventies here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that time, Mr. Speaker, we have lost 50 million fellow Americans, and now we've lost the children, some of whom those 50 million would have borne. There are 50 million women whose bodies were violated by the horrific violence that we call here in this chamber abortion. There are 50 million men who have lost out on the tremendous privilege and joy of fatherhood, and our Nation today is poorer because we're missing, Mr. Speaker, 50 million fellow Americans, so sadly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An inordinate number of these 50 million Americans are children of color. We needed those children of color in our Nation. We needed those African American babies, those Latino babies, those Asian babies. We need them, Mr. Speaker, in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we mourn together the loss of these priceless treasures that would have woven a beautiful tapestry of humanity even here in our midst. Yes, we mourn with a great sadness, but we also rejoice, and we also take great joy in the fact that today, even now, we're making a down payment because today is a new day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a new day for a future of change, and it's my hope and my prayer that it is today, Mr. Speaker, that the words that are spoken on this floor would captivate the attention of young women and young men across our Nation, young people who may have had the chance to turn this show this evening on television, who would choose to respect their bodies and would choose to respect their sexuality and choose to respect their fertility because fertility is a gift. It's not a given. It's a gift.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ask those people who can't have children. Ask women with love who would love to bear a child but can't, young people who will choose to be givers in this Nation, givers to one another in love, givers to themselves, givers to our Nation and givers to the next generation of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, earlier, I had the great privilege of being in my home State of Minnesota. I went up to the steps of our State capitol. Thousands of Minnesotans had gathered. You think it's cold in Washington, DC? There is nothing like a March For Life rally in the State of Minnesota. It was sub-zero. I wasn't wearing boots. I had a wool overcoat on, and in a moment, my feet were tingling, freezing cold. There were thousands that were there that had braved sub-zero freezing temperatures, holding signs,  from cities across the State of Minnesota because they wanted to be there to choose life, Mr. Speaker, and march for the greatest gift that any of us have ever had, the gift of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take these few minutes right now to thank the Americans and the people across the globe who have chosen to adopt children. There is no such thing in this country as an unwanted child. There is no such thing. There is a line a mile long of men and women who would give anything tonight to adopt a child. Yes, even the less than a perfect child there's a mile long group of people who would say me, let me, just like Mother Theresa of India who said give them to me and I will take these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you to those who have chosen to give life, and whether you kept that child or blessed another family with a child, thank you for choosing life tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank parents who have chosen to be foster parents, who have taken children in less than ideal situations, or parents that couldn't cope  with a child who was difficult. I thank the foster parents who have opened your hearts, opened your arms, opened your homes, who've inconvenienced yourselves, but yet, you have chosen a better way, to give life in a different sort of way to children in foster homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the women who have chosen life and the parents who have encouraged their young daughters or their sons to be supportive of women in a situation where they didn't know if they would choose life or if they would choose to take life. I thank the parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's easy when your child is suffering with an unplanned pregnancy to say it's okay, I'll support you, I'll take you to that abortion clinic, I will pay for that abortion. But they don't always recognize that there is a price that that young woman will pay for the rest of her life in her emotion because her arms will be forever empty, and she'll know that there is a baby that could have been hers and yet was not, or a young man who knows he could have been a father to that baby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parents, think again. Taking the easy way isn't always the easy way, Mr. Speaker, and for boyfriends who just heard the news that their girlfriend is pregnant, oh, my gosh, of course I will pay for the abortion you say, let's do that. You don't need this; I don't need this. We've got a whole life in front of us. Who needs this? We can do this. I will borrow the money from my parents, the boyfriend might say, Mr. Speaker, or yet he might say I'll drop you if you don't have this abortion. I'll  leave you. I'll walk out on you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's another way. There's another choice. There's a choice called life, and it may be inconvenient and it may be embarrassing and it may be expensive, and yes, it will change your life and there may be pain, but there will be joy when you hear that first cry, when you hold that hand that literally covers your finger. And when you look in those eyes and you stroke that silky hair, there is nothing like that baby that you will see, and it will change your life as a young man. It will change  your life as a young woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That baby has the power to change America. Every baby has the power to change this country. They are America's greatest natural resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my parents, David and Jean, who gave me life. I thank my husband who stood by me with our five babies and who stood by me when we lost a baby. I thank you for standing by me when we didn't know if we could go on anymore, and I thank you for stepping up to the plate, for being willing to bring 23 foster children into our home so we could offer an alternative for those children and hopefully give them a down payment on a future and on a hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These remarks that we gave here tonight are not about condemning anyone. Who could? Who could? I couldn't condemn anyone. Who could? But it's about lifting up people. We're here to lift up people. These remarks tonight weren't given to judge anyone. Who could? We're here to heal and offer a healing alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why recently I introduced a bill, and it's a bipartisan bill. Democrats are on this bill. Republicans are on this bill. This is not partisan. This is about life, and this is about humanity and choosing the best that are among us, and in the Positive Alternatives Act, we just say something very simply. It says that today there are tax dollars that go to Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortion in the United States. Tax dollars go to Planned Parenthood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are not tax dollars that go to life care centers in this country, and we want to change that. We want to level the playing field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And we want to give a positive alternative all across this great country so that there is a chance for men and women to say, let me think about this. Maybe I don't want to choose death. Maybe I want to choose something else. Maybe there's someone out there who can help me through a difficult time, who could help me with my medical needs, who could help me to get a job, who could help me get some education, who could help me get clothes on my back, who could help me if I want to keep this baby,  who could help me if I want to give this baby to a family who maybe doesn't have a baby. It's just common decency to allow for an alternative that leads to life and not lead to guilt and to death, and perhaps remorse that even a lifetime could never erase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are such a great country, Mr. Speaker. I know you feel that way, I know you do. And we're a blessed country. Let's choose life. Let's choose the better way. It's the American way.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in this hour to speak for the millions of innocent voices that have been silenced due to the passage of Roe v. Wade on this day, 35 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the passage of Roe v. Wade, the National Right to Life estimates that nearly. 50 million lives have been lost. This number is staggering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do the deaths of 50 million children, say about the state of our Nation? It says that the Declaration of Independence is no longer absolute, as its "unalienable" right to life only applies when it is convenient. It says that Congress can make a Federal crime out of roosters crossing State lines, but when a defenseless child is taken across state lines to have an abortion, it is merely a "right"--a choice being exercised. It says that seven unelected Supreme Court justices ignored the  separation of powers, and appointed themselves as a superior legislature in order to decide the abortion issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what is the good news? The good news is that citizens who believe that the Constitution protects life in all its seasons have worked to educate the public about abortion and the biological development of the unborn child, as well as to provide support and options for women when they need it the most. As a result, abortion numbers continue to drop from a high of over 1.6 million in 1990 to 1.2 million in 2005--proving that when given the right options and the whole truth about abortion, many  women will choose life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, even as the pro-life movement continues to have an impact all over the United States, science has opened other doors that threaten the sanctity of life in the United States. Mass production of cloned embryos to be destroyed in research promotes the same principle as abortion--that human life only matters when it is chosen to matter. We must continue to be vigilant in protecting human life at its creation--whether in the womb or in the lab.</paragraph>
