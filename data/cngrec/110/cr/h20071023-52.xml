    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Young Women's Christian Association, or YWCA of Northwest Georgia for their efforts to eliminate the epidemic of domestic violence that transcends all ethnic, racial, age, gender and socioeconomic boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The YWCA of Northwest Georgia, under the leadership of Executive Director Holly Comer, has made it their mission to bring the issue of domestic violence to the forefront and to educate Georgians on ways to prevent abuse and violence within the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the YWCA of Northwest Georgia is not only the sole domestic violence shelter located in the heart of my 11th District in Cobb County, but has also taken a leadership role in combating domestic violence throughout the State of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was, in fact, the YWCA of Northwest Georgia that open the very first shelter for victims of domestic violence in the State of Georgia. Through the ministry of Cobb Shelter, the YWCA has worked together with victims, families, social service providers, and criminal justice officials to stop the spread of domestic violence</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing YWCA of Northwest Georgia and similar groups throughout the country for their contributions toward making our Nation's homes safer places for our children and families.</paragraph>
