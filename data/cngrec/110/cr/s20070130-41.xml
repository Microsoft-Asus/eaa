    <paragraph>Mr. President, I said at a meeting with the press earlier today how much I appreciate the Republicans supporting cloture on this minimum wage bill. I hope we are going to have a good bipartisan vote on this bill. There is no question in my mind we will. We have done ethics reform. We are going to do the minimum wage and then move on to something else. I hope we can work on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as you know, we have debate on Iraq coming up when we finish this bill. We are trying to figure out exactly what we are going to be debating because it is a moving target on both sides. We hope to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want the record to reflect that I think we are making good progress, and we are doing some legislating. That is very important to the Senate and the country.</paragraph>
