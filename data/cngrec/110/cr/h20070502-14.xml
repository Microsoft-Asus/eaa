    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday Congress sent the President an emergency supplemental bill that provides our soldiers and our veterans everything the President asked for and more. It was a bill supported by the American people, this Congress and military experts who believe it is time to change the course of the war in Iraq. The President's response? A veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's action last night shows not only his stubbornness and his inability to work with others, it also demonstrates that he simply refuses to change the status quo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President refuses to give our troops, this Congress, or the American people any timelines as to when this war will end or under what conditions he would finally bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President says that things are getting better in Iraq, but that's simply not true. Last month was  one of the deadliest months for American troops in Iraq. One hundred four soldiers were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for a new course. It's time for the President to sit down and work with this Congress so we can finally produce the change that will end this war.</paragraph>
