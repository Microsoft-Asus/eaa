    <paragraph>Today I rise to congratulate the West Virginia University Mountaineers for their amazing win in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four short weeks ago, West Virginia University captured its third consecutive bowl victory and cemented their third consecutive top 10 finish. They defeated the University of Oklahoma Sooners 48-28. College football fans throughout the Nation were treated to an exceptional college football game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to West Virginia head coach Bill Stewart, athletic director Ed Pastilong, West Virginia University president Mike Garrison, and West Virginia's student athletes for winning the Fiesta Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my congratulations to the Oklahoma Sooners and their student athletes for a great season. Oklahoma won the Big 12 championship game and had an 11-2 regular season record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The WVU Mountaineers were pregame underdogs against No. 3 ranked Oklahoma, whose defense had previously allowed only 92 yards a game. The exceptional play of Mountaineer quarterback Pat White, the Fiesta Bowl offensive MVP, helped the Mountaineers produce 525 yards of total offense. Reed Williams, the Mountaineer linebacker and Fiesta Bowl defensive MVP, helped his teammates hold the Sooners to only six points in the first half and a total of 28 points for the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again I congratulate the West Virginia Mountaineers for their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 938, commending the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team for exemplifying the pride, determination, and spirit of the Mountain State and overcoming adversity with skill, commitment, and teamwork to win the 2008 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the years, the Mountaineer football team has been a source of great pride for West Virginians, and this past year proved no different. On January 2, 2008, the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team won the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, defeating the University of Oklahoma Sooners by a score of 48-28 in Glendale, Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After what could have been a team demoralizing loss of head coach Rich Rodriguez, then assistant coach Bill Stewart stepped up to demonstrate true leadership and coaching skill by instilling confidence in his team and leading them to victory, earning the admiration and gratitude of his fellow West Virginians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mountaineer quarterback Pat White gave a dazzling running and passing performance that inspired his teammates, delighted WVU fans, frustrated his opponents, and earned him offensive MVP honors. Defensive honors went to Mountaineer linebacker and native West Virginian Reed Williams, who led his team in an outstanding defensive performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the conclusion of an impressive 11-2 season, the Mountaineers finished among the top 10 in college football rankings for a third consecutive year, and with their new head coach Bill Stewart, brought great honor to themselves, their university, and the State of West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>High marks should also be given to athletic director Ed Pastilong, who, over his 19-year career, has instilled the athletic department of West Virginia University with the highest standards of ethics and performance. We should also recognize WVU president Mike Garrison for his leadership. WVU is committed to changing lives and providing opportunities to all through education, building knowledge through research, and serving the people of West Virginia through economic development and health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to head coach Bill Stewart and all the hardworking players, the fans, and to West Virginia University. I'm happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Mollohan in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. And I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a colleague who represents Morgantown, West Virginia, with us, Mr. Mollohan, and I know there is no greater fan of the West Virginia Mountaineers than he. I am sure he is justifiably proud; so I will yield him such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank both my colleagues for their very kind, gracious remarks about West Virginia University and the game that we speak of today, particularly the Fiesta Bowl game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="938">H. Res. 938</bill>, congratulating the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team for its recent outstanding Fiesta Bowl victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mountaineers' regular season closed with an unexpected and a bit demoralizing loss that ended the team's bid for a national championship. As a further complication, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, the team began preparation for the Fiesta Bowl without its head coach, who left suddenly for another opportunity. WVU consequently was branded the underdog for the Fiesta Bowl appearance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But these young men and the able interim head coach, who is now the permanent head coach, who stepped into the void were steady, they were confident, and they were prepared to pursue a game plan unaffected by the swirling controversies and the many media pundits who predicted defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, seeing that team demonstrate grit, skill, and determination,  as described by my colleagues, to silence its critics, while overcoming challenges, reminds us of the potential for accomplishment that resides in us all. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="938">H. Res. 938</bill>, as it offers a "well done" to a team that set a high bar for accomplishment, focus, and determination.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to my colleague, the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I would like to thank my colleague from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) for offering this resolution and including me as one of the cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are very prideful Mountaineers. As we have heard, our West Virginia Mountaineers football team is something that everyone in the State takes great pride. The Tostitos Fiesta Bowl win was not only an athletic win, but it was a morale-lifting win for everybody in the State of West Virginia. The Oklahoma Sooners are a powerful team, and I congratulate them for their effort. But when mind and body of a Mountaineer gets together, there's hardly any stopping us. I think that is what we found at  the game. The team always tries to embody the spirit of the Mountain State, and it is a shining light for the people of West Virginia. The fans, the coaches, the university, the president, the athletic director, and I have to mention the pride of West Virginia, our Mountaineers marching band, are something that I know took our teammates into a very difficult athletic and emotional situation at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate the MVPs, Pat White and Reed Williams. Reed Williams is a native West Virginian. He's from Moorefield, West Virginia. He was valedictorian of his high school class. He is the true embodiment of a student athlete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a saying in West Virginia that we like to say whenever we have a great victory, and that is, as we say in West Virginia, "It's a great day to be a Mountaineer." It certainly was on the day that West Virginia won the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Arizona.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just to tie this whole thing together, we have just celebrated the LSU Tigers' national championship and West Virginia's championship in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. As a Member from western Pennsylvania, I would like to take a brief moment and remind my colleagues of the role the University of Pittsburgh played in this whole scenario, because were it not for the improbable upset that the University of Pittsburgh was able to pull off on the last game of the regular season,  we may have been doing these in a little bit different order than we were today. So I congratulate West Virginia and LSU. But I did want to put in that plug as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="938">H. Res. 938</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
