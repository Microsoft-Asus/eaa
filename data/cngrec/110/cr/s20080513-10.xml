  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak to the amendment which we will vote on shortly. It relates to the cost of gasoline. I can't think of another issue that has been in the forefront across America for a longer period than the cost of gasoline. It goes beyond that, obviously, to diesel fuel and jet fuel costs. We see it every day. You drive down the road, and you watch prices going up at the gas station. People ask Senators and Congressmen: You are supposed to be the bigwigs here.  You are supposed to be so influential. Why haven't you done something; the gas prices are killing us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they are. Whether it is a family member commuting back and forth to work in downstate Illinois, trying to get to the State capitol, whether it is a an over-the-road trucker spending almost $1,000 to fill up his rig with diesel fuel, whether it is the CEO of an airline who has seen the worst first-quarter losses in the history of that airline because of the rise in the cost of jet fuel, it is hitting everybody. I talked to a chiropractor over the weekend. She told me her practice was dying  because people didn't want to drive 20 miles for her services. They said: We will see you every other week instead of every week. As you see, it is starting to reach into every single area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what response do we have from the Republican side? The response is predictable and ineffective. Here is what they say: You know what we ought to do. We ought to start drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and we ought to start drilling for oil off the coasts of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OK. How much oil is there?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh, there is a lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the scheme of things, it is not a lot. All of the oil reserves within the control of the United States of America, all of them combined come to 3 percent of the world's total oil reserves. Each year, our Nation--a powerful, large economy--consumes 25 percent of all the oil produced in the world. We cannot drill our way out of this issue. We cannot drill our way to lower prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is something they fail to mention: If we gave approval today--which I think would be a bad idea--to the Republican approach, it would be years before the oil would start trickling in, meaning years of high prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what can we do here and now? Two things: First, we can start dealing with the price gouging of consumers. Prices are going up dramatically at historically high rates. They are not justified by the barrel-of-oil prices. The spread between the cost of a barrel of oil and the cost of refined product keeps growing larger and larger, and the oil companies that are refining the crude oil keep making more and more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Price gouging is going on. That is the first issue. Is there any mention of consumer price gouging in the Republican approach? Not one word. In the Democratic approach, we believe price gouging should be part of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, accountability of the oil companies. These oil companies, over the last 7 years when George Bush from oil country has been our President, have seen their profits quadruple--four  times the profits they were making just a few years ago. The cost of oil and diesel fuel has gone up 2 1/2  times; the oil company profits, quadrupled. These companies are not only making more money than oil companies have ever made, they are making more money than  any business in the history of America. That is a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a windfall profits tax. We say there is a limit to how much these oil companies should be making as profits when it causes so much damage to American families and businesses and farmers and truckers and the economy. We have a windfall profits tax. The Republican approach: nothing--nothing to address the oil company profits. That is the reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, came to the floor a few minutes ago and told us what is going on with the Republican strategy. So far in this session of Congress--we have 2-year sessions of Congress--the Republicans have initiated 70 filibusters. Today, they will hit 71. You might say: So what. What does that mean? In the history of the Senate--over 200 years--the maximum number of filibusters in a 2-year period of time was 57. The Republicans have broken that record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is a filibuster? A filibuster is a way to delay, slow down, avoid, try to turn the page to another issue. Over and over and over again--70 times--the Republicans have now set a record for obstruction in stopping progress in the Senate, whether it is on issues of energy, whether it is on issues of health care, helping our schools, dealing with the war in Iraq--over and over and over again, Republican filibusters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will have a vote. We are going to have a vote in a short period of time--at 12:15, maybe earlier; I am not sure. But in the course of that vote, we will have a choice on whether we at least will make one small step forward when it comes to dealing with gasoline prices. We cannot justify, in the current situation, continuing to take oil off the market where the Federal Government buys it and stores it. It is called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Currently, it is at about 97 percent  of capacity. We are buying the most expensive crude oil in the history of the world, and storing it, taking it off the market, further putting an increase on gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will offer an alternative to the Republican approach which will say that we will suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It might pass. Fifty-one Democratic Senators, incidentally, wrote a letter to the President on March 11 asking the President to suspend the filling of the Petroleum Reserve because gasoline prices were out of control. The President refused. Now we have to pass a law to force the President to do something about these gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think suspending shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the most sensible way for us to bring these prices down. I hope we can get the cooperation of the Republicans, beyond that, to deal with the price gouging of consumers and accountability for oil companies and not face another Republican filibuster when it comes to that important issue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just have so much to talk about. I wanted to follow my text I had prepared, but having heard the Democratic Senator discuss this issue, I have to tell the American people, one, their energy policy, if they are talking about today, is a policy that has to do with the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The leader of that policy is the distinguished Senator Dorgan. He has led that cause, and he is going to win. But literally that cannot be an energy  policy. It is 70,000 barrels a day that we are not going to buy and put in the reserve--70,000--and that is for the rest of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we use 21 million barrels of oil a day. So let's face up to it. If you do not think 1 million barrels a day from the Alaskan arctic wilderness--which would be American, and we could get that coming to America for maybe 50 years--if that is not better than 70,000 barrels for 7 or 8 months to not put in the Reserve but leave in the world market--I will leave that to anybody who is listening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Price gouging is in their portfolio again. They talk about it. Last year, we gave authority to the Federal Trade Commission. They have not yet found any gouging. We hope they do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I would like to go on and talk about what we are trying to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 4737. It is now known as the Reid amendment, but it is actually Senator Dorgan's amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier this year, I gave a detailed speech on the Senate floor about the perils of our Nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. At that time, I noted the Nation was ignoring policies that would increase our energy supply while the stranglehold of foreign oil was tightening. I spoke bluntly and warned of dark days ahead for our Nation's economy and foreign policy if we continued to send our money abroad to buy oil from unstable and hostile regions around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stated that at the current price of oil, we are at a pace to send nearly a half trillion dollars overseas annually to purchase oil--a half trillion. When the driving season ends, and the price at the pump subsides a bit, naturally the volume of constituent letters and phone calls will decrease a bit. When the cameras fade and the focus of the day begins to turn elsewhere, we should stop and reflect on the debate we are having today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, a growing and gathering storm is swirling around this Nation. It is threatening our economic strength, our national security, and our place in the world. That storm comes in the form of dependence upon foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Congress passed a strong energy bill, built on advancing cellulosic ethanol and strengthening our fuel efficiency standards. We made great steps in setting up policies that will reduce our gasoline consumption. However, I said at the time, and say again today, last year's legislation had a glaring weakness, which is highlighted today. Last year's bill failed to include measures for domestic energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we tried to open the Virginia Outer Continental Shelf to natural gas leasing, the other side blocked that. When we tried to improve our Nation's refining capacity, the other side blocked that. And when we tried to advance domestic coal-derived fuels--a very major way for America to diminish its dependence on foreign oil--the other side blocked that. On conservation and efficiency and the  pursuit of clean energy, this Chamber is in wide bipartisan agreement. But on producing more American oil and gas to reduce the price of gasoline at the pump, it will become clear from today's debate and vote that the vast majority on the other side opposes action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When today's vote is over, regardless of the outcome, I will continue to return to the Senate floor and speak on this important issue of our growing dependence on foreign oil. I will continue to speak out against policies that increase the cost of energy, when the American people so clearly want us to provide relief from high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have listened intently to the increased debate over the past few weeks about our energy challenges. I have heard some on the other side plead with OPEC nations to increase production by one-quarter of the amount we provide for in America with this amendment--one-quarter the amount. I have heard ANWR opponents from a decade ago repeat their claim from a decade ago that ANWR oil will take a decade to produce. I never heard this argument when we were supporting increasing vehicle fuel economy  standards that we know will take a decade to come to fruition. We passed a bill that everybody takes credit for. It will take 10 years for it to have an impact. Yet we praise ourselves for producing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, all of this would be assuming the price of oil did not increase over $100 per barrel during the time that ANWR was being blocked. If President Clinton had not vetoed ANWR over 12 years ago, we would have this oil from Alaska on the market today. I have also heard my colleagues argue that 70,000 barrels of oil per day would make a significant difference in the price of oil--that is the SPR bill--while denying access to over 1 million barrels of oil per day from ANWR alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to act, and what the other side has offered at this critical moment is talk of energy independence supported by more Government investigations and empty threats to OPEC combined with pleas for more OPEC production. If that were not enough, we are faced with the prospects of a windfall profits tax like the one that passed in April by the Chavez administration in Venezuela. We tried to implement such a tax in the 1980s. It did not work then, and it will not work now. We cannot produce  more energy by taxing oil companies or taxing anyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Congressional Research Service, the imposition of a windfall profits tax could have "several adverse economic effects." And such a tax could be expected to "reduce domestic oil production and increase the level of oil imports." The architect of this tax during the Carter administration recently called the windfall profits tax "a terrible idea today."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we consider real solutions to our national problem. On May 1, I introduced the American Energy Production Act of 2008. Obviously, if we had Democratic support and help we could make it even better, but we had to do this with Republicans, to lay before the American people a fact: that there are ways to produce more American oil and natural gas without doing any real harm to the American environment. I am pleased to have 21 cosponsors on that bill, and I am pleased Senator McConnell  has offered this legislation as an amendment to the bill currently before us. Unfortunately, the other side has not allowed us to consider this proposal to address record-high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking of filibusters, on our bill they have insisted there be 60 votes. That is the equivalent of a filibuster. So you can chalk one up for us. They are filibustering the only Energy bill we have seen in a while that would produce energy for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bipartisan amendment on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I have already indicated to you that I do, and it needs no further explanation. I am confident, if enacted, the American Energy Production Act--the one we are talking about--will strengthen our Nation's security for decades to come. In this legislation, we open 2,000 of the 19 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And I defy anyone with common sense to seriously contend that 2,000 acres out of 2 million  will harm that wilderness. It can be done with a small footprint, and everyone knows it. We have just chosen sides, regardless of the real facts. Therefore, I assume the Democrats will defeat it again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taken together, these policies enable the production of 24 billion barrels of American oil, which would increase our domestic production by nearly 40 percent over the next three decades. Opening ANWR alone would create thousands of American jobs, provide $3 billion in revenues in the next 10 years to the Federal Treasury, and bring on line over 1 million barrels of oil per day. This amendment also spurs the commercialization of coal-derived fuels and oil shale resources. Advancement of these  policies will be spoken of in more detail by other Senators but, clearly, they are things to look at. The American people ought to know about them. They are sources--huge sources--of energy that can be made in America by Americans for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With emerging economies around the world increasing their thirst for oil, we face a new energy challenge in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world demand for oil continues to grow. America's production of oil has fallen to its lowest levels in 60 years. That is because we haven't done anything new or significant to add to what we have produced for years. If we do not start producing more of our own energy resources, we will continue to rely on unstable foreign oil and continue to pay a high price. That is what is at stake with today's vote. We probably will not win, but we feel very comfortable giving the other side an opportunity  to vote no again for the production of oil and gas that is American, by Americans, for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to be voting on some extremely important energy issues, and I have expressed my views on those before. I wished to take an opportunity to talk about another matter which we will be voting on later this morning, early this afternoon, and then will be the subject matter that will be before the Senate for the next few days. It is an extremely important matter. It deals with our national security; primarily homeland security. It deals with the challenges that our first responders are  faced with. I am talking about our police officers, our firefighters, and our first responders. They are the ones who are on the cutting edge of our domestic national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are seeing massive reorganizations of our various institutions that have dealt with homeland security. We have seen additional resources focused on homeland security. The legislation Senator Gregg and I offer will strengthen our national security by including those individuals who are on the frontline into the decisionmaking about what is helpful and useful in terms of the security of our communities, small cities, and large cities all across this Nation. It will give them a voice  in making judgments and decisions so those decisions and judgments are not only going to be made by policymakers and bureaucrats but by men and women who are on the ground. The legislation is called our Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. It is bipartisan in nature, and it can make an extraordinary difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had the opportunity last evening to go over the essential elements of the legislation, sort of the dos and the don'ts. There are those who have misconstrued this legislation and have misrepresented the legislation. We have seen that sort of technique around here in the Senate when Members differ with the legislation. They distort it or misrepresent it and then differ with it. It is an old technique that is used around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will have the chance this afternoon and tomorrow--and this is a notice we will welcome--Senator Gregg and I--will welcome amendments. This legislation has in one form or another been before the Senate previously. It had extraordinary bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. I believe 98 Republicans supported the legislation, which is an indication of the breadth of support it has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will look forward--and we are going to urge our colleagues to help us move this legislation, which is of such great importance and consequence to the security of our people--we will ask them to help us move it forward. This week is Police Week. Police Week goes back actually to 1962, when it was named by President Kennedy. Since that time, police officers have gathered to pay tribute to those members of the force who have lost their lives over the period of the last year. It is a very impressive  ceremony for those who have not gone to it. I have on a number of  different occasions. But we take time this week to pay tribute to those first responders, and we have welcomed their very strong support for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will affect police officers and firefighters. Some 300,000 police officers in 24 States will benefit from this bill and are in strong support of the legislation. We also see support with regards to the firefighters: 134,000 firefighters in 24 different States will benefit. We have worked very closely with them. These are the various groups that support this legislation: The International Association of Firefighters; Fraternal Order of Police; the National Association of Police  Organizations; the International Union of Police Associations; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as I say, we will be ready to deal with this right after the caucuses that we will have during the noon hour. This legislation will hopefully be before the Senate. We are hopeful now. This is a vote on the motion to proceed. We ought to at least have that opportunity to debate this issue, and we are hopeful we will receive the support from both sides of the aisle so we can move forward and debate the issue.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Texas is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bill we are going to vote on starting at 11 o'clock. We have an amendment filed by the distinguished Republican leader. The Senator from New Mexico is the prime sponsor of this amendment. I commend Senator Domenici for his continuing leadership in the energy arena.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of 2007, when control of Congress changed hands, the price of gasoline was $2.33 a gallon. Today, it is $3.73 a gallon. That is a 60-percent increase, and it is going in that direction even further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason for the record-high price is simple economics. The global demand for energy has soared, especially in fast-rising countries such as China and India. Meanwhile, the supply of energy has remained largely stagnant. This is a simple, classic economic principle: The law of supply and demand. When the demand goes up and the supply stays the same, the price goes up. Knowing that, the best way for Congress to reduce the price of energy is to increase the supply of energy. We need more American  oil, more American natural gas, more American clean coal, and we need more American nuclear power. That is why I joined the ranking member of the Energy Committee to introduce the bill today that would do exactly that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Two weeks ago, I wrote a letter to the President, signed by 13 Republican Senators. I noticed it was announced by the majority leader that 51 Senators on his side had signed the same type of letter in March. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record with the signatures of the 13 Senators.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, April 29, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We write today to request that the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) immediately halt deposits of domestic crude oil into the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). As we enter the busiest driving season of the year. the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil hovers around a record $120.</narrative>
  <narrative>The SPR was established in 1975 to provide a supply of crude oil during times of severe supply disruptions. Today. The SPR contains more than 701 million barrels of oil, exceeding our International Energy Program commitments to maintain at least 90 days of oil stocks in reserve.</narrative>
  <narrative>High energy prices are having a ripple effect throughout the U.S. economy and exacerbating recessionary pressures. The Energy Information Agency reports that supplies and inventories of crude oil and refined products are above 2007 inventories while our demand for gasoline is down. Yet, the price of crude oil has skyrocketed 100% from last year's levels which were just above $63 a barrel in April 2007. Despite these economic realities, the DoE recently solicited contracts to exchange up to 13  million barrels of royalty oil from Federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico for deposits in the SPR.</narrative>
  <narrative>Some analysts blame geopolitical instability and disruption in production for the rapid price increases; however, these factors alone do not explain the extraordinary increase in oil prices compared to previous years, when these same challenges were present. Temporarily halting deposits to the reserve can provide some relief because the increased supply of oil available for refinement will send the right signal to all markets that the U.S. Government will take measures necessary to address exorbitant  crude oil prices that negatively affect the global economy. We believe, in light of the dramatic increase in oil prices, a temporary halt to deposits into the SPR should be considered until the economy stabilizes.</narrative>
  <narrative>I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to hearing back from you.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what we are asking the President to do is temporarily halt deposits of oil into the SPR. Today, the SPR holds 118 days--almost 4 months--of reserve for an emergency in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to stop now to ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the Dorgan amendment No. 4737.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Because what the Dorgan amendment does--and what is also included in our bill--is to ask for a temporary halt on any more oil going into the SPR. Halting the daily deposits of 76,000 barrels a day into the SPR would allow 3 million additional gallons of gasoline to be available on the market. If we halted the 13 million barrels of oil the Department of Energy has sought contracts for to go into SPR, it would be more than the total February 2008 imports from Libya, Syria, Kuwait,  United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Azerbaijan, and China combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment offered today would halt additional contributions to the SPR for 180 days and ensure that these resources could be utilized immediately in the marketplace. In addition, we would open the grassy plains of ANWR, which is unavailable for drilling today. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there could be as much as 10 billion barrels of oil in ANWR. This would be almost enough oil to replace what we import from Saudi Arabia every day. What would be drilled in ANWR isn't near a forest  or a stream. It is a grassy plain. It is 2,000 acres, about the size of National Airport, in an area of ANWR which is the size of the State of South Carolina. So drilling in this grassy plain would be environmentally safe, and it would make America much more independent, much more reliant on ourselves and our resources for our energy needs--a place we need to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another area, the Outer Continental Shelf, could contain as much as 115 billion barrels of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 3 more minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>There could be 115 billion barrels of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf. That is more than Venezuela's proven reserves of 80 billion barrels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need more refinement capacity. This amendment encourages refinement expansion to alleviate supply concerns with refined petroleum, which is gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment we are voting on today would not do much to bring down the demand because, in fact, we can't control what China and India are demanding in oil and natural gas resources, but it can affect supply. That is what Congress has turned a blind eye to doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All they talk about is a windfall profits tax on oil companies. We tried that once before and what happened? Jobs went overseas. We had to import more from overseas, so we became more dependent on foreign sources and we lost jobs for our country. The price would not go down. It would just come from foreign sources instead of ourselves. So let's don't talk about things that will not help; let's talk about supply, which we can help by working together to increase our utilization of our own natural  resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year we will spend about $500 billion to import oil. All those dollars  could stay in America, creating good jobs in America and making us self-reliant. If there is anything America stands for, it is the spirit of self-reliance, of knowing that if we are running into a crisis, if our economy is down, that we would be dependent on ourselves because we have the resources to meet this demand. We have the resources. Now we need the willpower. We need  the good old American spirit to say we can prevail. We can reduce prices. We can help the American family get over the hump. We can do something by relying on ourselves. That is what the amendment we are voting on will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the American people will look at these votes. Do they want political rhetoric, windfall profits taxes that send jobs overseas or do they want real solutions short term, by not putting any oil in SPR right now and putting it on the market to start bringing that price down and to let those who are hedging on commodities know America is going to act. The best we can do for America to show those hedgers we are going to act is to say we are going to take the long-term steps. We are going to  drill in our own areas that we control. We are going to put jobs in America. We are going to help the States get their royalties if they want to drill offshore. We are going to stand up and say: This is America, and we will take care of ourselves with our own natural resources. That is the vote today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am not going to speak so much about what divides us. Today I wish to talk about what would unify us with respect to the two energy plans. We are going to vote on an amendment that is a bill I offered back in February of this year that would stop putting oil underground. Some say that doesn't mean very much in terms of energy prices or that it would not accomplish a lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had testimony before the Senate Energy Committee by economists and an energy expert. Dr. Verleger testified that what's coming from the Gulf of Mexico is sweet light crude, the most valuable subset of oil. Despite the fact that it is a small percentage of the oil usage, it could have as much as a 10-percent impact on the price of sweet light crude. I don't think we should underestimate the significance of this proposal. At a time when oil prices are bouncing up in record highs, with oil prices  at $120, $124, and $126 a barrel, we have speculators playing their fiddle. The oil prices dance up into the stratosphere; the economy is damaged; consumers get injured; and industries are going belly up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question at this time is, what unites us here? I will tell you one thing we can agree on. There are at least 80 Senators who have expressed themselves, including all three Presidential candidates. They have said let's stop putting oil underground. Is it a reasonable thing to do to set oil aside underground? We have something called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Let me show you what it is. This is what it looks like. Instead of oil going into the pipeline so you can convert gasoline to  your automobile, it is going underground. This is what the SPR looks like. Here is where the SPR is being stored--at Bryan Mound, Big Hill, West Hackberry, and Bayou Choctaw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SPR is 97 percent full. The question is this: With oil at $126 a barrel and gasoline around $4 a gallon or more, and with the American consumer being burned at the stake, why should its Government be carrying the wood? Why should we be putting oil underground at a time of record-high prices? Who thinks it is smart to go out into the marketplace and take oil that is that valuable and stick it underground when it is having an impact of upward pressure on oil prices? That makes no sense at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, all three Presidential candidates have said we ought to stop at this time. Eighty Senators have agreed with this decision. Somehow, the President and Vice President are insistent that we continue to fill the SPR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look, there are a lot of other things happening. Number 1, we need more production. I was one of four Senators who introduced the legislation, with Senator Domenici, that led to opening Lease Sale 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. That is additional production, and I am proud that became law. It should have been broader, but it got narrowed through the legislative process. I have a bill in to expand production in the Gulf of Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we need additional production, conservation, efficiency, and renewables. We need all those things. We have made progress in some of them. Last year, we finally passed reformed CAFE. We increased CAFE standards 10 miles per gallon in 10 years. That is a historic achievement after 32 long years in this Congress. We set us on a course toward renewables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are short-term, intermediate, and long-term solutions. John Maynard Keynes says that in the long run we are all dead. How about the short term? How about today? I know where there is 70,000 barrels of oil, including sweet light crude, that could go into the gas pumps and into cars and put downward pressure on gas prices. I know how we can take action and so do my colleagues. At least we can agree on that piece of legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another point. There is unbelievable speculation in the commodities market. It is interesting. Let me give you a couple of charts that show this. The senior vice president of ExxonMobil said last month:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of oil should be about $50 or $55 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Cazalot, the CEO of Marathon, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A man who testified before the Energy Committee, Mr. Gheit, a senior energy analyst with Oppenheimer, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is absolutely no shortage of oil, and I am absolutely convinced that oil prices should not be a dime above $55 a barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It is open 24/7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, we have speculators, hedge funds, and investment banks that have never been in the futures market before and are in neck deep. They are driving up prices that have very little to do with the fundamentals of supply and demand. Should we ignore that and say that is OK?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think I have consumed 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Should we say that is OK, let's talk about other subjects? I don't think so. If you want to purchase stock on margin, you have to put up 50 percent of the money. If you want to control $100,000 worth of oil, the subject of such speculation, all you need now is a margin requirement between $5,000 and $7,000. It seems to me that the margin requirement ought to be increased to the point of wringing speculators out of the system. We need a futures market for legitimate hedging and for  liquidity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are times when speculative bubbles develop. In this case, the bubble driving up the price of oil and gasoline at the pumps is damaging our economy. A lot of industries are suffering, including truckers and the airlines. It is hurting a lot of American families, and we can do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a couple different plans. Let's take the one common part of both plans, which is the amendment I offered as a bill in February, and pass that today because that will make a difference. Is it a giant step? Not at all. Is it a step that is finally at long last in the right direction? It is. So instead of getting the worst, let's try to get the best of both sides and say this we agree on, this we can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that at the end of today, at least this Congress will have said to the President and Vice President: Stop doing what you are doing. The last thing in the world we ought to do is put upward pressure on gas and oil prices. We ought to put downward pressure on that, and we can do that today with one single vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend, Senator Dorgan, I have changed my mind about the SPR bill. I think he knows that. People wonder about changing your mind. A lot of people change their mind. I changed mine because of the real price of oil and because I do believe we are not going to harm our strategic reserve by  this one event. I wish to make the record clear. America needs the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We must have it, and  we should not grow accustomed to thinking the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is going to solve our energy supply problem. Senator Dorgan has never said that. But it would not. I will answer some of the remaining questions when I wrap up.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last weekend, when I traveled around Wyoming, it was clear that high energy prices were on everyone's mind. It is a trend I have noticed each and every summer for the past several years. Each year, our constituents ask us to do something to address energy prices. While we talk and talk about what we are doing, rarely do we take any meaningful action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a little different this year because Americans are seeing record prices at the pump. Those voices saying "get to work on this problem" are more numerous. They are louder. Will the anguished calls for help make it through the thick and, thus far, shut doors of Congress? Americans are caught in a tight spot. Some are asking: How can I put food on the table when I cannot afford the gas it takes me to get to work? On top of that, the food is more expensive because of the fuel it takes to  produce and ship it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one in this Chamber has all the answers. No, but we can do something. We can act. We can help. The question for me and my colleagues in the Senate is, will we? We have the opportunity to do so today. We have the opportunity to vote for an amendment that provides short-term relief and, at the same time, helps address the long-term issues that got us into this situation. I am a cosponsor of the McConnell-Domenici amendment, known as the American Energy Production Act of 2008, because it is a  responsible way to address the need to produce more domestic energy and to reduce energy prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy situation we are in has been a long time in the making, and we are not going to fix it overnight. We don't have enough domestic energy to meet our Nation's energy demands, but the American Energy Production Act would help change that. It opens an important sliver of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, to environmentally conscious leasing and allows for more production from the Outer Continental Shelf, with consent of the State. Doing so will help the United States produce more  of its own energy. Instead of sitting at the trough of foreign oil barons with our hands out begging, Americans will produce more American energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later today, I expect to see support for the Dorgan amendment to suspend filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If you are worried about roughly 70,000 barrels a day staying off the market for this reserve fill, then you should be outraged that 1 million barrels a day from ANWR is kept off the market because it was vetoed by President Clinton more than 10 years ago. That is a million barrels we would not need to purchase from South American dictators, or a million barrels from countries  who are friendly to those who wish to destroy the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What will Americans say about this vote 10 years from now? Will they say: Better late than never, because we passed the American Energy Production Act, or will they say: You just didn't get it and now look at us suffer for it. The American Energy Production Act recognizes also that coal is our Nation's most abundant energy source. It recognizes American ingenuity. It recognizes that coal has been turned into diesel fuel for half a century, and it encourages the building of coal-to-diesel facilities  in the United States. The United States is the "Saudi Arabia of coal." Wyoming is the leading coal producer in the United States. It makes sense that we use America's most abundant energy source at a time when we all agree we are too dependent upon foreign energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also includes a number of important provisions that will help Wyoming and the Nation. The amendment repeals the mineral royalty theft that was included in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus appropriations bill. It allows development of oil shale to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the idea of developing more alternative energy, the use of wind energy, and the development of better solar energy technologies. As my constituents can tell you, Wyoming is an especially good State for wind, and we have high solar potential as well. While we need to develop these technologies for the long term, we need all the energy we can get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need more domestically produced oil, more wind energy, more domestic natural gas, more solar energy, more nuclear energy, and we definitely will need more clean coal energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's energy policy is haphazard, broken, and it threatens to break our country. We need to make meaningful changes to that policy, and voting in favor of the American Energy Production Act is the first step in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will recognize the need to take this step and support the McConnell-Domenici amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me take up to 5 minutes at this point. If the Chair will advise me when that 5 minutes has been used, I would appreciate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have two votes coming up related to energy. The first is on the McConnell amendment, which is a compilation of various provisions that relate to energy but, I argue, do not hold out much promise for affecting the price of oil or gas. Following that, we have the vote on the proposal that is put forward by the majority leader, Senator Reid, with regard to suspending the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the balance of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be voting against the first amendment and voting for the second amendment. I hope my colleagues will do so as well. Let me give the reasons why I think we should vote against the Republican leader's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Republican leader's amendment doesn't do anything to deal with the issue of speculation in oil markets. We have had testimony repeatedly before our Senate Energy Committee that speculation in these markets is a significant factor contributing to the $126-per-barrel price of oil we are seeing today. So if someone is concerned--as all of us are--about energy, consumers, and the burden that is being place upon them, then dampening speculation in these markets should be high on our list  of work to be done. It is not in the Republican leader's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the amendment he proposes also doesn't do anything with regard to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, anything with our fiscal policies. Yesterday, I went into a discussion about how that is contributing to the increase in the price of oil. I think most economists would agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second reason I would oppose the Republican leader's amendment is that it misses the boat on how to promote more supply. The argument being used is the assumption within the amendment that the way to promote more supply is we need to open more areas for drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And particularly we need to open the east coast of the United States for drilling offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, we need to open the west coast offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, and we need to open a portion of ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I say, I think it misses the key issue in that we are opening additional areas for drilling at a pretty rapid rate in the onshore areas of the United States where oil and gas production occurs and in the offshore areas. But additional leases by themselves are not going to make a difference to consumers either in the near term or the medium term. What we need to be focused on is how we can promote more diligent development. Nearly three-quarters of what we have leased domestically onshore is  not now being produced. A little over three-quarters of what we have leased offshore is not being produced, and that is what we should be concentrating on--how do we build in incentives for actual production in areas we have, in fact, leased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, with respect to future lease sales, the Republican leader's amendment leaves out the most promising  area, and that is the area in the gulf coast, particularly the area we have still not opened in the original lease sale 181 area of the gulf coast. This is something we clearly should be addressing as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I say, the second vote is going to be on the proposal to suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. A version of that is in the Republican leader's amendment, as well as being proposed by Senator Reid. I hope we will get a very strong bipartisan vote for that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do think it is prudent to turn down this compilation of various energy-related provisions that has been put forward by the Republican leader with the claim that it is going to bring down the price of gas. It simply will not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the McConnell-Domenici amendment because it does what we need to do to address this real crisis in our country--crippling energy prices, rising energy prices that hit the pocketbook of every Louisiana family I represent and every American family, that is causing grave concern about our economic future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am afraid what we heard from the distinguished Senator from New Mexico just now is more of the same excuses we have heard for a couple of years now: why we can't do this, can't do that, and can't act in general. What has that inaction, that paralysis, those excuses all led to? I will tell you what it has led to. It has led to soaring energy prices. In January 2007, when this Democratic Congress took office, the average price of a gallon of gas was $2.33 at the pump. Today, it is $3.72--a 60-percent  increase. That is what those excuses, that is what that inaction has led to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to do a number of things across the board on the demand side and on the supply side. This Domenici-McConnell amendment includes all of those. Does it include every one of them? No. No single proposal is ever going to include every good idea out there that we probably need to act on, but it includes a lot on which we need to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to focus on one part of the amendment in particular of which I am very supportive, and that is opening more of our Outer Continental Shelf to exploration and production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe one of the most important things in energy policy that we have done since the short time I have been in the Senate is to open new parts of the Gulf of Mexico with revenue sharing. This provision in the Domenici-McConnell amendment will expand on that precedent. It would say we can open areas of the Atlantic and the Pacific, but with two very important caveats, both of which are great policy. First of all, the host State, the State off which the activity would occur, has to want the  activity, has to agree to it. The Governor has to say: Yes, we want this activity off our waters. And secondly, that host State in return would get significant revenue sharing, exactly the same revenue sharing we passed a few years ago, 37.5 percent to go to the host State to meet its environmental</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is much the McConnell-Domenici amendment does that is needed as well, but I wanted to highlight that point because it is so absolutely crucial and important. It builds on good policy we set a few years ago. It expands on that precedent, and I believe expanding on that precedent can significantly increase our domestic energy resources in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do we need to do other things? Absolutely. Do we need to act on the demand side further? Absolutely. This isn't brain surgery. Economics 101 tells us that price has to do with two lines on a graph: the demand line and the supply line. We need to mitigate, bring down demand, and we need to increase supply. I am for any reasonable policy that does those two things. On the demand side, conservation, greater efficiency, new sources and forms of energy--absolutely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to agree with Senator Dorgan and vote for his amendment regarding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Like Senator Domenici, I have changed my mind on that issue because the increases in price at the pump have gotten so dramatic and so outrageous. So that can mitigate demand increases as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as we make all of those efforts on the demand side--and we need to do more--we cannot constantly ignore the supply side, particularly the domestic supply side. That is exactly what this Congress has done for the last 2 years. Mr. President, $2.33 price at the pump then; $3.72 price at the pump today. Let's act, and let's act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. It embodies a policy change that I have advocated for many months. In January, I wrote to the Secretary of Energy and urged the administration to stop filling the SPR while oil prices are so high. The Reid amendment would suspend acquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, until the end of the year or until the price of a barrel of oil goes below $75.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SPR is an emergency stockpile and an essential safeguard against major disruptions in global oil markets. However, the SPR already contains nearly 700 million barrels of oil, 97 percent of its current storage capacity. This is more than sufficient to meet a crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Nation faces record-high energy prices affecting almost every aspect of daily life. The prices of gasoline, home heating oil, and diesel are creating tremendous hardships for American families, truckers, and small businesses. High energy prices are a major cause of the economic downturn. Last week, crude oil was trading at over $120 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration's decision to fill the SPR when oil prices are so high defies common sense. In 2005, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and I joined forces on a bipartisan amendment directing the Department of Energy to better manage the Reserve by requiring the Department to avoid purchases when prices are high so as not to drive up prices further by taking oil off the market. I don't believe the Department of Energy is abiding by this law. If it were, the Department would not  be making purchases while prices are so high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It simply does not make sense for the Department of Energy to be purchasing oil for the Reserve at a time when oil prices exceed $120 per barrel. The Federal Government is taking oil off the market and thus driving up prices at a time when consumers are struggling to pay their fuel bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the administration stopped purchasing oil for the SPR, the Energy Information Administration has estimated that the impact on gas prices would be between 4 and 5 cents a gallon. Other experts believe it is considerably higher. At a hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in December, one energy expert, Philip Verleger, said, "DOE's actions added between 5 and 20 percent to the price of oil." It is a bad deal for taxpayers for the Department of Energy to be purchasing  oil when prices are so high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other short-term steps we must take to address the energy crisis--for example, regulating energy futures markets and repealing tax breaks for major oil companies--but suspending filling the SPR is a key step that I hope we approve tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the long term, our challenge to address energy prices is, of course, to reduce our reliance on imported oil. We need to pursue the goal of energy independence just as fervently as the Nation embraced President Kennedy's goal in 1961 of putting a man on the Moon. Energy independence, stable energy costs, and environmental stewardship are goals that are within our reach. I urge my colleagues to get us started on the effort by supporting this proposal to suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I wish to say that my good friend, my fellow Senator from New Mexico spoke about speculation in this oil market. There may be some. We heard testimony there may be. So everybody knows, there is nothing before the Senate that the Democrats propose regarding speculation. They just have a one-shot bill, and it is pretty good, but it is not an energy policy. Probably most of us are going to vote for it. That is what Senator Dorgan proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated, I changed my mind. If people are wondering about that, I was reading about economic history, and I read where John Maynard Keynes, the great economist, was asked: Why did you change your mind? He said: When the facts change, I change my mind. That is what happened here with reference to SPR. The facts changed, and I changed my mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good Senator from New Mexico, my colleague, also said we have a big problem with the weakening of the dollar. I hope he doesn't intend to imply by that, when we find we can strengthen the dollar, then we will solve the energy problem. I don't know that we know how to do that one any quicker than we do the energy crisis. I don't think that would accomplish anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot going on in the gulf, so we said let's let those continue. That is what the Domenici bill says. But we say the rest of the offshore around America--and incidentally, there is probably more than any of us know in offshore America. We probably would send such a big signal to the world if we decided to move on that. That alone would have a positive impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill before the Senate does a lot in a number of areas that have not been talked about very much. It would cause the world to take another look and to say: America is serious, they are really going to do something about their energy problems.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, one thing has been accomplished by the debate leading up to this morning's vote; that is, Congress finally--finally--has acknowledged the existence of the law of supply and demand. If we look at these two votes we are going to have this morning, first is the McConnell-Domenici amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, which would produce, if implemented, potentially up to 3 million additional barrels of oil a day from the United States of America--3 million--making  us less dependent on imported oil from some of our Nation's enemies, countries such as Iran and Venezuela that are part of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alternatively, our friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed--and I will vote for it--a temporary suspension of putting oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But how much does that represent? It represents 70,000 barrels of oil that would not be put in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and would be available on the open market as an additional supply of oil, which is then available to be refined into gasoline. I suspect it will have some modest impact on the price of gasoline at  the pump, maybe 3 to 5 cents a gallon. But if we think 70,000 barrels of additional oil into the open market will be beneficial in terms of bringing down the price of gasoline, how much more beneficial would it be to have 3 million additional barrels of oil produced from our country out on the open market available for refining into gasoline to help bring down the price of gas at the pump?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that our colleagues have recognized the importance of the law of supply and demand, something Congress has turned a blind eye to for lo these many years as we put so much of America's natural resources out of bounds when it comes to developing those resources, and, of course, we know what the consequences of that have been, with $3.71 average price for gasoline in America today and the price of oil on the spot market bouncing up around $125 a barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know whether this amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, could produce ultimately 3 million new barrels of American oil each day. I don't know whether it will get the requisite 60 votes. But if it does not, when gasoline is $3.71 a gallon and oil is $125 a barrel, I wonder if the same vote, if we have it again when gasoline is $4 a gallon and oil is $150 a barrel or when gasoline is $4.50 a gallon and the price of oil is even higher, at what point the Congress, the Senate is  going to listen to the American people and say: We need some help; we need some relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that Congress has acknowledged the importance of additional supply in terms of bringing down the price at the pump, ultimately it is my hope our colleagues will vote, at least 60 of us, for the Domenici-McConnell amendment. I think the American consumers would be the beneficiary of that. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me conclude with a couple of thoughts. First of all, my colleague from New Mexico described the issues of speculation a bit. We do, in fact, in our larger proposal that we announced last week, have a provision dealing with speculation. And it is important that we do that because speculation is part of what is driving these prices. I showed comments from executives of some of the largest oil companies in this country that said there is no justification for the current  price given supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said the price of oil should not be much above $50, $60, $70 a barrel. So what is happening? Well, let me come to that in a moment. Let me say, first of all, my hope is that today, here on the floor of the Senate, we will decide to do some good things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, how do you do good things? You try to find areas of common interest and legislate moving ahead where you can. That is what Senator Reid has suggested in the underlying amendment that we will vote on dealing with stopping and halting the putting of oil underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is something I introduced in the Senate back in February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as I said before, when the American consumer is being burned at the stake by high gas prices, its Government ought not be carrying the wood. I mean, it is that simple. We can do something about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about 70,000 barrels a day, 70,000 barrels every single day of sweet light crude that we are taking off the market. Dr. Philip Verleger, an economist and energy analyst, testified before the Energy Committee on the effects of such a move. He said although it is only three-tenths of a percent of usage, because it is sweet light crude, the most valuable subset of oil, it could have up to as much as a 10-percent effect on the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it seems to me what we do is, do what the Republicans and Democrats have now generally come together to say we should do, and say to the President: Look, you cannot put 70,000 barrels of oil underground every day. You cannot do that. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 percent filled, 97 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, oil is $120, $126 a barrel; gas is going to $4 a gallon. Let me describe the situation we all understand that we face on this planet of ours. We stick straws in the planet and suck oil out. We suck out 85 million barrels every day. We are required to use one-fourth of that in this little spot of geography on the planet called the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that again. We take 85 million barrels a day, and we need one-fourth of it to be used in the United States. Now, 60 percent of that which we use comes from outside of our country. That holds us hostage to others. And 70 percent of the oil we use in this country is used to fuel vehicles. So vehicles are an important part of this issue. I am proud to say this Congress, with this majority and some minority help, has passed for the first time in 32 years an increase of 10 miles per gallon  in the next 10 years of CAFE standards. This will lead to better automobile efficiency and better gas mileage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made some progress in other areas. We opened production in Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico where there are substantial reserves. We made progress in the biofuels ethanol standards and renewable fuels standards. We have made some progress on all of those issues, but we have people coming to the floor today to say: Well, gas is $4 a gallon. Let's open ANWR. That means we get oil in 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As John Maynard Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead. What can we do in the short term? At least today, on Tuesday, we can at least do what we both believe--that is, what the minority and majority believe is appropriate--and that is stop putting oil underground and put some downward pressure on gas prices and oil prices. Give the consumer an opportunity to see some decent prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This speculation in the futures market is speculation that is driving up prices. We want to do something about that as well. But at least today we have one common theme; we can increase supply by 70,000 barrels a day of sweet light crude. Instead of it going into the supply that comes through the pump into the cars, which puts downward pressure on gasoline, it is now going underground, underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It makes no sense at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am saying: Let's stop doing bad things and let's start doing good things. We can start by taking the first step in doing that today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Let me make one additional point, if I can. It does not relate specifically to this amendment, but this issue of the free market. You have an OPEC cartel behind closed doors. You have oil companies that are bigger through mergers. You have a futures market that is now rife with speculation. There is no free market. So the American people deserve, it seems to me, a Congress that will stand up and take some steps to put some downward pressure on gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a step we can take today. It is a step that is not a giant step, but it is a step in the right direction that will put downward pressure on gas prices. It will help this country. My hope is, following this vote, we will see that both parties can contribute to something when we agree on it. I think this will be a good day to put downward pressure on gas prices.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>On behalf of the amendment, I wish to say whoever is interested in what is going on today should know that Democrats speak of doing other things to bring the price down, but the only thing we are really doing is the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota on SPR. We all agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a temporary 7-month deferral of purchases. Clearly, if it does anything, it will be extremely temporary. All of the other things that are spoken about, none of them are in this bill, whether it has to do with fraud, speculation, or whatever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On our side we have at least said: Let's start coal to liquid, a great American resource. Let's start offshore around America. Let's start on ANWR. Let's start moving on oil shale. Let's accelerate battery research, which will move us toward automobiles that can plug in, which will be a big American boon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there are lots of pluses. There is a lot of rhetoric. And there is one amendment that the Democrats offer that we agree upon. I believe those people interested in production should vote for the Domenici amendment and tell the American people the truth: We can produce in America and put pressure on the world markets and reduce the price of oil.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me take the 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a piece of legislation I introduced in February of this year. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 percent filled. We have oil and gas prices going through the roof in this country. We are putting 70,000 barrels of oil underground every day. It is a subset of the most valuable kind of oil: Sweet light crude, coming from the Gulf of Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard testimony before the Senate Energy Committee that even though it is a small part of our oil usage, this subset of oil--the 70,000 barrels a day put underground--could have an impact of up to 10 percent of the price of oil. I am not suggesting this does everything, but it is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, when the American consumer is being burned at the stake by energy prices, the Government ought not be carrying the wood. Sticking oil underground is wrong at this point in time, and this amendment simply says: Stop it. Halt it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the amendment to stop deliveries of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crude oil prices reached a record high recently of $126 per barrel, leading to record highs in the price of other fuels produced from crude oil, including gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. With prices going through the roof, it is the wrong time for the Department of Energy, DOE, to take millions of barrels of high-priced oil off the market and put it into the SPR. Instead of reducing supplies by taking oil off the market and increasing the price of oil, the DOE should be looking  for ways to decrease the price of oil. One step is a moratorium on filling the SPR until oil prices are lower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the DOE is contributing to the current price spike by filling the SPR regardless of the cost of crude oil or the petroleum products that are refined from crude oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three major problems with the DOE's insistence on putting high-priced oil into the SPR. First, by placing oil into the SPR the DOE is reducing the supply of crude oil and putting upward pressure on the price of oil. Second, by placing very expensive crude oil into the SPR, the DOE is significantly increasing the cost of the SPR program to the taxpayers. Third, the DOE's approach runs counter to the direction provided by the Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which requires the  DOE to fill in the SPR in a manner that minimizes the impact upon prices and the costs to the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DOE is currently taking about 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil off the market and putting it into the SPR. For the first half of 2008, this will total to about 10 million barrels of crude oil. This is reducing our inventories of crude oil and refined products, such as gasoline, just at a time when our refineries need to be running at maximum to make gasoline for the spring and summer driving seasons. The DOE also has asked for bids for another 6-month program to fill the SPR, beginning  later this year. If the DOE is permitted to continue with this program, it will take millions more barrels of oil off the market beginning sometime later this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the basic economic principle of supply and demand, reducing the supply of crude oil available to U.S. refineries will increase the price of oil and gasoline. Even the DOE agrees with this basic economic principle. Mr. Guy Caruso, the head of the DOE's Energy Information Administration, testified to the Congress earlier this year that an SPR fill of 100,000 barrels per day would add about $2 per barrel to the price of oil. Last December, Dr. Philip Verleger testified that the SPR fill was  adding about $10 per barrel to the price of crude oil. Economists may disagree on the amount of the increase, but now there should be no doubt that the DOE is increasing the price of oil by filling the SPR at this time. The DOE acknowledges this. The DOE should be working to lower oil prices, not helping to boost them to record highs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DOE says the amount of oil it is putting into the SPR is insignificant compared to total global supply. This is the wrong comparison. The amount of oil DOE is putting into the SPR represents a significant marginal increase in the demand for oil. When supply and demand are closely balanced, a marginal increase in demand can have a very large impact on price. This is precisely the situation we are in today. Supply and demand are very closely balanced. Adding a demand of millions of barrels of oil  over a period of several months can have a very significant impact on the amount of oil on the market or in inventories. In a tight market, taking millions of barrels off the market can indeed have a major impact upon oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the DOE fills the SPR it does not have to actually purchase any crude oil. Instead, the DOE takes oil that is paid to the Federal Government as royalties for oil produced by private oil companies on offshore oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico and trades it back to private oil companies for oil that is then placed into the SPR. Thus, the DOE's program to acquire oil for the SPR does not require any Federal appropriations. But that doesn't mean the program doesn't cost the taxpayers any money.  In fact, the opposite is true--the SPR program costs the taxpayers a lot of money. The higher the price of oil, the more it costs the taxpayers. This is because instead of selling the royalty oil on the open market at whatever the market price of oil is, recently as much as $126 a barrel, the DOE is taking</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A moratorium on filling the SPR until prices are lower would save the taxpayers money. If the DOE were to acquire SPR oil at $75 per barrel instead of $125 per barrel, it would save $50 per barrel. For 10 million barrels, that would add up to $500 million. Delaying the filling of the SPR would not affect or harm our national security or our energy security. The SPR is currently about 97 percent full, with  slightly more than 700 million barrels of oil.  This amount of oil is large enough to ensure that we are prepared for any contingencies that the SPR is designed to cover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, over the entire life of the SPR the largest withdrawal of oil from the SPR has been for about 30 million barrels. The amount of oil in the SPR today already is far more than has ever been needed to cover market disruptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DOE's policy to fill the SPR at the same rate regardless of the effect on oil prices or taxpayer costs runs counter to the intent of Congress in section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which directs DOE to consider and minimize the effects on oil prices and costs to the taxpayers when acquiring oil for the SPR. I sponsored the amendment, along with Senator Collins, that became this provision in the law. We did not intend this to simply be a formality, whereby in every case  DOE would simply</paragraph>
    <paragraph>conclude that the effect on price was insignificant. Yet that seems to be how DOE is applying this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, completed a detailed investigation of the SPR fill program. The subcommittee's 2003 report is titled "U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve: Recent Policy Has Increased Costs to Consumers But Not Overall U.S. Energy Security." It can be found on the Subcommittee's Web site. The investigation found that in 2002 the Bush administration changed the DOE's policy on how it would fill the SPR, and that this change in policy increased  the price of oil but not our overall energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the Bush administration changed the DOE's policy on filling the SPR, the DOE sought to put more crude oil into the SPR when supplies were plentiful and prices low and less crude oil into the SPR when supplies were scarce and prices high. The DOE also would allow oil companies to defer deliveries for up to a year when supplies were tight, provided that the oil companies would deposit more oil into the SPR at the end of the deferral period. Through this deferral policy, the DOE was able  to obtain additional SPR oil for no additional cost to the taxpayer. This policy made good sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my subcommittee's report documented, in 2002 the White House directed DOE to change its policy. Instead of allowing the DOE to continue with its sensible policy, the White House directed the DOE to fill the SPR at the same rate, regardless of market conditions. The new policy also prohibited the DOE from accepting any deferrals, regardless of market conditions. The career DOE staff vigorously protested the changes ordered by the White House. The career staff pointed out that filling the SPR  in times of tight supplies and high prices would push prices up and that not allowing any deferrals would cost the taxpayers more money. The career staff also argued that the old policy followed good business judgment and the new policy would be difficult to defend under sound business principles. These memos are included as exhibits to the subcommittee's 2003 report. The DOE career staff's recommendations were rejected, however, and the current policy was adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the issuance of this report, in early 2003, I asked the Department of Energy to suspend its filling of the SPR until prices had abated and supplies were more plentiful. The DOE refused to change course and continued the SPR fill without regard to market supplies or prices. In response, I offered a bipartisan amendment, with Senator Collins, to the Interior appropriations bill--which provides funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program--to require the DOE to minimize  the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing oil into the SPR. The Senate unanimously adopted our amendment, but it was dropped from the conference report due to the Bush administration's continued opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next spring, I offered another bipartisan amendment, also with Senator Collins, to the budget resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the administration should postpone deliveries into the SPR and use the savings from the postponement to increase funding for national security programs. The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 52 to 43. That fall, we attempted to attach a similar amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill that would have postponed the SPR  fill and used the savings for homeland security programs, but the amendment was defeated by a procedural vote, even though the majority of Senators voted in favor of the amendment, 48 to 47.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next year, the Senate passed the Levin-Collins amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the DOE to consider price impacts and minimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing oil into the SPR. The Levin-Collins amendment was agreed to by the conferees and signed into law as section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, unfortunately, passage of this provision has had no effect upon the DOE's actions. The DOE continues to fill the SPR regardless of the market effects of buying oil, thereby taking oil off the market and reducing supply by placing it into the SPR. In the past year, no matter what the price of oil or market conditions, the DOE has consistently said that the market effects are negligible and claimed that there is no reason to delay filling the SPR, effectively ignoring the section 301 requirements  of the Energy Policy Act. The result is that we have the current contradiction of DOE depositing oil into the SPR at the same time the President is urging OPEC to put more oil on to the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is not the time to be filling the SPR. When oil prices are at record highs, we should be looking for ways to increase oil supplies and reduce prices. The Department of Energy is doing just the opposite. It is taking oil off the market and increasing prices, doing so at great costs to taxpayers and despite enacted law requiring that they do otherwise. There is now a strong bipartisan consensus to put a halt to the administration's misguided SPR policy. I urge my colleagues to vote for this  amendment to postpone the filling of the SPR until oil prices have fallen to lower levels.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want the Republicans to know I have changed my mind over the past 3 or 4 weeks, and it is simply because the price of oil is now up to $125 a barrel--perhaps in real dollars $110. I think for 7 months to stop filling SPR could have a chance of reducing the price by a small amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no bones about it now, this is no big energy policy. This is one little thing we can do, and I think we ought to go ahead and do it. I know there are some who take the fact that we need a big reserve very seriously, and they think we ought to continue to fill it even more than we are, and I respect those views. But with reference to this amendment, by Senator DORGAN, I think we ought to support it and at least do one positive thing. It was in our bill, incidentally, as one of a number  of positive things we would do, including Alaska, which is complained so much about. It would produce a million barrels permanently, more or less. This is 70,000 barrels one time--so we understand.</paragraph>

I have been told by my distinguished friend, Senator Domenici, that there is going to be an objection on the other side. I think it is really unfortunate. That is one reason people are a little concerned about our conduct here. We just passed something by almost 100 votes, and someone now is objecting to taking this up  as a bill.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week, the Senate had a fruitful debate on, and today the Senate will vote on passage of the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act. This bill extends the flood insurance program for 5 years, while making commonsense reforms so that flood insurance remains available to millions of Americans who live in flood-prone areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though many people think of floods as confined to coastal areas, I want to let my colleagues know that in the last year, there have been flood claims in all 50 States. Every State has at-risk areas, and in the absence of private insurance, the National Flood Insurance Program is the only way for home and business owners to ensure they can rebuild after the waters recede.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering makes some tough choices, as I talked about last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to assure the continuation and availability of flood insurance, this bill essentially restarts the flood program. It forgives the $17 billion of program debt so that all policyholders will not face steep premium increases. All 5.5 million policyholders would have to double their premium payments just to pay the interest on this debt. To make a dent in the principal, premiums would have to increase many times over. Increases of this magnitude would drive untold numbers of people to drop  flood insurance--at a time when we ought to be encouraging more people to purchase this critical coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to avoid these steep premium increases, the bill forgives the debt. In addition, it reforms the premium structure so rates are actuarially based. Yes, this reform will result in some policyholders paying more for flood coverage, but the premium increases are much less than they would be if this bill were not to pass. If we do nothing, FEMA's $17 billion debt hangs over the entire program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we accepted 11 amendments. We were able to accommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle--specifically Senators Menendez, Coburn, McCaskill, DeMint, Dole, Thune, Durbin, and Landrieu. Their amendments help to strengthen this bill and the flood insurance program. These amendments include provisions to ensure that FEMA does outreach when mapping changes occur, to make policy exclusions clear to home and business owners, and to strengthen the flood insurance advocate  created in the committee-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Senator Shelby and his staff for working so closely with us on this bipartisan bill. I also want to thank the majority and minority leaders for agreeing to move to this bill, and for supporting our efforts last week to accommodate debate and amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially thank the staff who have worked on this legislation. In particular I want to thank Lula Davis, Tim Mitchell, Tricia Engle, and Mark Wetjen on Leader Reid's staff, and I want to thank Rohit Kumar and Dave Schiappa on minority leader McConnell's staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Shelby's staff have been invaluable, and I want to recognize the work of Bill Duhnke, Mark Oesterle, Mark Calabria and Jim Johnson. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of my own staff, including Shawn Maher, Jennifer Fogel-Bublick, and Sarah Kline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said, this is a strong bill that ensures flood insurance will be available for many years to come. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that families can rebuild their homes and their lives after a flood.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After Hurricane Katrina, I had a chance to meet some of the survivors who were displaced by the storm and ended up in Illinois. Many had lost their homes, their jobs, their communities, everything. Nearly 3 years later, some are still picking up the pieces of a former life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't stop every disaster from happening. But we can be prepared, so what happened after Katrina never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Katrina taught us the importance of being prepared. We need to understand the risks of disaster, prepare homes  and communities to withstand disaster, and make sure that once disaster strikes, communities can get back on their feet as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national flood insurance program is one of the best ways we do this. It allows people who live near rivers or other flood-prone areas to insure themselves at an affordable rate against the risk of a flood. If the worst happens, it covers some of the costs of recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is critically important to Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois has the largest inland system of rivers, lakes, and streams in the Nation. Floods are 98 percent of Illinois' declared disasters. That is why only three other States have more communities participating in the flood insurance program than Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today renews the flood insurance program, which expires this September, and strengthens the program in several important ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It puts the program on sound financial footing. It forgives the $17 billion debt from Katrina and other storm-related losses, a debt the program could never repay. But the bill also requires FEMA to establish a reserve fund so we are in better shape to cover future losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It encourages more people to buy flood insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides more funding to update old flood maps, so communities know where the hazards are and can plan accordingly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am pleased that this legislation also contains an amendment I offered to make sure that the costs of flood insurance are shared fairly between Illinois and Missouri down near St. Louis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Floods are among the most common and costly natural disasters. Passing this bill will strengthen our ability to prepare for what we know is coming and to return to our lives as soon as possible once the flood waters recede. This bill helps ensure that when the next Katrina-like disaster hits, we won't see a Katrina-like aftermath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senators Dodd and Shelby for their hard work on this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition to express my views about the pending energy amendment aimed at increasing domestic oil and gas production. In recognizing that this is a symbolic vote aimed at stimulating debate on the Nation's energy situation, I am voting for this amendment today because I want to affirm the principle of taking decisive action on the Nation's energy issues. I do, however, have reservations about some of the provisions contained within this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I fully support measures contained in the package which would further the development of alternative fuels for the transportation sector and for electric-powered vehicles; set goals for the use of coal-derived fuels; suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; and streamline the permitting process for new oil refineries, I believe further debate is necessary on some other provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, when these energy issues are revisited, there should be further discussion of opening additional areas of the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling as well as further discussion on the moratorium on commercial leasing of oil shale in the Western United States. I understand the need to develop our domestic resources due to growing global demand for oil, but we must ensure these steps are taken with the utmost environmental sensitivity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will vote for the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act because it would help place the National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, back on solid financial footing. It is not a perfect bill, but I hope that some of my concerns can be addressed in the House Senate conference process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress established the NFIP in 1968, flood insurance was not available at an affordable price, resulting in frequent and costly Federal disaster aid payments. The new program created a method to share the risk of flood losses through a national insurance program and required preventive and protective measures to mitigate the risk. Currently, Michigan has over 27,000 flood insurance policies, and since the program's inception, over $42.6 million in flood claims have been paid to Michigan  policyholders. This bipartisan reform bill extends this important program through 2013, and enhances the long-term viability of the program, helping to provide self-sustaining, critical insurance coverage for millions of home and business owners throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, the flood insurance program has covered most claims through the premiums it has collected. However, recent losses from the 2004 floods and 2005 catastrophic hurricanes have left the program over $17 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury. This reform bill takes the painful but necessary step of forgiving that debt. At the same time, this legislation makes changes to the program to help ensure its continued long-term financial solvency. The aim is to ensure that each time a hurricane,  deluge or other natural disaster hits, flood claims can be paid without relying on taxpayer funds from across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of measures in this bill aimed at restoring the program's financial stability. These include requiring certain at-risk properties to pay phased-in actuarial rates, extending the Severe Repetitive Loss Mitigation program to mitigate losses on the most at-risk properties, and requiring the program to build up reserves. These and other new requirements reflect difficult choices because they are not without cost to property owners, many of whom are already stretched by staggering  gas and grocery prices, falling home values and a dismal economy. This bill attempts to recognize that reality by maintaining some subsidized rates for Federal flood insurance where buildings were built before the existence of a federal flood map, and phasing-in new actuarial rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also expands and encourages the purchase of flood insurance for properties in areas with flood risks. Property owners in a 500-year floodplain would be notified about the risks they face, but would not be required to purchase flood insurance. To better define areas of flood risk, the bill would require FEMA to establish an ongoing map modernization program using the most accurate data and consistent standards for mapping. These changes will help generate the necessary premium income  for the program while striving to maintain affordability for homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also expands and encourages the purchase of flood insurance for properties in areas located behind levees, dams, and other man-made structures, recognizing that these structures could be breached. While recent history has shown us that levees can and do fail and that no properties are entirely risk-free, I am concerned that imposing this mandatory requirement in a uniform fashion may not accurately reflect the risks these communities face. Michigan has 2,500 dams and numerous levees  scattered across the State; properties behind these structures would be required to purchase federal flood insurance regardless of the risks they face. We need to better understand the implications of requiring mandatory insurance for all of these areas before we impose a blanket requirement on all of them. For this reason, I voted in support of an amendment offered</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I recognize that making the NFIP more financially sound requires making some tough decisions, I believe some of the choices reflected in this bill lead to unfair results. For example, I am concerned about what will happen to property owners currently not mapped into a floodplain should a new map require them to purchase flood insurance. Currently, these property owners would receive subsidized policies, because the buildings were built before the flood risk was known. However, this bill  removes the subsidized rate for properties that get remapped into a floodplain. While the bill provides a 2-year phase-in for these unsubsidized rates, it is not fair to demand higher rates from those who, through no fault of their own, had no idea they had exposure to flood damage, especially at a time when so many families are struggling to meet their monthly expenses. This inequity is one that I hope can be addressed when this bill is conferenced with the House version passed last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also inequities in existing approaches of FEMA's mapping of flood risk which need to be corrected in conference. For instance, revised flood  maps are being developed by FEMA for the city of Grand Rapids in such a way that does not incorporate the existing flood protection provided by the city's recently completed $12.4 million floodwall improvement project. The revised flood maps would put over 6,000 additional properties into the 100-year  floodplain, at a cost of over $6 million per year. This is an area that has not flooded at that level since 1905, and that occurred when the city did not have structural flood protection. FEMA's action appears arbitrary, ignores the participation of its State partner, and would likely decrease property values and the tax base of the community, hampers economic development, and imposes unfair costs on thousands of people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish that no American had to worry about suffering damage from a natural disaster, but it is a fact of nature that such damage can happen. That is why it is important to do what we can to help property owners have adequate insurance. The goals of the National Flood Insurance Program are important, and reauthorizing and revamping this program is necessary. This bill represents a necessary step to ensure that more at-risk property owners are protected while the cost of disaster relief and adequate  insurance is less of a burden to the average taxpayer. Flooding is a risk that many communities face, and the availability of flood insurance is important for ensuring that our citizens can recover from any losses suffered. However, this must be done in a way that does not unduly and unfairly burden our communities. I will continue to work to strengthen the National Flood Insurance Program in a fair and responsible manner as it proceeds to conference.</paragraph>

  <narrative>SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This title may be cited as the "Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 102. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the flood insurance claims resulting from the hurricane season of 2005 will likely exceed all previous claims paid by the National Flood Insurance Program; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) in order to pay the legitimate claims of policyholders from the hurricane season of 2005, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has borrowed over $20,000,000,000 from the Treasury;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the interest alone on this debt, is almost $1,000,000,000 annually, and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has indicated that it will be unable to pay back this debt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the flood insurance program must be strengthened to ensure it can pay future claims;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) while flood insurance is mandatory in the 100-year floodplain, substantial flooding occurs outside of existing special flood hazard areas;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) recent events throughout the country involving areas behind man-made structures, known as "residual risk" areas, have produced catastrophic losses;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) although such man-made structures produce an added element of safety and therefore lessen the probability that a disaster will occur, they are nevertheless susceptible to catastrophic loss, even though such areas at one time were not included within the 100-year floodplain; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) voluntary participation in the National Flood Insurance Program has been minimal and many families residing outside the 100-year floodplain remain unaware of the potential risk to their lives and property.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 103.

  <narrative>SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This title may be cited as the "Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 202. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the United States in 2005, caused, by some estimates, in excess of $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) many meteorologists predict that the United States is in a period of increased hurricane activity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the Federal Government and State governments have provided billions of dollars to pay for losses from natural catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, and other natural catastrophes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) some insurers are not renewing insurance policies, are excluding certain risks, such as wind damage, and are increasing rates and deductibles in some markets;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) the inability of property and business owners in vulnerable areas to obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage endangers the national economy and public health and safety;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) almost every State in the United States is at risk of a natural catastrophe, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, and other natural catastrophes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) building codes and land use regulations play an indispensable role in managing catastrophe risks, by preventing building in high risk areas and ensuring that appropriate mitigation efforts are completed where building has taken place;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) several proposals have been introduced in Congress to address the affordability and availability of natural catastrophe insurance across the United States, but there is no consensus on what, if any, role the Federal Government should play; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) an efficient and effective approach to assessing natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to timely report to Congress on its findings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this title referred to as the "Commission").&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 204.
