  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="Introducing S. 3045. A bill to establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Forest Heritage Area in the State of Alaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3045">S. 3045</bill>] Mr. President, the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Forest Heritage Area would be the first Heritage Area in Alaska, and one of a few Heritage Areas in the West. Our proposal encompasses the wide mountainous corridor that was the major gateway to pioneer settlement of the State, extending from Seward through the Kenai Mountains to the upper Turnagain Arm. Here mountain trails developed by indigenous First Alaskans became prospectors' trails and, eventually, the roads and  railroad used by the pioneers who settled the last frontier of the United States. Transportation, resource development and settlement in this rugged, often-treacherous landscape provide a powerful reminder of the fortitude and resourcefulness of the pioneers of America's Last Frontier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historic communities that were developed around mining and early transportation routes have preserved much of their original character. A visit to the Hope Townsite is a visit to a living community that still resembles the gold rush town that it was before the rush to the Klondike. The City of Whittier provides a glimpse of our Nation's intense effort to develop an ice-free port to supply troops who were defending our boundaries in Alaska during World War II. As in the early days, all the signs  of human activity in the corridor are dwarfed by the sweeping landscapes of the region, by the magnificence of the mountains, glaciers and tidal fjords and the dominance and power of nature. Turnagain Arm, once a critical transportation link, has one of the world's greatest tidal ranges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Heritage Area proposal, truly a grass roots product, began in 1997 when the Kenai Peninsula Historical Association asked a group of local community leaders to reach out and tell people about Heritage Areas. They were successful in garnering support from communities throughout the corridor. These local folks have extensive knowledge of the resources; they are personally acquainted with the area; they understand  the ruggedness and the beauty of the land, and certainly appreciate the potential economic value this designation would bring to the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000 these community leaders organized the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage Area Corridor Communities Association as a non-profit organization with a board of directors made up of corridor community representatives. Later a congressionally designated grant made it possible for the new non-profit to serve as a local coordinating entity and prove its ability to plan and accomplish projects consistent with Heritage Area purposes. Through their management of the grant, historic  structures were preserved, a small museum has opened, parks and pavilions with historic interpretation have been constructed, oral histories have been collected from old-timers and recorded, and an excellent book on corridor history has been published.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the corridor is within the western part of the Chugach National Forest, the Association has asked to put this Heritage Area under the Secretary of Agriculture. The bill provides for coordination with the Secretaries of Interior and includes the same components, structure and national recognition as Heritage Areas under the Secretary of Interior. Similar components assure that the Heritage Area will not impact private property rights or public land management. A Memorandum of Understanding  between the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would establish coordination at the Secretarial level. Passage of this bill will be an excellent way to commemorate the recent centennial of the Chugach National Forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to lend my support to this grassroots effort by introducing legislation today to designate the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm in Alaska as our most northern and western National Heritage Area, the first National Heritage Area in Alaska and the first National Forest Heritage Area to be assisted by the U.S. Forest Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Forest Heritage Area Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation corridor--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) is a major gateway to Alaska;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) includes a range of transportation routes used by--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) indigenous people; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) the pioneers that settled the last frontier of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) is located in the heart of the Chugach National Forest, which was established by presidential proclamation on July 23, 1907, by Theodore Roosevelt; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) includes a historically significant segment of the Iditarod Trail connecting Seward and Nome, which was--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) scouted by the Alaska Road Commission in 1908; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) designated as the Iditarod National Historic Trail in 1978;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the cultural landscape formed by indigenous people and by settlement, transportation, and modern resource development in the rugged and often treacherous natural setting of the transportation corridor provides a powerful testimony to the human fortitude, perseverance, and resourcefulness of the people who--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) settled the frontier; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) represent the proudest heritage of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the natural history and scenic splendor of the transportation corridor are equally outstanding;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the transportation corridor includes vistas of the power of nature, such as evidence of earthquake subsidence, recent avalanches, retreating glaciers, and tidal action along Turnagain Arm, which has the second greatest tidal range in the world;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) there is a national interest in recognizing, preserving, promoting, and interpreting the resources of the transportation corridor;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm region is--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) geographically and culturally cohesive; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) defined by a corridor of historic routes, trails, water, railroads, and roadways through a distinct landscape of mountains, lakes, and fjords;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the region played a unique role as a portal and transportation corridor through which indigenous people, explorers, missionaries, gold miners, cannery workers, big game hunters, homesteaders, foresters, railroad workers, military personnel, and petroleum developers traveled into southcentral and interior Alaska as part of the waves of travel that characterized the history of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) the region exhibits a high degree of integrity with vast tracks of rugged, undeveloped areas and natural scenery that still look much as the area did to the original inhabitants, the indigenous people, and early explorers and pioneers of the region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) studies that led to the designation of the Iditarod National Historic Trail, the Seward Highway All American Road, and the Alaska Railroad National Scenic Railroad--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) determined the national significance of separate transportation routes traversing the region; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) illustrate the national significance of heritage resources in the region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) designation of the transportation corridor as a national heritage area--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) provides for a comprehensive interpretation of human history in the wide transportation corridor through the Kenai Mountains and upper Turnagain Arm, including early Native trade routes, historic waterways, mining trails, historic communities, and the 3 designated routes of national significance referred to in paragraph (9);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) recognizes the national significance of the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation corridor, including--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) the historic and modern resource development of the transportation corridor; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) the cultural, natural, and recreational resources and landscapes of the transportation corridor; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) would provide assistance to local communities, Indian tribes, and residents of the transportation corridor in--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) preserving and interpreting cultural and historic resources; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) fostering cooperative planning and partnerships;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) an additional feasibility study for the Heritage Area is not needed before designation of the Heritage Area because the studies referred to in paragraph (9) provide sufficient documentation of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the national significance of heritage resources in the region; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the support of local communities for designation of the Heritage Area; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Forest Heritage Corridor Communities Association--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) has been formed as a nonprofit corporation to act as the Local Coordinating Entity for the Heritage Area;

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to create a new conditional approval system for drugs, biological products, and devices that is responsive to the needs of seriously ill patients, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3046">S. 3046</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill I introduced today: the Access, Compassion, Care and Ethics for Seriously-ill Patients Act, ACCESS, Act. I would like to thank the original Senate cosponsors: Senators BOB CASEY, NORM CROLEMAN, ARLEN SPECTER and JAMES INHOFE. I also especially thank Representative DIANNE WATSON who will be introducing the companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the current era, certain cancers and other chronic diseases touch the lives of almost every American. If you have had the experience of a family member or friend struggling with terminal illness, you were probably aware of their need and limited timeline to access promising treatments. Unfortunately, the current system often does not work for the benefit of terminally-ill patients--during emotionally-charged times, patients and their families may face regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles if  they wish to access investigational treatment options in order to preserve their lives. Many terminally-ill patients exhaust their treatment options and do not qualify for a clinical trial. They also do not physically have months to wait for an individual investigational treatment application to be approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this day and age of scientific breakthroughs, we must embrace these advances and do so with a "patient-centered" mindset. Terminally-ill patients often reach a point where the potential benefits of these breakthrough treatments outweigh their inevitable risk of death from their disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced the ACCESS Act to offer these patients an ethical option--compassionate access to treatments that show promise earlier in the drug development process. The average time for a treatment to go through the entire FDA approval process is 15 years. As a result, the current system tends to benefit future generations of patients with life-threatening diseases, rather than patients of the present time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ACCESS Act offers a new Compassionate Investigational Access approval system for treatments showing efficacy during clinical trials, for use by the seriously-ill patient population. Seriously-ill patients who have exhausted all alternatives and are seeking new treatment options, would be offered access to these treatments with the consent of their physician. This bill also improves upon the existing accelerated approval system, using a patient-centered framework. The ACCESS Act also makes  a technical correction that will increase patient access to drugs used off-label to treat life-threatening diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the ACCESS Act that would offer patients, with little hope, a chance at life.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="Introducing S.J. Res. 33. A joint resolution recognizing the efforts of the Ohio Department of Mental Health and the Ohio Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services to address the stigma associated with mental health and substance use disorders; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="sj" number="33">S.J. Res. 33</bill>] Mr. President, May is National Mental Health Month. This proud tradition was started over 50 years ago. Each May, the mental health community comes together to raise awareness about mental health disorders and to celebrate recovery. The last 50 years have seen significant progress in the treatment of mental disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that with treatment and support, it is possible to recover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Fred Frese knows this first hand. I met Dr. Frese at a roundtable that I held in Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Frese served as Director of Psychology at Western Reserve Psychiatric Hospital for 15 years. He is currently an Assistant Professor of Psychology in Clinical Psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University and Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine. He has authored and reviewed numerous articles and chapters, lectured in several countries and served on the boards of trustees of  various organizations that work on behalf of individuals with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, Dr. Frese received the Hildreth Award, the highest honor given by the American Psychological Association's Psychologists in Public Service Division. Over the course of his career, he has testified numerous times before both houses of the United States Congress. Dr. Frese's career has been remarkable. His life has been remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been living with paranoid schizophrenia since 1966. Dr. Frese is remarkable. But his recovery is not unusual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people stricken with mental illness can and do recover with appropriate treatment. But the stigma associated with mental health disorders can discourage people from getting the help they need. The U.S. Surgeon General's seminal report on mental health cites stigma as a significant barrier to recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to say that Ohio's Departments of Mental Health and Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services are doing something about it. They have launched a "Think Outside the Stigma" campaign, a public information effort to increase awareness about the misperceptions associated with mental health and substance use disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am introducing a resolution commending this campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague in the house, Congressman Zack Space, is offering a companion resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine a world where individuals with mental disorders are supported and treated, not marginalized and discriminated against. Imagine a world where we see individuals first and disability second. Imagine the wealth of talent and resources that individuals with mental illness can realize with treatment. Individuals like Dr. Frese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must work together to overcome the unfair and unnecessary burden of stigma associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. We know that treatment can work. We know that people can recover. We know that Americans are well worth the investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that Americans are well worth the investment.</paragraph>
