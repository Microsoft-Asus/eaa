    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today also to honor the state of Israel which will celebrate its 60th anniversary in May. The relationship between the United States and Israel is indeed a special one. Israel has been our close friend and ally through the Cold War and now in the global war on terror. It is a relationship that will continue to strengthen in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after 60 years, Israel continues to fight for its very survival against relentless attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. The United States and Israel must always stand in complete solidarity against those nations and groups that seek to destroy Israel. We have stood together against anti-Semitism for the last 60 years, and we will continue to do so for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Israeli government and the Israeli people on their special day. May God continue to bless the very close American relationship with Israel not only in this special year, but for all eternity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
