  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's that time of year again. Just as families are preparing to hit the road for their summer vacations, the gas prices are once again hitting record highs. Drivers are paying a heavy price for the Bush administration's failure to enact a comprehensive energy strategy. And just last week, the President attempted to show that he's taking action by announcing an Executive Order that doesn't call for any action until a few weeks before he leaves office. This is simply too  little, too late. Where has he been for the last 6 years when prices were hitting record numbers each Memorial Day?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic Congress refuses to ignore this problem. We passed legislation that will roll back $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies for Big Oil, and instead we would reinvest here at home in clean alternative fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming weeks we will bring legislation to the House floor that will crack down on price gouging by the big oil companies so we can provide immediate relief to consumers. Unlike the Bush administration, the Democratic Congress is not simply going to ignore this problem.</paragraph>
