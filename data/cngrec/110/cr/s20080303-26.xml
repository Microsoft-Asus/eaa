    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to mark the loss of an outstanding American intellect--and, what's more, a decent and a well-loved man. William F. Buckley, Jr., died last week at the age of 82. He was found at work at his desk, pen in hand--and I don't think he could have imagined a more fitting exit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few thinkers were more prolific than Bill Buckley--his total catalogue amounts to more than 50 books and thousands and thousands of columns, not to mention his three decades on the pioneering debate program "Firing Line." Few writers wielded more influence--the entire modern conservative movement honors him as its founder. And few figures in our national life earned such admiration-- all the way from Ronald Reagan, who told Buckley, "You didn't just part the Red Sea--you rolled it back, dried  it up and  left it exposed, for all the world to see," to the many writers, activists, and leaders who counted him as a mentor and inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a good friend of my parents, Thomas and Grace Dodd, and one of Connecticut's best-known native sons. I was especially proud to see him in attendance at the dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Library in Storrs; like my father, Bill Buckley was a dedicated foe of totalitarianism in all its forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of his death, tributes have risen from left and right and from every point in between. Even those who stood against Bill's staunch conservatism respected his intellectual rigor and integrity. In the inaugural issue of National Review, which Bill launched in 1955 at the age of 30, he wrote this: "Our political economy and our high-energy industry run on large, general principles, on ideas--not by day-to-day guess work, expedients and improvisations. Ideas have to go into exchange  to become or remain operative; and the medium of such exchange is the printed word." It was that commitment to ideas, to reasoned and courteous debate, that we appreciated most in Bill and that we will miss most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His intellectual honesty spared neither himself nor his friends. When he changed his mind--as he did on civil rights, on Vietnam, and on Iraq--he did it publicly and forthrightly. And long after the movement he founded took on a life of its own, Bill continued to hold it to his high standards and to call it to account. In his last years, he wrote: "Conservatives pride themselves on resisting change, which is as it should be. But intelligent deference to tradition and stability can evolve into  intellectual sloth and moral fanaticism, as when conservatives simply decline to look up from dogma because the effort to raise their heads and reconsider is too great."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill resisted dogma, not because it was often wrong but because it was always lazy. He was too energetic for that. And while he pioneered new thinking, worked to rid the conservative movement of xenophobia, and even staged a quixotic run for mayor of New York City--asked what he would do if elected, he replied: "Demand a recount!"--he developed a one-of-a-kind prose style and public persona. "I am lapidary but not eristic when I use big words," he said. Those are my thoughts exactly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Buckley lived a full life, devoted to words, to ideas, and to his deeply-held principles. We didn't agree on much. But given his grace, his wit, and his deep erudition, I can think of few people with whom disagreement was so agreeable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I request unanimous consent that the attached article, "May We Not Lose His Kind," be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>May We Not Lose His Kind</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Peggy Noonan)</narrative>
  <narrative>He was sui generis, wasn't he? The complete American original, a national treasure, a man whose energy was a kind of optimism, and whose attitude toward life, even when things seemed to others bleak, was summed up in something he said to a friend: "Despair is a mortal sin."</narrative>
  <narrative>I am not sure conservatives feel despair at Bill Buckley's leaving--he was 82 and had done great work in a lifetime filled with pleasure--but I know they, and many others, are sad, and shaken somehow. On Wednesday, after word came that he had left us, in a television studio where I'd gone to try and speak of some of his greatness, a celebrated liberal academic looked at me stricken, and said he'd just heard the news. "I can't imagine a world without Bill Buckley in it," he said. I said, "Oh,  that is exactly it."</narrative>
  <narrative>It is. What a space he filled.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is commonplace to say that Bill Buckley brought American conservatism into the mainstream. That's not quite how I see it. To me he came along in the middle of the last century and reminded demoralized American conservatism that it existed. That it was real, that it was in fact a majority political entity, and that it was inherently mainstream. This was after the serious drubbing inflicted by Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal and the rise of modern liberalism. Modern liberalism at that  point was a real something, a palpable movement formed by FDR and continued by others. Opposing it was ..... what exactly? Robert Taft? The ghost of Calvin Coolidge? Buckley said in effect, Well, there's something known as American conservatism, though it does not even call itself that.</narrative>
  <narrative>He explained, remoralized, brought together those who saw it as he did, and began the process whereby American conservatism came to know itself again. And he did it primarily through a magazine, which he with no modesty decided was going to be the central and most important organ of resurgent conservatism. National Review would be highly literate, philosophical, witty,  of the moment, with an &#xE9;lan, a teasing quality that made you feel you didn't just get a subscription, you joined something. You entered a world of thought.</narrative>
  <narrative>I thought it beautiful and inspiring that he was open to, eager for, friendships from all sides, that even though he cared passionately about political questions, politics was not all, cannot be all, that people can be liked for their essence, for their humor and good nature and intelligence, for their attitude toward life itself. He and his wife, Pat, were friends with lefties and righties, from National Review to the Paris Review. It was moving too that his interests were so broad, that he  could go from an appreciation of the metaphors of Norman Mailer to essays on classical music to an extended debate with his beloved friend the actor David Niven on the best brands of peanut butters. When I saw him last he was in a conversation with the historian Paul Johnson on the relative merits of the work of the artist Raeburn.</narrative>
  <narrative>His broad-gaugedness, his refusal to be limited, seemed to me a reflection in part of a central conservative tenet, as famously expressed by Samuel Johnson. "How small of all that human hearts endure / That part which laws or kings can cause or cure." When you have it right about laws and kings, and what life is, then your politics become grounded in the facts of life. And once they are grounded, you don't have to hold to them so desperately. You can relax and have fun. Just because you're  serious doesn't mean you're grim.</narrative>
  <narrative>Buckley was a one-man refutation of Hollywood's idea of a conservative. He was rising in the 1950s and early '60s, and Hollywood's idea of a conservative was still Mr. Potter, the nasty old man of "It's a Wonderful Life," who would make a world of grubby Pottersvilles if he could, who cared only about money and the joy of bullying idealists. Bill Buckley's persona, as the first famous conservative of the modern media age, said no to all that. Conservatives are brilliant, capacious, full of  delight at the world and full of mischief, too. That's what he was. He upended old clich&#xE9;s.</narrative>
  <narrative>This was no small thing, changing this template. Ronald Reagan was the other who changed it, by being a sunny man, a happy one. They were friends, admired each other, had two separate and complementary roles. Reagan was in the game of winning votes, of persuading, of leading a political movement that catapulted him to two terms as governor of California, the nation's biggest state, at a time when conservatives were seemingly on the defensive but in retrospect were rising to new heights. He would  speak to normal people and persuade them of the efficacy of conservative solutions to pressing problems. Buckley's job was not reaching on-the-ground voters, or reaching voters at all, and his attitude toward his abilities in that area was reflected in his merry answer when asked what he would do if he won the mayoralty of New York. "Demand a recount," he famously replied. His role was speaking to those thirsting for</narrative>
  <narrative>I share here a fear. It is not that the conservative movement is ending, that Bill's death is the period on a long chapter. The house he helped build had--has--many mansions. Conservatism will endure if it is rooted in truth, and in the truths of life. It is.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is rather that with the loss of Bill Buckley we are, as a nation, losing not only a great man. When Jackie Onassis died, a friend of mine who knew her called me and said, with such woe, "Oh, we are losing her kind." He meant the elegant, the cultivated, the refined. I thought of this with Bill's passing, that we are losing his kind--people who were deeply, broadly educated in great universities when they taught deeply and broadly, who held deep views of life and the world and art and all  the things that make life more delicious and more meaningful. We have work to do as a culture in bringing up future generations that are so well rounded, so full and so inspiring.</narrative>
  <narrative>Bill Buckley lived a great American life. His heroism was very American--the individualist at work in the world, the defender of great creeds and great beliefs going forth with spirit, style and joy. May we not lose his kind. For now, "Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels take thee to thy rest."</narrative>
