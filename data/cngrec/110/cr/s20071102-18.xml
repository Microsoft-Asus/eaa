  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to a historic church celebrating its 120th anniversary on November 10 to 11, 2007. Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Omaha, NE, was founded in 1887 and continues to thrive as it serves a vast congregation within the minority community living in Nebraska's largest city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This anniversary is a significant achievement, especially for an institution born during a time of racial bigotry and hatred in America. The church's founding required the strength, courage, and faith of early African-American leaders, who recognized the importance of their mission to create a church which has now succeeded in delivering the Word of God to generations in three different centuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mount Moriah Baptist Church has an interesting history. It was first organized in 1867, but due to the lack of a Black presence, membership declined. Then in 1887, the Reverend Amos Johnson organized a new baptist church with just seven members. A name was not immediately selected for the newly organized body. Finally, in 1888, the parishioners settled on Mount Pisgah Baptist Church. However, in 1897, the Enterprise newspaper reported the resignation of the Reverend R. January, who asked some  of the church members to form a new congregation. The remaining members reorganized their congregation as the Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mount Moriah, whose name means "prepared for God," has had to survive numerous challenges, including several changes in location and a fire which caused significant damage during the mid-1920s. In 1956, during the administration of Reverend St. Clair, who served for 20 years, the church underwent extensive renovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 12 decades after it was formed, Mount Moriah Baptist Church remains a focal point in Omaha, NE, just as its namesake, Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, has always been a focal point in biblical history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend Rev. Ralph B. Lassiter, Sr., and the congregation of Mount Moriah Baptist Church of Omaha, NE, for continuing the long and glorious tradition of teaching the Bible and its meaning and training the faithful how to live its message. Your service is truly admirable.</paragraph>
