  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6710]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to ask my friend, the majority leader, to give us an update on what he plans to bring to the floor next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Republican whip for yielding. On Monday, the House will meet in pro forma session at 12:30 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of suspensions will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we will consider <bill type="h" number="3999">H.R. 3999</bill>, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act and <bill type="h" number="5501">H.R. 5501</bill> the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will also consider legislation to address the housing crisis, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Finally, we may also consider additional energy-related legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>On the topic of additional energy-related legislation, I know we just had a bill on the floor on energy. It was a heated debate. And while a majority voted for the bill, it didn't pass. I wonder if there is any opportunity that bill might come back next week with a rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have not discussed that yet. We regret it, of course, that it didn't pass. But having said that, I'm sure there will be discussions as to what the next steps will be. But I am not prepared to announce what they will be, mainly because I'm not sure what they will be at this point in time. But we are still very interested in the proposition, as you know, that that legislation spoke to, and that is providing an accelerated exploration, discovery and exploitation of our energy here  in the United States, drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, building a line to get not only the oil, but also natural gas down to the lower 48, and to ensure that companies aren't inventorying property on which either they or others might be producing energy for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we believe the provisions of that bill are important. And I would think that we're going to be looking at ways in which we may move forward on that. But it has not been decided.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that. As you mentioned, there is lots of interest in the bill. I appreciate the fact that we were able to extend debate, even on a suspension bill. But I think this is a topic where certainly both sides evidenced a willingness to discuss it. And we need to do that. And I would hope to see more energy legislation on the floor and would hope to have it under a rule if that is at all possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On appropriations, last week I mentioned that the chairman, the appropriations chairman, had appeared to announce that there would be no appropriations work on the floor. Your comment at the time, if I recall, was that that had not been a decision that you and the other leaders had made yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Speaker announced that the House would consider the Defense bill before October. I'm wondering if you have any idea when that might happen and if there is a chance that  the five other bills that are out of committee could also get to the floor before October, and what could happen with the Interior bill which would obviously be the most important bill as it relates to this topic of energy that we just discussed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with the Speaker that it is our intention to move the Defense bill. We think that is critically important to do. We think it's critically important to move the other bills as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was having a discussion with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee during the last vote. I asked him about his discussions with Mr. Lewis to try to facilitate the consideration of appropriation bills. My belief is that they hadn't made as much progress as he had hoped to make, but with relation to the other bills, I will just reiterate what I have said, that I continue to talk to Mr. Obey about my hope that we can find a way to move appropriation bills to the floor  if that is possible. But we have not gotten any scheduled at this point. We do intend to move certainly the Defense bill. The Speaker was accurate on that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that. And the Defense bill certainly is critical, as all these bills are. And obviously I share the sense that it's a primary responsibility of the Federal Government to defend the country. But the Homeland Security bill, the Military Construction and Veterans bill also are particularly important components of that very element of what we do, and other bills that are out such as the Financial Services bill, all the discussions we're having and will have about  housing over the next few days, but another bill where if we knew that the regulators were funded and how they were funded and the other things that happened, that is a helpful thing to know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is all the questions I have for today, and I would yield back.</paragraph>
