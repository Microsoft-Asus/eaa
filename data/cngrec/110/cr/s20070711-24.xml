  <narrative>HONORING COLONEL GARY B. CARNEY -- (Senate - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9015">S9015</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I honor a retiring soldier from my home state. Colonel Gary B. Carney demonstrated exceptional meritorious service as Commander of McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, MCAAP, Oklahoma, the largest U.S. government-owned, government-operated explosive ammunition plant. The plant has a storage capacity of more than six million square feet, and stores more than 700,000 tons of ammunition valued at more than $65 billion. He skillfully balanced management of this significant  portion of the total defense ammunition stockpile mission with the plant's other mission as the sole Department of Defense source for bomb production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Carney effectively managed both manufacturing and depot operations stemming from Operating Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. During his tenure Colonel Carney oversaw an increase in revenue not seen since the Vietnam Era, totaling $228.2M. Also during his tenure the plant shipped 32,680 short tons of munitions, the largest tonnage shipped to date in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expansion of the public/private partnership program occurred under his leadership as well. The commercial industry partnership business base at MCAAP increased four-fold under Colonel Carney's leadership. Additionally, MCAAP was selected as the integrator for the Excalibur guided projectile in partnership with Raytheon. The Raytheon/MCAAP team fielded the Excalibur, the newest and most accurate projectile, three months ahead of schedule, significantly enhancing our military's warfighting capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his leadership, MCAAP led the way in Lean Six Sigma, LSS, with actual/cost avoidance savings of $5.319M. LSS training intensified so that 28 employees received green belt training while 18 received black belt training; 29 completed LSS executive training and 22 more completed project sponsor/project selection training. All MCAAP employees received Lean Six Sigma awareness training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 MCAAP's ammunition inventory accountability received an overall green rating in 10 out of 10 major functional areas during the Supply Depot Operations review. This rating and rapid turn-around is a marked improvement over previous years. This significant achievement was directly orchestrated by Colonel Carney through his initiative, leadership, tenacity and ability to motivate the work force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Carney's business acumen, dedication to duty, vision and ability to inspire and lead people reflect great credit upon himself, the Joint Munitions Command and the U.S. Army. On behalf of the U.S. Senate and a grateful Nation, I would like to wish him congratulations on a job well done.</paragraph>
