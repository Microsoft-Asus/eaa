    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart, saddened and angered by the violence that shook my State of Colorado yesterday. On a day that many Americans devote to family and faith, we awoke to news that two of our young people had been shot dead early Sunday morning on the grounds of Faith Bible Church in Arvada, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tiffany Johnson was only 26 years old. Philip Crouse was 24 years old. They were killed, and two of their colleagues were injured as they worked at Youth With a Mission dormitory, waiting to welcome back kids who were returning from a late night youth bowling trip.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few hours later, 70 miles to the south, in Colorado Springs, violence again dared to enter a place of worship on Sunday. A gunman armed with a high-powered rifle, stormed into New Life Church, killing two sisters, Stephanie Works, age 18, and Rachael Works, age 16, and injuring four others, including their father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only the quick thinking and bravery of a security guard was able to stop the rampage. Law enforcement officials throughout the day yesterday, last night and today, are working at top speed to get to the bottom of what happened. They have the full support of Governor Ritter of Colorado, Federal agencies, and numerous State and local law enforcement agencies that are working in this investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former attorney general of Colorado, I know firsthand the extraordinary capabilities of our local and State law officials. I have full and complete confidence in their abilities. But having overseen investigations, including the investigation of the shooting at Columbine High School, I know that however successful we may be in uncovering what happened and bringing justice to those responsible, the transgressions the Nation witnessed yesterday defy reason and comprehension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sunday's violence has no place in our society. That five people were shot is a terrible tragedy, no matter in what city, neighborhood or street that kind of violence occurs. But that this barbarity invaded two places of worship, where young people were serving their community and where families were attending a Sunday service, stirs a particular outrage in all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are certain sanctuaries we share, and they should never, ever see bloodshed. Schools are sanctuaries. Our homes are sanctuaries. Churches, mosques, synagogues, and other houses of worship are sanctuaries. When these places come under attack, for whatever reason, we all suffer, for our right to pray in peace should be inviolate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When someone undermines this right, we are compelled to respond. We are compelled to respond not just with the force of law but by mobilizing the force of our shared values and of our community. We must rebuild that sense of security that should envelop every house of worship in this country. Americans should never feel fear in a place of faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers today are with the victims of yesterday's attacks, with their families and friends. To those who lost a son, a daughter or a friend, I know no words can assuage the pain you feel. I can only hope that in time your memories of the service, faith, and love of those you lost will overcome the senselessness of this terrible tragedy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express, on behalf of myself and my wife Joan, our devastation and heartfelt sadness for both the families and communities that are suffering as a result of the senseless shootings yesterday in Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every shooting, and every loss of an innocent life, is a terrible blow. But, shootings at schools or churches hit an especially weak spot in our public armor. They hurt our Nation in a deeper and more profound way and we mourn for the families and communities of those who have been affected by the tragedies this weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first attack on Sunday occurred at 12:30 a.m. and left two victims dead and two other wounded at the Youth with a Mission center in metro Denver. The second, 12 hours later in Colorado Springs, left two dead and three others wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two killed at the Youth with a Mission center were a young woman from Minnesota and a young man from Alaska. They were at the center to learn how to better spread the message of their faith. The two wounded at the center are in the hospital, one in critical condition and one in fair condition. The two victims who lost their lives at the New Life Church were teenage sisters, shot in the parking lot as they left a worship service. Three others, including the father of the two teenage victims,  were also wounded at the church and are recovering from injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were 7,000 people at the New Life Church yesterday when the shooting took place. A volunteer security guard stopped this murderer just inside the building, saving an unknown--but certainly large number of those from being attacked as well. The name and background of the security guard who stopped the gunman are still being withheld, but she bravely acted on her instincts and training. With quick and decisive action, she returned fire with the gunman, fatally wounding him. This real-life  hero has been widely credited today for saving hundreds of lives inside the church. I join with the people of Colorado in praising her actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope we can find the time to consider the church members lost in Colorado yesterday, the heartache of those left behind, and the valiant action of those who stopped the tragedy from spreading and helped those in need.</paragraph>
