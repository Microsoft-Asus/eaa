    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment about the pending efforts to structure a comprehensive immigration reform bill. There are many questions which are being asked today in the corridors by members of the media as to what is happening on the efforts to structure a bill to come before the Senate next week, where a cloture vote is scheduled for Monday afternoon to proceed. The efforts to structure legislation have been in process now for 3 months. There have been approximately  30 meetings held for durations customarily of 2 hours or longer, customarily attended by 8, 10, or 12 Senators. It is unusual to have a dozen Senators sit still in a room for 2 hours, but that has happened repeatedly as we have struggled through the very complex issues while trying for comprehensive immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have bypassed the Judiciary Committee in this effort. Perhaps it was a mistake. In the 109th Congress, we laboriously worked through and produced a bill which came to the Senate floor and which was ultimately passed. There is a great deal to be said for regular order, where we have a text, amendments are proposed, there is debate, there are votes, and we move ahead through the committee system. The decision was made early on not to utilize regular order in the traditional committee system,  and it may well have been an error, as we have been struggling to come to terms with a consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, there were extensive meetings with Republicans alone. Democrats met separately. Then there have been the bipartisan meetings, as we have struggled to come to terms. The meetings have virtually gone round the clock. The staff has literally worked round the clock, the past weekend, both Saturday and Sunday, and the previous weekend. The administration has been dedicated; the President has been personally involved in the discussions. A group of us met with the President yesterday. Immigration  was discussed. The administration has devoted the time of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Commerce, who have been parties to these lengthy meetings, always present for the duration of the session. We think we are coming very close, but as we move through the analysis and discussion, it has been apparent that no matter what legislation is produced, it will be unsatisfactory to both ends of the political spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has already been criticized for being too lenient on undocumented immigrants and providing amnesty at one end of the political spectrum. It has been criticized at the other end of the political spectrum for not being sufficiently humanitarian and compassionate to the immigrants. Even though we have yet to produce a bill, it has been subjected to criticism. We have found that around the country some 90 cities have been engaged in legislative efforts with either passed or rejected laws  trying to deal with immigrants' landlords. In my State, the city of Hazleton is trying to deal with the issue. Recently, we had a conspiracy by six men charged with a terrorist plot to attack the soldiers at Fort Dix. Three of those who have been charged are undocumented immigrants from Yugoslavia, illegal immigrants. There has been a virtual breakdown of law and order, as we have in this country an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the criticism expressed at one end of the political spectrum that there is amnesty here. That is factually wrong. Those who will be placed at the end of the citizenship line will be those who do not have criminal records. Where we can identify those with criminal records, they should be deported. You can't deport 12 million undocumented immigrants who are here illegally, but you can deport those who have criminal records. Those who will be placed at the end of the line for citizenship  will be those who have paid their taxes, those who have established a good work record, those who were contributing in a constructive way to the American way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When objections are raised as to amnesty, the question is returned: What more can be done with these 12 million undocumented immigrants? What more hurdles can be placed to be sure we do the maximum to avoid the charge of amnesty? We are still open for suggestions. But the consequence of not moving to a solution on this issue is that we have anarchy. We have uncontrolled borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are working on goes a long way. It increases the number of Border Patrol officers from 12,000 to 18,000. It will have 200 miles of vehicle barriers and 370 miles of fencing, 70 ground-based radar and camera towers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and detention space to hold some 27,500 daily on an annual basis. We have interior security provisions. We have tough employer sanctions because we are structuring a system where we can make a positive identification as to who is legal and  who is illegal. This is an appropriate basis for imposing tough sanctions on employers if they hire illegal immigrants, because they are in a position to make a determination as to who is legal or who is illegal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the other end of the political spectrum, there are objections that the  program is not sufficiently humanitarian, not sufficiently compassionate, and does not sufficiently provide for family unification. If we are to handle the backlog of people who have been waiting to come into this country with the existing requirements to gain citizenship, and if we are to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants, we will have to have additional green  cards. But there will have to be limitations so we do not have what is euphemistically referred to as chain immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working on a points system which we are trying to balance. It is very hard to satisfy all competing interests, to balance the demand for Ph.D.s and highly skilled people with the desire to provide opportunities for people who  are not highly skilled. Certain points are being given to recognize the family, to have as many family members and as much on family reunification as we can, within a balanced system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The old adage that the devil is in the details is obviously present here. This morning one group of Senators met at a little after 9; another group of Senators met at 10:15. We are continuing the meetings as we try to come to grips and resolve these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The whole immigration issue is another third rail in politics. Social Security has been described as the third rail of our political system. There is no doubt that immigration is another third rail. It may supplant Social Security as the third rail of the political system because, no matter what we do here, both ends of the political spectrum will criticize us--criticize us for amnesty on one hand, criticize us on the other end of the political spectrum for not being sufficiently compassionate.  Politically, it is a loser for those who are engaged in it. But we have a public duty to come to grips with this issue and to have comprehensive immigration reform. We can do that and insist on having border patrols and employer sanctions before we work through the guest worker program. It is truly, as we are structuring it, a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important thing, as I see it, is to move ahead and persevere, to try to structure a bill which is now 380 pages long--it is in text, thanks to the dedicated work of the staff--and to present it on the floor of the Senate and have the Senate work its will. Aside from the political perils, the object is to restore the rule of law and to bring these 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. The advantage to society generally is to eliminate this massive underclass, this  massive number of individuals who are in the shadows, and to structure a system where they will, at the outset, have visas to stay here for as long as they like, so long as they comply with our laws and get into the citizenship line at the rear. We are looking to reestablish the rule of law and to avoid the anarchy which now characterizes our immigration system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
