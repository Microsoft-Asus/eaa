    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are saying we must have an end to the war, as have two Republican Senators. It is time for us to look at the actions of the Vice President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You remember when George Bush sent DICK CHENEY out to find a Vice President and he found himself? Well, if you read the last 4 days of The Washington Post, you read a chilling picture of the actions of the Vice President as he manipulated the intelligence leading us into the war. He has been the driving force to keep us in that war and still is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then when questioned about what he does over there, he says, I am not a member of the executive. I don't know exactly. I have an office here, but I am not covered by the things the President says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This man has been evading an Executive Order from 2003 by the President of the United States that everyone tell how they are covering classified material. But the Vice President is above that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vice President is not above investigation by the House of Representatives for his actions in taking us into war and keeping us there.</paragraph>
