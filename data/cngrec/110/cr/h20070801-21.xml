    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to talk about Shaymaa el-Sayed, an Egyptian woman. Security forces in Egypt tortured this young woman for converting  to Christianity. Fanatic relatives of Shaymaa el-Sayed, 26 years old, attacked her in Alexandria, beating her, attempting to shove her into a car and vowing to kill her for her "apostasy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Police intervened. They arrested the victim herself. When they found her Christian identity papers, local police transferred her to a state security investigation office where the officials forcibly disrobed and photographed her naked in front of all the policemen at the station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was repeatedly subjected to interrogation and severe torture, including electrocution. She was released by the Egyptian police into the custody of her family despite their threats to kill her. "This is not legal treatment, but it is happening all the time," said Rasha Noor, an Egyptian human rights activist. "The Christians from Muslim backgrounds can't change their identities, so they are forced by the authorities to return back to Islam, or else."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless this young woman.</paragraph>
