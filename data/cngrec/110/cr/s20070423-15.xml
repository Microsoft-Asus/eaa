    <paragraph>Madam President, today I commemorate National Small Business Week, which President Bush designated for April 22-28, 2007. As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I simply cannot understate the vital role of small business in our Nation's economy. Small businesses comprise 99 percent of all businesses in the United States, employ more than half of the total private sector workforce, and are responsible for the creation of more than two-thirds  of all new jobs each year. It is essential that we in Congress continue to support small businesses' efforts to grow and do what they do best--create new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is one concern we have all heard time and again, it is the exorbitant cost to small businesses of providing health insurance to their employees. In fact, small business owners in all 50 States have cited rising health insurance costs as their number one concern. Health insurance premiums have increased at double-digit percentage levels in 4 of the past 6 years--far outpacing inflation and wage gains. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, last year the average health policy for an  individual was $4,242; the average family plan cost $11,480.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we are all well aware, these sharply rising costs are leading fewer and fewer small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees. According to Kaiser, in 2002, 58 percent of our Nation's smallest businesses, those with less than 10 employees, offered health insurance. In 2004, only 52 percent were able to offer their employees health insurance. Today, just 48 percent of our smallest businesses are now able to offer health insurance as a workplace benefit. As you can see, that is  a 10 percentage point reduction over the past 5 years. Clearly, we are heading in the wrong direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further compounding the problem is the fact that small group insurance markets exhibit no real competition. No competition means higher costs. And higher costs mean no health insurance. I recently requested a Government Accountability Office report, which revealed a staggering consolidation in the State small group insurance markets. Today, the five largest carriers now have more than a 75 percent market share in 26 States--and control 98 percent of the small group market in Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This trend is simply unacceptable and represents nothing short of a crisis--and one that can and must be fixed, now. In the Senate, I have been a longstanding champion of small business health plans and I have introduced legislation in the past two Congresses that would allow small businesses to "pool" together, across State lines, and offer uniform health insurance plans to their employees, at significantly lower costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that small business health plans are a critical solution to the small business health insurance crisis. It is a matter of simple fairness. Just like larger businesses and unions, I believe small businesses should have the option to purchase health plans across State lines with uniform benefits packages. It would allow them to shop for affordable, quality plans with much lower administrative costs while at the same time drastically shrinking the ranks of the nearly 47 million  Americans living without health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moving forward this year, we need to leave no stone unturned in our search for solutions to this crisis. For example, we should examine ways to use the Tax Code as a mechanism for increasing access to health care, including through "pooling mechanisms, and injecting competition into the State small group insurance markets. This is why I am currently working with a number of my colleagues in the Senate, on both sides of the political aisle, to forge a bipartisan bill that will pass the Senate  and be signed into law. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus has announced that we will soon consider health care legislation in the Finance Committee--and I look forward to a robust productive debate there. I also thank Senator Enzi for all of his tremendous efforts in getting legislation passed through the HELP Committee last year, and for having that legislation considered on the Senate floor for the first time ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, now is a time for action, not words. It is incumbent upon this Congress to think "outside of the box" to solve this crisis. We need to consider all options on the table, including a number of recently passed State reforms. We are at a critical juncture on this issue. The United States has the greatest health care system in the world, and yet nearly 47 million Americans are uninsured. Our goal ought to be providing health care access for all, and that means greatly expanding coverage  so that we can significantly reduce our Nation's uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must figure out how to solve the persistent criticisms that have mired small business health insurance legislation in Congress. We must address how to allow health insurers to provide lower cost products to small businesses across State lines while maintaining the most widely accepted and necessary benefits and services. We must tackle questions of how to "rate," or price, these products--and also how this can be done in a uniform manner, without jeopardizing consumer protections. And we  can and we must do all this without injuring existing health insurance markets in the States. Plain and simple, Congress must bring up small business health insurance legislation this year, in a bipartisan, comprehensive way that can secure significant bipartisan support.</paragraph>
