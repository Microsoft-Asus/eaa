    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his comments about my colleague, Senator Kennedy, who I know, if he were here, would be equally grateful. I am not going to be addressing the issue of Senator Kennedy's birthday today. I will do so tomorrow. But we are all grateful for Senator Byrd and what he represents in the Senate. There is nobody who knows the record of my colleague better, who has served with him longer, or who has been through  more battles with him than Senator Byrd. We are grateful for those comments.</paragraph>
