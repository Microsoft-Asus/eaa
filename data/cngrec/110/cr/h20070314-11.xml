    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats and the Speaker of the House arranged for a conference room in the Capitol to be used by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, an Islamic advocacy group which refuses to disavow terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CAIR officials have been charged with, and some convicted of, offenses related to the support of terrorism, including a CAIR fundraiser, Rabih Haddad, as well as a founding board member and a former CAIR civil rights coordinator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most notably, the CAIR fund-raiser Haddad was deported to Lebanon in 2003 after being arrested in a raid on an Islamic charity that Federal officials said, "provided assistance to Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network and other known terrorist groups."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apparently, the Democrats live in some parallel universe where it is okay to set up a meeting in the Capitol for a group with known terrorist ties. The American people must ask about this colossal failure of judgment. With friends like these, imagine our enemies.</paragraph>
