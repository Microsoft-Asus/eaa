  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the chairman of the committee, Chairman Frank, from the great State of Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation began last year when she was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, which you, Mr. Speaker, now chair, and in a bipartisan way we've brought forward this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A brief history here. The administration, I think, made an error in granting authority to the company, Dubai Ports World, to take over seaports. They should have anticipated the reaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it was a mistake to let Dubai buy those ports and I'm glad that that was dropped, but I think there was an overreaction. Foreign direct investment is a very good thing for our country. It is a source of jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when I first came here in the early 1980s one of our major goals on the Democratic side, with a lot of Republican support, was to get more foreign direct investment. We had a bill we called the domestic content bill. It was to require that a certain percentage of each car sold in America be made in America, and the purpose of that was frankly to help get Japanese, at that time, automakers to come here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People should understand foreign direct investment means we're talking direct investment as opposed to buying our bonds or buying financial instruments. It means putting money in here that creates jobs, and it ought to be something welcomed. In a few cases, there could be a problem, but the general rule should be that we welcome foreign direct investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, after the Dubai Ports and the reaction to it, concern grew in the rest of the world that we were not fully supportive of foreign direct investment, and there was this view that we had scared it away. I mention that because there are some who have incorrectly reported this bill, the CFIUS bill as we call it, the bill giving statutory reform to the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S., as an effort further to restrict foreign direct investment. That is the exact opposite of the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've worked very closely here, not just with the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, a great supporter of foreign direct investment, but also with the Financial Services Forum headed by the former Secretary of Commerce, Don Evans. He's been a real leader in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an effort by the Congress to make clear that we welcome foreign direct investment as a rule, but we will have procedures in place to prevent those exceptional examples where it might be problematic, where it might cause a security problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I, again, want to stress this is the Congress of the United States reaffirming that foreign direct investment is a good thing for our economy, and it is our belief that the structure we have set up will help move things quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, Mr. Speaker, people won't be required to go through the CFIUS process, but they will be given assurance if they do that they can go forward. Now, that's very important  for people making investments. So this is a wholly supportive operation, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio who have worked hard on this; the minority whip, the gentleman from Missouri, who is one of those who helped lead the fight for this.  This is a genuine bipartisan bill. We passed it last year, and it's something that I know you will find it hard to believe, Mr. Speaker, after we passed the bill, somehow the United States Senate was unable to do that. I know that will cause some surprise to you, but there we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, it's different. We passed the bill, and the Senate under the leadership of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, has passed a very similar bill, not identical, but they're close. I prefer in a few details what we have, but given the nature of the legislative process, we thought the best thing to do in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and with both parties was to accept the Senate version.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is accepting the Senate version, but we're accepting the Senate version of our version because what the Senate did was to make some fairly small changes in the bill that we adopted last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm ready to yield. My understanding is that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who is concerned about this bill, wanted to raise a technical point. So I would ask the gentlewoman from New York if she would yield to the gentleman from Missouri for the purposes of his and I having a colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. MALONEY from New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my distinguished colleague, IKE SKELTON, as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, and I voted for it when it first came through House, passing by a vote of 423-0. I support the bill because it will protect the critical technologies and the critical infrastructure of this country by ensuring that these invaluable assets remain in friendly and responsible hands. In so doing, it strengthens our national security, and I think the bill makes many needed changes, especially by adding homeland security and critical infrastructure as essential elements  to be considered for protection during national security investigations, and also by adding opportunities for congressional oversight in the process. In short, I'm in complete agreement with the intent of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've been working with the chairman, however, to try and clarify some elements of the bill that may not make the intent of Congress fully clear. I believe that it is the intent of the Congress in this legislation to extend the current practice of seeking consensus in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States. This practice requires that transactions being reviewed and investigated by the committee must satisfy the concerns of all the agencies involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that it is also Congress' intent under this legislation that the appropriate committees of the House, including all relevant committees with a jurisdictional interest in the outcomes of specific transactions under review, be kept informed by the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, I believe that it's the intent of Congress in this legislation to require the executive branch to monitor and enforce the mitigation agreements imposed under this legislation to ensure compliance and to regularly review compliance with these mitigation agreements.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield to me, I would say that I share the chairman of the Armed Services Committee's desire that the intent of Congress be clear. I also note the chairman has identified a technical error in the Senate amendment which should be corrected involving required reports of presidential decisions. I will work to accomplish a correction of this error, and I agree with the gentleman's statement of what the legislation intended and in the  specific incidents that he cited.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I certainly thank the chairman. I agree that there is a technical change required in the bill to ensure that Congress' intent be followed. I note that one good opportunity for making this technical and clarifying change to this bill will come during the House-Senate conference on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. Will the chairman work with me to ensure that this technical and clarifying change can be made to this bill, including having it considered  during the conference on the National Defense Authorization Act?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield to me, I'm glad to say, yes, I will work with the gentleman to ensure that this technical and clarifying change is made, and I agree with him the best way to do that is through the conference on the National Defense Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while this technically falls in the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee, I am deviating from the script I was given to say that I think the besetting sin of this place is an excessive concern about turf. The people who put jurisdiction ahead of substance really should think better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am delighted to be able to provide an example of intercommittee cooperation with my very good friend whom I admire, the gentleman from Missouri, and I will look forward to his correcting this error in that conference with the blessing, I believe, of our committee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts, and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and inquire how much time remains on my side.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Twelve minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400327" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York for the time and also for her leadership on this issue. I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, and I want to thank Chairman Frank for building on our work in the last Congress, bringing this bill up when I was a proud sponsor, original sponsor, with Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Blunt and Mr. Crowley of similar legislation that we passed in this House last Congress, and I am proud to be an original sponsor  of this legislation. This has been a bipartisan effort and model for the way Congress should operate all of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we now know and very few knew 18 months ago, CFIUS is charged with assessing the safety and security ramifications of direct foreign investment in the United States of America. The bill before us reforms CFIUS to strike the right balance between ensuring national security and open investment. 9/11 taught us that the number one priority of this government is to do all they can do to assure our citizens' security in their homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Dubai Ports World has left the front page and most people's minds, but it's not forgotten. Congress heard and responded to the immediate concerns voiced by Americans that we could not sell security at our ports at any price. Today, we pass a bill that returns accountability to a broken process, while ensuring job growth and investment in our economy are not collateral damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, the bill we are considering maintains that of the House bill that we introduced last March: increasing administration accountability for the scrutiny of foreign investment transaction; increasing congressional opportunities for oversight of that process; increasing predictability for businesses negotiating the CFIUS process; formalizing the Department of Homeland Security's role in CFIUS; and creating a formal role for the Director of National Intelligence in analyzing each proposed  transaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us requires that the Treasury Department and each agency directly involved in scrutinizing a transaction sign a certification that goes directly to the Congress. There's strong emphasis on analysis of every transaction by the Director of National Intelligence, and time is given for all members of the CFIUS committee to digest the analysis before making a decision on a transaction. National security is put first in this process. Nothing stands before  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be noted that the administration has radically overhauled the CFIUS process in the last 18 months  since the fiasco. This legislation is needed so there is no backsliding and no further letting down of our guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say we cannot wait any longer to enact this legislation. We must send a clear signal to our trading partners. There were concerns that some of the press reports on the reform process gave other Nations the impression that we were going to enact protectionist legislation instead of a bill that continued to welcome foreign investment, which also means domestic job growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trade does not take place in a vacuum. What we do here in the United States affects the environment available to U.S. companies expanding their global reach and the expansion of jobs here at home. Honda Motor Corporation alone has made a $6.3 billion investment in my home State of Ohio, employing over 8,500 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention this simply to say that we can't get to a point where foreign direct investment is a dirty phrase. The United States remains the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment but by a decreasing margin. China, which was just a blip on the screen 20 years ago, is now a major competitor for foreign investment dollars. In June, the Commerce Department reported that foreign direct investment into U.S. businesses rose 77 percent in 2006, compared with a year earlier, but remained  less than half their peak level in 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the United States is going to attract the ideas, the people, the capital and companies that will drive economic growth in the 21st century, we need a CFIUS process that protects national security but also keeps America an attractive and accessible place to do business and invest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the many members, the chairman and ranking member especially, who invested so much time and effort to get this process right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues who voted for this bill unanimously are as delighted as I am to see <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the CFIUS reform bill, once again on this floor, this time headed for the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strengthening the system of review of foreign direct investment in this country is, as this body has recognized repeatedly, an important national and strongly bipartisan interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Dubai Ports World matter became front page news a year and a half ago, most Americans had no idea that the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States existed or what it did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Dubai Ports World debacle made clear that the CFIUS process needed strengthening and oversight, both to ensure that foreign investment here does not jeopardize our national security in a post-9/11 world and to encourage and support safe foreign investment in this country to create jobs and boost our economy. This bill is designed to accomplish both of these important goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues will remember, one of the first bills passed by the Financial Services Committee in this Congress and brought to the floor was the original version of this legislation. I am delighted to say that the Senate adopted our bill with very few changes, and it is back here for final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This has been a long and consistently bipartisan effort in which several Members played key roles and deserve special recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to especially thank Chairman Frank and the Democratic leadership, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, for their support. They made this bill a priority and quickly moved it forward for passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Minority Whip Roy Blunt for his work, both in this Congress and in the last, in putting together a coalition to build support for CFIUS reform. Congressman Joe Crowley and Congressman Luis Gutierrez played a key role in that coalition, and I thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My former colleague on the Monetary Policy Subcommittee, Congresswoman Pryce of Ohio, worked with me to hold hearings on this bill in the last Congress. Those hearings built on the seminal report from the GAO on the weaknesses in the CFIUS process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Congressman Thompson of Mississippi and Congressman King of the Homeland Security Committee, who encouraged this bill from the start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank those Members' staff, particularly Scott Morris, Joe Pinder, Kevin Casey, Peter Freeman, Kyle Nehvins; my subcommittee staff director, Eleni Constantine and Ed Mills for their tireless work on this bill over the past 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the Senate for moving forward promptly on this key issue and for adopting our bill and our bill number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I thank Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby for their bipartisan work in moving this forward and their staffs for the careful dedication they gave to every detail of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to the thank Secretary Paulson, Deputy Secretary Kimmitt, Undersecretary Steel and Assistant Secretary Lowery. It is they and their successors who will ensure that the CFIUS process works under Congress's oversight. I have appreciated the dialogue we have had over the past 2 years on how the reforms we propose will be implemented, and in some cases, they already have been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is necessary now more than ever. As the Wall Street journal reported this week, a growing number of countries are imposing new restrictions on foreign investment that go well beyond the strict focus on national security concerns embodied in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story indicates that the new hostility to foreign acquirers reflects a perception that the United States is erecting new barriers to foreign capital. Today's legislation establishes in unequivocal terms that this perception is false.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By strengthening and clarifying the national security review process and maintaining a strict focus on national security, the CFIUS reforms embodied in <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> clearly endorse the open investment policy of the United States while enhancing our national security protections. In the name of national security, the President can intervene in any transaction, and, similarly, CFIUS can condition approval of a deal on being able to reopen a review. But this bill provides clarity and certainty for investors  by requiring a finding by CFIUS that all other remedies have been exhausted before CFIUS can reopen a review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that the certain and transparent CFIUS procedures in this bill stand in stark contrast to actions by some foreign governments where expropriations of assets have occurred arbitrarily without justification and without recompense for U.S. investors. By passing this bill, we continue our long-standing efforts to ensure that U.S. investors are treated with the same certainty and fairness in foreign markets as we give foreign investors in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes several necessary reforms. First, it creates CFIUS by statute, so that its operations, membership and procedures have a sound basis in law, and we are reviewable by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it requires a full 45-day investigation of foreign government investment, in addition to the 30-day review, which can only be waived by the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary of Treasury. While many foreign governments' transactions are harmless, they also pose certain inherent risks. Governments have more assets and resources than private sector participants and may have nonmarket motives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it requires review and sign-off on every transaction, by a high-level official. When the Ports World deal became public, no senior official could be found who knew about the approval before it happened. The House bill required all approvals to be made by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary. The Senate bill allows a Deputy Secretary to make a decision, but it also mandates the creation of a special assistant secretary at Treasury whose portfolio would be CFIUS matters. By restricting the  additional decision-making ability to one out of the many assistant secretaries at the Treasury, this preserves the accountability and high-level review that motivated the original delegation provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the bill requires reporting to Congress after the conclusion of reviews. While we do not want to politicize the process of security review, we also want to assure proper oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, it creates and places and puts in place the importance of review by the National Intelligence Director.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six, it requires tracking of transactions that are withdrawn from the process. Since deals are often withdrawn because they hit a snag in the initial course of review, it is necessary to make sure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent whatever potential risk was spotted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, this was the case with a Smartmatic transaction that I brought to the attention of Treasury last summer as a matter requiring CFIUS review. As you may recall, press reports indicated that Smartmatic, which had just bought the second largest voting machine company in the United States, Sequoia Voting Systems, had ties to the Venezuelan government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought those allegations needed to be investigated by the body with the power to really get into the tangled ownership of the company, which is CFIUS. Under the broad and flexible definition of national security that the bill puts in place, certainly the ownership of voting machines is a potential national security issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A CFIUS review began of the deal. But before it was completed, Smartmatic withdrew and agreed to sell Sequoia. Certainly, this is an agreement that I would want CFIUS to track and make sure actually was followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have struck the right balance in this bill in protecting the national security interests of our country, first and foremost, but also providing a certain and clear procedure to encourage safe foreign investment that will create jobs and boost the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to once again give this bill their unequivocal support and send it to the President with a bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400327" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to my colleague and good friend from the State of California, the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Hunter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400191" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague for yielding me some time and for the good work that she has done on this bill, as well as my good friend from New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I oppose this bill for this reason: We passed out what I think was a pretty good bill out of the House. That bill had in it several critical national security elements. One of those elements was that any member of this committee, of the CFIUS committee, including, for example, the Secretary of Defense, or a leader in another agency, could, by a single vote, trigger an investigation if they thought there was a national security problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember, this bill grew out of the Dubai Ports problem. When we were faced with this takeover of our port operations in a number of key ports by a foreign-owned company, we realized that that company could access information about vulnerable aspects of those particular ports that could, at some point, be utilized in a terrorist activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we understood, and that was a good illustration of how critical this CFIUS process is, especially with this array of foreign investments taking place in this country. So we understood that we needed to reform CFIUS. In those days, during the Dubai Ports problem, before that, you had an arrangement that was largely put together by Presidential directive, and the President, by his directive, gave any member of the CFIUS committee, including SecDef, the ability to raise their hand and basically  say, I want an investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we ensured that, as we put this thing together in statute, that we maintained that right. I am turning to the House-passed provision that we passed, that I supported. It talked about an investigation being triggered by a roll call vote, and I am quoting, a roll call vote pursuant to paragraph 3(a) in connection with a review under paragraph 1 of any covered transaction results in at least one vote by a committee member against approving the transaction, meaning that the Secretary of Defense  could get up and say, I think there is a problem here, and he could trigger that transaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the product that came back from the Senate didn't have that provision. It had this provision; it said that an investigation would be triggered if "the lead agency recommends and the committee concurs that an investigation be undertaken." They have clearly watered down the ability of one person, for example, the Secretary of Defense, to say, to trigger an investigation upon his demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that's a fatal flaw, because that takes us back to a weaker position than what we have had under the current practice, which involves an investigation being undertaken if a single member of the committee objects under the present Presidential directive. We are actually going back to a lower standard for triggering an investigation than we had before the Dubai ports problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think, unfortunately, we have taken a product from the Senate which is fatally flawed in that respect. I would strongly support this provision coming back, this exact same law, coming back with that fix. But I don't know any way we can fix it, or even with a colloquy or in any other way, assign a new congressional intent that will clearly reflect that the words that have been changed aren't, in fact, controlling at this point, but that there is a congressional intent that controls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I have to object to the passage of this bill, and I will not support the passage of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's hard work on this bill and his statements, but I would like to clarify that CFIUS is a consensus body, so each member does and will continue to have an effective veto. This bill does not affect that ability in any way. Chairman Frank of the committee made that very clear in his statements in committee and on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of important organizations in our country, including the Chamber of Commerce, that have issued letters and statements in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: On behalf of the Financial Services Forum, a trade association comprised of the CEOs of 20 of the largest and most diversified financial institutions, I write in strong support of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the "Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007." This bipartisan legislation would ensure that proposed foreign investments in the U.S. meet national security objectives while preserving an open, fair and non-discriminatory investment  environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this bill indicates to international investors and trade partners that the U.S. remains open for foreign investment and signals to other countries that they should follow suit by keeping their doors open to U.S. foreign direct investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Forum believes that the legislation strikes the appropriate balance between keeping Americans safe and growing the economy. The included reforms make clear that every Administration will devote time and resources to foreign investment deals that require higher levels of scrutiny, while allowing acquisitions that do not present national security concerns to move forward swiftly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign direct investment supports employment for over 5 million Americans, who typically earn compensation well above the national average. Investment from abroad supports 19% of all U.S. exports. In 2005, a number of foreign-owned companies reinvested $59 billion in profits back into the U.S. economy. At a time when the competitiveness of the United States is so important, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> will help maintain  America's global advantage and grow the U.S. economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Forum applauds the bipartisan leaders who worked swiftly and productively to move this bill. <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> will restore Congressional confidence in the CFIUS process and the Forum urges Members to support this critically important bipartisan bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESSIONAL AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and region, strongly supports <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the "National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007," which is expected to be considered by the House under suspension of the rules tomorrow. This bipartisan bill would make certain that the process  for vetting proposed foreign investments in the  U.S. meets national security objectives while preserving an open, fair, and non-discriminatory investment environment. Passage of this bill sends the right signals to international investors: that the U.S. is open for foreign investment and that the nation's trade competitors should follow suit and keep their doors open to U.S. foreign direct investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chamber believes that <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> strikes the appropriate balance between keeping Americans safe and protecting the economy. The proposed reforms to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) make clear that the administration has the flexibility to devote time and resources on foreign investment deals that require the most attention to national security concerns, while allowing acquisitions that do not present any national security concerns to move forward without impediment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign direct investment supports employment for 5.1 million Americans, who typically earn compensation well above the national average. Investment from abroad supports 19% of all U.S. exports. In 2005, a number of foreign-owned companies reinvested $59 billion in profits back into the U.S. economy. Clearly, this bill will help maintain America's competitive edge and continue to contribute positively to the U.S. economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chamber applauds the bipartisan effort that resulted in the completion of this bill. <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> will restore congressional confidence in the CFIUS process. The Chamber urges the House to support this critical bipartisan bill with a strong affirmative vote. The Chamber will consider using votes on, or in relation to, this issue in our annual How They Voted scorecard.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400327" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no other requests for time. Let me close by addressing the concerns of my colleague that were just raised. The reforms in many areas of this bill far outweigh the compromise of the committee machinations that were made over in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Believe me, it is no small point, and it is one not lost on me. Our product, I believe, is far superior. The Senate's, as the gentleman points out, is weaker than ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I believe that the colloquy between Chairman Frank and Chairman Skelton will help us resolve that. Chairman Frank says it is the intent of this Congress that there is a consensus on the CFIUS, and he agreed to work with Chairman Skelton and the Defense Authorization Act to correct this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But taken as a whole, this bill is far superior than current law. It must be enacted, and the sooner the better. Let me reiterate, the rest of the world is watching us here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are passing a balanced bill that does not forget the importance of FDI to our economy, but it protects our ports and our homeland to the extent that this Congress is able to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we must act quickly. We have been stymied for a year now. We can't afford to send the wrong message. It means that American jobs will be lost, and we will be no safer for prolonging this process. This bill protects our economy, but also the ultimate protection is to our homeland. I urge passage of this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I fully support <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greater oversight is needed regarding foreign investment in the United States, and I want to commend Chairman Frank and Mrs. Maloney for the work they have done in bringing about this legislation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs has significant jurisdictional interest in this legislation, and I was very pleased at the manner in which our committees have worked on <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> as it moved through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to call attention to two critical issues. First, the treatment that the United States provides to foreign investors is often not reciprocated to United States companies who wish to invest in foreign markets, which threatens bilateral investment relations. The procedures laid out in this bill for the interagency Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, allow for a responsible and fair assessment of foreign direct investment into the United States. These  procedures, however, stand in stark contrast to actions taken by some foreign governments, where expropriations of assets, often in the energy sector, have occurred arbitrarily, without justification, and without full and fair compensation for United States investors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must continue to seek to ensure that U.S. investors are treated fairly in foreign markets, especially when a transaction being evaluated by CFIUS is for a company whose primary place of business is in a country that does not allow foreign direct investment from the United States in the same business sector as that of the covered transaction. In this way, we can seek to ensure that foreign governments honor their commitments in international agreements and provide for a fair and  friendly investment climate for United States companies. I am pleased that the gentlelady from New York agrees with me on this score and that the House reports accompanying <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> address this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the impact of foreign investments on national security must be considered when reviewing foreign investments into the United States. I am pleased that the Financial Services Committee recognizes the seriousness of how transactions reviewed by CFIUS can impact our national security. The Committee report on <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> makes clear that Congress expects the acquisitions of U.S. companies, including energy assets, by foreign governments or companies controlled by foreign governments, will be  reviewed closely for their national security impact. I fully endorse this view and believe that the United States must remain vigilant in protecting our national security interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the "Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007". As our Nation pursues the laudable dual goals of free and fair flows of capital and trade in the global economy, it must remain ever vigilant of its own security. Understanding this, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> amends existing law to strengthen the process by which the Federal Government performs national security-related reviews of foreign investments in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, this bill establishes in statute the membership of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> broadens the factors that CFIUS must consider during reviews of proposed foreign investments in the United States. This includes the bill's express intent that critical energy infrastructure-related aspects of national security not be ignored in the CFIUS review process. I am particularly pleased with this provision, as well as the establishment in the  bill of adding both the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce as permanent members of CFIUS. In short, the Committee on Energy and Commerce appreciates the emphasis laid by the bill on issues that fall squarely within our jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I note my support for the bill's requirement that the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury investigate why that Department has not complied with reporting requirements related to potential industrial espionage or coordinated strategies by foreign parties with respect to U.S. critical technology, as is required under current law. This underscores my strong belief that Congressional oversight is a necessary component in assuring that the laws are properly and thoroughly carried  out by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have concerns regarding what I believe are several shortcomings in <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, when compared to the bill originally passed by the House in February of this year. I am troubled that there is no provision to designate vice chairmen of CFIUS--which, in the bill originally passed by the House, would have been comprised of the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security--and instead replaces it with "lead agencies," to which the responsibility for performing national security reviews would  now mainly be delegated. This has the lamentable consequence of hindering the thorough participation of the Department of Commerce in the CFIUS review process, something for which my colleagues on the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy and Commerce advocated during their hearing on CFIUS reform in July 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> now contains weaker provisions related to the collection of evidence in national security reviews, the approval of such reviews, as well as reporting requirements to the Congress about them. For example, while <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> originally directed CFIUS to submit reports to the Congress on all actions related to covered transactions, the bill now only provides for reports to be submitted to the Congress upon request. Also, I am alarmed that <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> no longer protects the Federal  Government from liability for losses incurred by parties during CFIUS reviews. Such an omission may dissuade the Government from prosecuting thorough reviews for fear of being sued for remuneration by parties to CFIUS-covered transactions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I have chided the bill for what I perceive to be its most apparent weaknesses, I have always maintained that the desire for perfect legislation should not impede the progress of good legislation. I believe <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> is good legislation that will contribute to the improvement of the CFIUS. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as Chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security in support of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. This bill provides necessary reform by formalizing and streamlining the structure and duties of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. This reform combines an understanding of the need for ensuring that foreign investment in the U.S. is  in the security interests of the American public with an appreciation for global commerce in the 21st century. Indeed, this bill addresses many of the concerns raised about CFIUS over the past year, especially with regard to its current lack of transparency and oversight. This bill rectifies these concerns by formally</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill formalizes the CFIUS membership and requires the following to serve: (1) Secretaries of Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, State, and Energy; (2) Attorney General; Director of National Intelligence (ex officio); and Secretary of Labor (ex officio); and (3) The heads of any other executive department, agency, or office, as the President determines appropriate, generally on a case-by-case basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, CFIUS will conduct a review of any transaction by or with any foreign person which could result in the foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the U.S. to determine the effects of the transaction on the national security of the U.S. CFIUS will determine whether to conduct an investigation of the effects of the transaction on the national security of the U.S. if the initial review of the transaction results in the determination that: The transaction threatens  to impair the national security of the U.S. and that the threat has not been mitigated during or prior to the review of the transaction; the transaction is a foreign government-controlled transaction; the transaction would result in control of any critical</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lead agency recommends, and CFIUS concurs, that an investigation be undertaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe that our colleagues in the Senate made remarkable contributions to this bill. For example, I think that its determination to eliminate the option for CFIUS to conduct a second 45-day review at the end of the investigation stage was a wise one. As a result of this change, CFIUS will be required to be efficient and will demonstrate our country's recognition of the importance of not hampering foreign investment that avoids hindering our national security. The Congressional  Research Service's independent report, for instance, found that, for all the merger and acquisition activity in 2005, 13 percent of it was from foreign firms acquiring U.S. firms. This is up from 9 percent nearly 10 years before. This statistic shows that foreign investment in the U.S. is vital to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must mention, however, my concern with one of the changes to the bill, as passed by my colleagues in the Senate, which eliminates an important role of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Both bills establish the Secretary of the Treasury as the Chairperson of CFIUS. Whereas the original House-passed bill required that the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Commerce be Vice Chairpersons of CFIUS, the current bill eliminates the Vice Chairpersons and, instead, calls for the Secretary of the  Treasury to designate, as appropriate, a member or members of CFIUS to be the "lead agency or agencies" on behalf of CFIUS for each covered transaction, and for negotiating any mitigation agreements or other conditions necessary to protect national security. In addition, the lead agency or agencies will work on all matters</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has played a vital role with regard to CFIUS cases in the past and has an unparalleled institutional understanding of such cases. In its involvement with such cases, it represents the need to protect our homeland from attack and to ensure that our critical infrastructure is protected and available to the American public during, and in the aftermath of, an attack. In 2006, the Department was involved in each of the 113 CFIUS filings and, in 15 instances, the  Department requested mitigation agreements. Thus far in 2007, the Department has been involved in each of the 80 filings and has requested five mitigation agreements. Furthermore, a large number of these filings regard the ownership of critical infrastructure, which is a major initiative of the Department. The Department's past involvement with CFIUS and its mission to protect our country only underscores its need to be second to none when CFIUS reviews cases. That the Department no longer has a clearly articulated leadership</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, nevertheless, brings the necessary reform to the CFIUS process. Incidents such as Dubai Ports World and China National Offshore Oil Corporation's attempted bid for control of an oil company, Unocal, raised an increased awareness regarding transactions that should receive CFIUS review. Importantly, though, this bill does not represent an isolationist reaction to these incidents but, instead, balances the need for continued foreign investment in the U.S. with the need to review that  investment's impact on national security and our critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only through this legislation will CFIUS have a formal budget, membership, and a clear mission--protecting American security while maintaining a free and growing economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me thank my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this legislation, especially my Democratic colleagues Chairman FRANK as well as Representative CAROLYN MALONEY and Representative JOSEPH CROWLEY  of New York. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation with strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to express the support of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in particular the Subcommittee for Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, for <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the "Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007." This bill makes much-needed reforms to the process by which the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, hereafter: CFIUS, performs national security-related reviews of potential foreign investments in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the DB World scandal, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has been actively involved in efforts to reform CFIUS. Along with the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on (then) International Relations, our Committee received referral of <bill type="h" number="5337">H.R. 5337</bill>, the "National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2006," in May 2006. Following a hearing by the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection on <bill type="h" number="5337">H.R. 5337</bill> in July 2006, the Committee  on Energy and Commerce ordered the bill reported. While <bill type="h" number="5337">H.R. 5337</bill> was approved by the House, the Senate did not take it up before the conclusion of the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of this year, the Committee on Energy and Commerce again received referral of a CFIUS reform bill, this time <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the "National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Transparency Act of 2007." In the interest of expediting House passage of this bill, our Committee agreed to waive its right to mark up <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, provided that the final bill include provisions for the establishment of a vice chairmanship of CFIUS, additional CFIUS reporting requirements to the Congress, and that  the Inspector General of the Treasury Department investigate that Department's failure to report on potential industrial espionage or coordinated strategies by foreign countries with respect to U.S. critical technology. This understanding--intended for the express purpose</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given our jurisdictional stake and strong interest in CFIUS reform, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is pleased that the House will vote today on <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>. This bill is the culmination of over a year's effort to improve the process by which our government reviews potential foreign investment in the United States for national security risks. While my Committee does offer its support of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, we would note that our support is tempered by concerns with deficiencies in the Senate amendments  to the bill. My good friend and colleague, Chairman DINGELL, discusses these concerns in greater detail in a statement which has been inserted into the Record. Given this, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection fully intends</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that we are this point in the legislative process to send to the President's desk a bipartisan, bicameral reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, process. I first became interested in CFIUS reform when a Chinese state-owned enterprise was in competition with a private Italian and a Canadian firm to purchase a very sensitive machine tool division of Ingersoll Milling. The Chinese eventually decided not to attempt  to buy the very sensitive machine tool division of Ingersoll but were able to purchase the non-sensitive production line division, which saved hundreds of jobs. It came up again when IBM decided to sell its personal computer division to Lenovo, partially owned by the Chinese government. It emerged again when the China National Offshore Oil Company, CNOOC, another Chinese state-owned enterprise, was ready to outbid a private firm to acquire Unocal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me make clear that I am a strong supporter of foreign direct investment into the United States. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies employ 5.1 million Americans, of which 31 percent are in the manufacturing sector; have a payroll of $325 billion; and account for 19 percent of all U.S. exported goods. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is important because in many cases it provides capital to purchase companies in the U.S. where there is no domestic financing or interest, thus saving  thousands of U.S. jobs. Many foreign companies retained numerous firms and jobs in the northern Illinois district I am proud to represent including Ingersoll Machine Milling (Italy) and Ingersoll Cutting Tools (Israel) in Rockford; Nissan Forklift (Japan) in Marengo; Eisenmann Corporation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House is now prepared to send a comprehensive CFIUS reform bill to the President because of the legitimate concern over a year ago of Dubai Ports (DP) World's proposed acquisition of the London-based Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O) management operations of 27 terminals at 6 major U.S. ports east of the Mississippi River. Many Americans were legitimately concerned about the national security implications of this deal. However, it was often overlooked that DP World is  a state-owned enterprise, owned by the royal family of Dubai. What does it mean for our national interest when foreign governments acquire private sector companies in America?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the P&amp;O case, the New York Times reported on February 24, 2006 that this sale came down to a "battle between two foreign, state-backed companies"--DP World and PSA, which is part of the investment arm of the Singapore government. "The acquisition price (for P&amp;O) reflects the advantage that a number of the fastest growing companies enjoy--their government's deep pockets." Here is the key, Mr. Speaker--"DP World paid about 20 percent more (for P&amp;O) than analysts thought the company was  worth. Publicly traded companies that were potential bidders were scared off long before DP World's final offer."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You would think this would be a factor in the CFIUS decisionmaking process, particularly after Congress in 1992 required a 45-day review process for acquisitions by state-owned enterprises in reaction to the proposed sale of LTV's missile division to Thomson-CSF, the American subsidiary of a French firm that was then 58 percent owned by the French Government. Yet, CFIUS initially declined to subject the DP World's proposed acquisition of P&amp;O through the additional 45-day review process until  pressured by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> incorporates my main suggestion to mandate all proposed acquisitions of U.S. assets by a foreign state-owned enterprise undergo the more rigorous additional 45-day review process. The free market cannot work if foreign governments subsidize the purchase of U.S. assets. <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> will make absolutely crystal clear that in every case where there is a proposed acquisition by a foreign state-owned enterprise, it will undergo heightened scrutiny to ensure that there is no  hidden agenda by a foreign government that could undermine our national security. We owe it to our constituents to make sure that foreign governments do not undermine our open free market system as a tool to advance their national interests. I congratulate the Chairmen and Ranking Members in both Houses of Congress for working together to produce a bill that will merit the President's signature. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, I am pleased we are considering the Senate amendment to this legislation, which passed the House earlier this Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. This legislation will require congressional notification for cases sent to second-stage reviews and automatically subjects all transactions involving foreign state-owned companies to a second-stage 45-day investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the attempt by Dubai Ports World, a port operations company owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates, to purchase operating terminals at 6 U.S. ports was a clear indicator the CFIUS process was in dire need of reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever a foreign investment affects our homeland security, it deserves greater scrutiny. It seems to me this legislation strikes the proper balance between strengthening our economy and protecting the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and move this bill to the President for his signature.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support, and as a proud co-sponsor of <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the bipartisan National Security FIRST Act of 2007. This bill will ensure that never again will the Congress and people of the United States be taken by surprise at the discovery that an administration may have endangered the nation's security by authorizing the acquisition of critical American infrastructure by an entity owned or controlled by foreign government with interests inimical  to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, recall how outraged Americans were in January 2006 when we learned of the Bush administration's secret approval of the Dubai Ports World deal. That is when it was disclosed that the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had approved a port deal sought by Dubai Ports World--with only minimal review--despite the deal's national security implications. Dubai Ports World is a company owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Dubai port deal would have resulted in the company managing terminal operations at six major U.S. ports, including the Port of Houston in my own congressional district. But that is not all. As the facts began to dribble out, we learned that the CFIUS had not initiated a 45-day national security investigation--despite the fact that UAE had links to 9/11 and notwithstanding the fact the Department of Homeland Security had raised security concerns. It was only in response to the overwhelming  disapproval, criticism, and anger of the American people and the Congress that Dubai Ports World announced in early March 2006 that it was divesting itself of these U.S. port operations, effectively killing the deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, although this was a happy outcome it did not obscure the material fact that the CFIUS process was fundamentally flawed. This is because despite the national security implications, the Bush administration lawfully had approved the Dubai Ports World deal with only minimal review--and with no notification to the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also clear from the record that the Bush administration only gave the Dubai port deal a cursory look before approving it. The secretive CFIUS approved the plan with little review, in only 30 days, and without the 45-day national security investigation that should have been conducted. Further, the CFIUS approval was made by mid-level officials. The senior-level decisionmakers in the administration--including the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President  of the United States--were not involved in the decisionmaking process and learned of it only from media reports. In addition, no Member of Congress was informed of the secretive approval by CFIUS of the port deal--with Members also learning about the deal in press reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I participated in hearings that uncovered the  weaknesses in the CFIUS regulatory framework and cosponsored bipartisan legislation in the 109th Congress that would have corrected these deficiencies. That bill, <bill type="h" number="5337">H.R. 5337</bill>, passed the House 424-0 but the Republican congressional leadership in the last Congress could not get together with the Senate to produce and present to the President a bill he would sign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We rectify that failure today. <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> strengthens national security by reforming the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) process by which the Federal Government reviews foreign investments in the United States for their national security implications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires CFIUS to conduct a 30-day review of any national security-related business transaction. After a 30-day review is conducted, CFIUS would be required to conduct a full-scale, 45-day investigation of the effects the business transaction would have on national security if the committee review determines that the transaction threatens to impair national security and these threats have not been mitigated during the 30-day review. The statutory 45-day review is also triggered if the  committee review determines that the transaction involves a foreign government-controlled entity and the CFIUS chairman and  vice chairman are unable to certify it poses no threat to the national security. Finally, the 45-day review is required if the Director</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> for four important reasons. First, it subjects transactions involving foreign governments to a stricter level of scrutiny. Second, the bill provides for senior-level accountability for CFIUS decisions. Third, the bill improves CFIUS accountability to Congress. Finally, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> strengthens the CFIUS review process by establishing a formal role for intelligence assessments for every transaction. I will briefly discuss each of these important procedural improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I indicated earlier, the Dubai Ports World deal was approved by mid-level officials and without a 45-day national security investigation of the transaction, even though Dubai Ports World was owned by a foreign government. <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> strengthens current law by requiring in cases involving a company that is controlled by a foreign government, a non-delegable certification by either (1) the chairman of CFIUS (the Secretary of the Treasury) or the vice-chairman of CFIUS (the Secretary  of Homeland Security) that the transaction poses no national security threat. In the absence of this non-delegable certification, a second-stage 45-day national security investigation of the transaction must take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> ensures senior level accountability for CFIUS decisions by requiring the chairman and vice chairman of CFIUS to approve all transactions where CFIUS consideration is completed within the 30-day review period (limiting delegation of approval authority to the Under Secretary level); and requires that the President approve all transactions that have also been subjected to the second-stage 45-day national security investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> improves CFIUS accountability to Congress. As was noted above, Members of Congress were not notified of the CFIUS approval of the Dubai Ports World deal. This bill rectifies this failure by requiring CFIUS to report to the congressional committees of jurisdiction within 5 days after the final action on a CFIUS investigation, and permits the committees to request one detailed classified briefing on the transaction. The bill also requires CFIUS to file semi-annual reports to Congress that  contain information on transactions handled by the committee during the previous 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> strengthens the CFIUS review process by establishing a formal role for intelligence assessments for every transaction. The bill requires that every transaction be subjected to an assessment by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and contains provisions to ensure that the DNI has adequate time to conduct the required assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All in all, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill> represents an important contribution to our effort to secure the homeland. Last November, the American people voted for change, they voted for competence, they voted for a new direction for our country. I am proud to say that with <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>, the new majority has once again delivered on its promise to chart a new direction to make America safer and more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="556">H.R. 556</bill>.</paragraph>
