  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to say a few brief words about the Reverend Jerry Falwell, who passed away earlier today at the age of 73.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have personally known Reverend Falwell since I first ran for election to the U.S. Senate in 1978. And, since that time, I have come to befriend a man who in many ways became a pillar of strength and inspiration not only to his community of Lynchburg, VA, where he was born but indeed to people around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the 28-plus years that I have had the good fortune of representing the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. Senate, Reverend Falwell was always a constituent of mine, and he would often offer his counsel to me about pressing matters of the day. He would always do so in a polite, yet firm manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I might not have always agreed with him, I have always admired Reverend Falwell, particularly for his unwavering commitment to what he thought was right. Jerry Falwell never ran from controversy, and he always stuck to his beliefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, I believe it was the firmness of his convictions that, in part, allowed Jerry Falwell to achieve so much success in whatever he undertook in life. He was an intensely driven man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 22 he started a Baptist church in Lynchburg, VA, with 35 members. Reportedly, on the first Sunday his congregation met in 1956, the first offering totaled $135. Today, that same church has upwards of 24,000 members and annual revenues of all of his ministries total over $200 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1971, Jerry Falwell founded Liberty University--a liberal arts, Christian institution of higher education. Today, Liberty University employs more than 1,000 Virginians and educates more than 20,000 students a year either on its campus or through distance learning programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, the thousands and thousands of students who Liberty has educated these many years will undoubtedly be one part of Reverend Falwell's strong legacy that will last for generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers today go out to the Falwell family, including his beloved wife of nearly 50 years, and his three children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am up, I wonder if I could indicate to the managers that I intend to  file an amendment tonight along the lines established by the distinguished majority leader regarding amendments to be considered on this bill which relate to the appropriations bill now being formulated to provide for the funds for the troops. I think it is the wisdom of the two leaders jointly that on this bill those Senators who wish to have language attached to any appropriations  bill would make known their desires through adding an amendment on this bill. Cloture will be filed on such amendments for tomorrow. If my amendment is selected by the Republican leader, then I understand it would be subject to a cloture vote tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and thank the managers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support Senator Kerry's amendment to the Water Resources Development Act. This amendment is quite simple, and if enacted, would contribute to the modernization of the Army Corps of Engineers, something I have been fighting for for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kerry-Feingold amendment would require the Corps to account for the potential long and short term effects of global climate change when planning projects. This commonsense amendment is vital for safeguarding communities and the environment since virtually every water resource project designed and built by the Corps sits on the front lines of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All Corps projects are going to feel the strain, the impact, and the consequences of global warming. This is true whether we are talking about ensuring that flood damage reduction projects will in fact provide communities with the promised levels of protection; ensuring that port projects take climate change into account for emergency preparedness purposes; or ensuring that ecosystem restoration projects are properly designed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with many of my colleagues, I believe it is essential to take bold steps to address global climate change. Senators Sanders and Boxer are leading the most comprehensive, scientifically based global warming pollutant bill to address the emission of carbon dioxide. I am proud to cosponsor that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kerry-Feingold amendment does not address the emissions of global warming, but rather simply makes sure that future water resources projects take into account the effects of global warming. There are a lot of necessary policy changes needed to respond to global warming and we need to move forward on all fronts. This proposed amendment should gain broad bipartisan support, even from those who remain unsure of the best approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and even from those who remain  skeptical about the causes of global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment ensures that Corps of Engineers projects will take into account the impacts of climate change, regardless of its cause. It also ensures that the Corps will take more aggressive steps to protect natural systems that can help buffer the impacts of climate change and that provide a host of other vital benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scientists clearly agree that the climate is changing. They also agree that, as a result of that change, we can expect an increase in extreme weather events. A recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expresses this consensus. Climate scientists agree that global warming will cause stronger storms, more frequent floods, increased sea level, and extended droughts. This report concludes, among other things, that: Climate change will lead to more intense storms and increasing  sea levels, particularly along the gulf and Atlantic coasts, which will pose significant risks to coastal communities from storm surges and flooding; climate change will lead to more flooding in the winter and early spring due to earlier snowmelt and increased</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Scientific Expert Group on Climate Change to the United Nations also recently concluded that human health "will be threatened" by the global climate change-induced increases in the intensity and frequency of storms, floods, droughts, and heat-related mortality. These changes will clearly complicate water resource planning for the foreseeable future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also know that there are ways to buffer the effects of these changes. Healthy rivers, streams, floodplains, and wetlands reduce the impacts of flooding by acting as natural sponges and basins, absorbing flood waters, and releasing them slowly over time. Coastal wetlands provide vital barriers between storm surges and communities. When these wetlands are lost, coastal communities are far more vulnerable to disaster, as we saw so tragically during Hurricane Katrina. Healthy streams and wetlands  also help minimize the impacts of drought by recharging groundwater supplies and filtering pollutants from drinking water. And all of these resources provide critical habitat for fish and wildlife, and important recreational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even without global climate change, it is imperative that we take a more aggressive approach to accounting for and protecting these resources that are so essential for the Nation's health, safety, economic prosperity, and well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not have to peer into a crystal ball to see the dangers of allowing the Corps to continue to plan projects without accounting for the changes that will be wrought by climate change. The Nation bore witness to those dangers when Hurricane Katrina slammed into the gulf coast. The devastation of New Orleans is a horrific example of the tragic consequences of an intense storm hitting a region where Corps projects have destroyed vital natural wetland buffers and have not properly accounted for  the risk of severe storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment requires the Corps to immediately begin to address these types of issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment would require the Corps to utilize the best available climate science in assessing flood and storm risks. This seems like plain common sense to me, but as we have sadly witnessed again and again, common sense does not always guide the Corps and its decisionmaking processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment would require the Corps to more fully account for the value of the services provided by healthy rivers, streams, wetlands, and floodplains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of special importance to me, our amendment also builds on existing law and policy to require the Corps to use nonstructural approaches, where appropriate, in project planning. This is critical for ensuring the best possible protection for those natural systems that are so important for our current and future health, safety, and welfare. While the Corps is currently required to consider nonstructural approaches, it rarely recommends them. This is true even when nonstructural approaches would provide  the same or better project benefits while avoiding damages to these vital resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision would not--let me say this again, it would not--prevent the Corps from using structural approaches like levees and floodwalls where they are needed. But it would require the Corps to be more aggressive in its efforts to utilize natural systems that on their own provide vital flood protection and water quality benefits. And it would also help the Corps overcome what the Department of the Army inspector general concluded was an "institutional bias" for constructing costly, large  scale structural projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can no longer rely on the status quo to protect our future. We can no longer rely solely on the Corps' traditional approaches to water projects. These approaches have too often severed critical connections between rivers and their wetlands and floodplains, and produced unanticipated wetland and floodplain losses. These approaches have left coastal communities, like New Orleans, far more vulnerable. These approaches have exacerbated flood damages by inducing development in high risk, flood  prone areas and by increasing downstream flooding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will change the status quo by removing blinders that have  plagued water resources planning for too long. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment and the commonsense changes it would bring about.</paragraph>

  <chair> Who yields time?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what is the time allocation at this point? How much time remains?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts controls 9 minutes 9 seconds. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 5 minutes 58 seconds.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. President, I will try to speed up and use such time as I may use quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, let me respond very quickly to some of the assertions that have been made. I want to try to get back to the bigger picture, but I will be very specific about a couple things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I never have suggested, nor have I heard anybody who has argued in favor of actions suggesting, there would be no cost, which is the term the Senator from Oklahoma used. We are not talking about no cost. We are talking about relative costs. It is clear from all the best analyses of every economic model that the costs of not acting are much greater than the costs of acting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That has become true, we have seen, in what has happened with respect to damages, migrations of species, other things that are already occurring and being observed as a result of the warming that is taking place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, I still say to my colleague from Oklahoma, despite the scientists he quotes, he still cannot produce one peer-reviewed study that says global climate change is not happening as a consequence of human activity. He cannot produce one peer-reviewed report that does not say it is happening, period--not one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So he can come in with a report that says some little thing here, some little thing there, but that does not go to the fundamental question of who is causing what.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier in this debate, they have a fundamental responsibility, if they are going to stand up and say to Americans we do not need to do anything; and that responsibility is to answer what is causing the warming if it is not the human-induced activity; and, secondly, how can the human activity that is being created not be doing what the scientists allege it is doing. On both counts, they have never, ever had a sufficient scientific explanation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, again, I would point out--I did earlier; the Senator was not here--as to the so-called SPM, as it is called, the policymaker's summary, there is a list on the first page of that summary, and all the people who wrote it are scientists. They are the ones who put that report together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is a point where you can sort of be debating all the red herrings here, which is not what is important. What is important in the end is that the consensus, globally, of leaders, of scientists, is clear about what is happening and why it is happening, No. 1. No. 2, what we are trying to do is not even respond to that, even though I believe we ought to be; we are simply trying to guarantee there is an adequate level of congressionally mandated--not voluntary but congressionally mandated--review  with respect to this in the activities of the Corps of Engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that climate change, obviously, relates to risk-based analysis. There are many climate change events that are taking place, all of which could affect the reliability of Corps projects. In this bill there is a program for ecosystem restoration in the Louisiana coastal area. Key is going to be ultimately developing a strategy for restoration that understands what happens with respect to coastal erosion and sea level rise. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet in Louisiana, right along the  coast, is dependent on storm surge information, hurricane prediction, sea level rise. Virtually every single beach replenishment project--what good is it going to do to replenish beaches in certain ways if the sea level is going to be rising and the intensity of those storms may increase?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to that, I would say to my friend from Oklahoma, the prediction was there would be more named storms, more hurricanes, and indeed there were more named storms. The level of predictions of storms was met, they just did not hit the United States. We lucked out. But the total numbers, in fact, were high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you can play with these possibilities. You can ignore science, if you choose to. But I think responsible legislation at this point, given the scientists and the level of information we have, requires us to act, and this is one very small way to act responsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, here we go again. This is exactly the same thing. If I responded to everything he said then, I have already done it before. I have read and I have talked about this. I have more scientists, if anyone wants to hear from more scientists. Also, as far as peer-reviewed studies, I have documented it, I have said where they are. So I can just say that so many times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is what I would suggest: What we are talking about is an amendment to this bill, an amendment to the bill which addresses the Corps of Engineers and asks them to report to us on every project, from this point forward, certain types of things, and it describes what they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a hearing the other day, I say to my good friend from Massachusetts. It was May 11, 2007. That was, what, last week. We have had John Paul Woodley, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a quote from his testimony. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Army Corps of Engineers has the capacity and necessary authorities to comprehensively examine the uncertainties, threats and vulnerabilities on water infrastructure and to implement the necessary adjustments as part of a proactive adaptive management program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They can do it now. They can do it. This is the head of the Corps of Engineers. So they do not need this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I wish to say this. We were supposed to have this vote at 5:30. It is now 10 after 6. I am prepared not to  say anything else and to yield back the remainder of my time, if the Senator from Massachusetts will do the same thing.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator a question, if I may.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>On your time, go ahead.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>On my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator said he had a whole lot of peer-reviewed studies. I would ask the Senator a simple question: Does he have one peer-reviewed study that says conclusively global climate change is not happening as a consequence of human activity, and, No. 2, that it is not happening. Does he have a peer-reviewed study that says that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me respond to that question. Of course I do not have that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is what I said.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>But I do have peer-reviewed studies that say specifically the amount of change that is attributable to human activity is so small it is not measurable, like .07 of 1 degree in 50 years. Now, that is significant. I have several peer-reviewed studies. I would be glad to respond to your question by reading those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a peer-reviewed study published in the April 18, 2007, issue of the science journal Geophysical Research Letters, which found that if the world continues to warm, vertical wind shear--which literally tears apart storms--will also rise. These winds will decrease the number and severity of storms we would otherwise have.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I interrupt my friend from Oklahoma and reclaim my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have approximately 20 peer-reviewed studies.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts controls the time at this point.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, again, the Senator is making my point. I conceded there are studies that will assert there is some change of a variation of what may or may not be happening but none that suggests it is not happening as a result of our activity or that it is not happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator talks about this .07-of-a-degree change. What he says is a reduction. But what we are looking at is an automatic increase in rate of increase that is going to occur no matter what. So somebody can doubt whether you are going to have a reduction. That is not the point. The point is, there is  going to be a level of increase that goes up to a percentage which varies from about 2 degrees centigrade to 3 degrees centigrade, up to 7.7 degrees Fahrenheit.  And .07 of a degree from that is not going to make a difference with respect to the fundamental issue of the Earth warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, let's debate apples and apples, not something else. I think that is important in this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this time, if the Senator wants, we can yield back our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield my time, except for 1 minute for the chairman of the committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to talk about something else for a moment to let Senators know where we are. We have been working staff to staff. We are so close to completing this WRDA bill. Once we vote on this 60-vote issue, we are down to a few amendments. There is a managers' package that has been signed off on by the leaders of the committee. We would like to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we want to say to colleagues on both sides is, if you want to participate in this bill, tonight would be the night to do it because we are wrapping this thing up tomorrow. Our hope is we can complete it. We have this managers' package. If you have something you need to say about this bill, if you have a last-minute amendment you want to show us, this would be the time, this would be the moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield some time to my colleague if he wishes to make some comments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>No. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee and the manager of this bill. Let me say I agree with everything the Senator said. I thought we were going to finish it tonight, but if it is tomorrow, it is tomorrow. It is too significant not to finish it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts joining me in yielding back the remainder of our time. We are going to be ready to take a vote here shortly.</paragraph>
