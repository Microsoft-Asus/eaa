    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased that a report by AARP acknowledged consumer-directed health plans often provide more freedom of choice, lower premiums while giving consumers more control over their health care. This year I introduced <bill type="h" number="2639">H.R. 2639</bill> to expand and improve coverage under these patient-centered plans. Public and private sector leaders must do more to empower patients with convenient, reliable information on cost and quality so consumers can purchase better care at a lower cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent reports contend that health care plans haven't done enough in this area. These criticisms underscore the need to quickly build on gains we have made in health care transparency. Secretary Leavitt has laid important ground work in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2639">H.R. 2639</bill>, coupled with better information for patients, will improve access, lower costs and improve quality of health care. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
