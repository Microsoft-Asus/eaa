  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we members of the Congressional Black Caucus, under the leadership of our chairwoman, CAROLYN CHEEKS KILPATRICK, are taking time to commemorate Juneteenth and reflect on this historical event in 1865 when the news of their emancipation was finally received by 250,000 enslaved in Texas, 2 years late. And as we do so, it seems appropriate that we reflect on the inequities that continue to plague the African American community, the remedies for which are  also too late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, as we take the floor of the seat of government in our country, we say the time is now. Again, better later than never for this 110th Congress to bring another message of freedom to African Americans, freedom from economic blight, from lack of access to quality and comprehensive health care, from substandard housing, and from the issue that is the subject of our discussion tonight: rundown, poorly equipped, and understaffed schools and the overall inequities in our Nation's educational  system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June also marks the celebration of graduation season across the Nation. And as we cheer millions of high school graduates, we must not forget the 1.2 million students who left school this year without a high school diploma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dropouts are twice as likely to be unemployed. Even those who work, for those who work the pay is low. Opportunity for advancement is limited, and health insurance is essentially unavailable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a particular problem in communities of color. For African Americans and Latinos, the dropout rate approaches an astonishing and alarming 50 percent and affects all communities, large or small, rural or urban, including our territories. This high rate of high school dropout and the consequent unemployment disproportionately affect African American males. According to the last U.S. Census, the fraction of black men with a high school education or less is about 50 percent, nearly half of  the black male population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A report published by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation last year indicated that the employment for what they call less educated black men has been in decline during the last decade, and this, despite the fact that opportunities exist to reverse this because of discrimination in hiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The racial difference in the labor force participation rates are sharpest for those without a high school degree. Only half of prime-age black men without a high school degree are in the labor force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, education is everyone's issue. However, the current administration seems to have an opposing view as they propose to completely cut funding for the Dropout Prevention Program. The Youth Activities Program, under their fiscal year 2008 budget proposal, would lose $100 million of funding compared to 2006, and Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities grant program would almost be cut by $150 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funding needs to be restored. These programs are part of the solution to the dropout problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we in the Congressional Black Caucus are issuing a call to action across our Nation to reduce the dropout rate and raise the graduation rate above its current level of 70 percent. Keeping our people in improved schools must be a part of the debate and be addressed as we move to reauthorize and fund an amended and improved No Child Left Behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the Campaign for High School Equity met on the Hill to address and  help us address this very issue. Among the reasons cited as causes of the persistent dropout rates are lack of parental involvement and one I heard in focus groups of young men in my own district: poorly devised and presented curricula that don't keep or stimulate our students' interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We urge the appropriators to include incentives to address this issue, to improve graduation rates and to ensure an increase in funding for key programs like Upward Bound in the 2008 appropriation. This program also helps to reverse our Nation's dropout rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another factor that is indirectly related is one that was the subject of Bob Herbert's column last Saturday, lack of employment for teens during the high school year and in the summer. We are at the lowest national teen employment rate in the past 60 years at 33.1 percent, according to one study from Northeastern University. Again, this bleak outlook is primarily affecting Black teens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Herbert said: "This is the flip side of the American dream. Kids who grow up poor and never work at a regular job tend not to think in terms of post-graduate degrees, marriages, careers, and the cost of educating the next generation. A steady job could make all the difference. Along with the paycheck comes a sense of the possibilities. Kids develop a clearer understanding of the value of education and are more likely to stay in school."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No Child Left Behind created widespread pressure to improve academic achievement. While many districts have struggled to meet benchmarks set by this legislation, far too many of our children, especially African American children, are still being left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to apply the same pressure, focus, and funding to improve the educational environment and experience and to provide the tools that are needed for education success in all of our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The enslaved Africans in Texas waited 2 years to finally hear the word that they were free. Let us not have our young children and people wait one minute longer for the education they need and the future they deserve.</paragraph>
