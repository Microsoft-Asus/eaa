    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Best Buddies Chapter from Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, MD, for being named "Chapter of the Year" by Best Buddies International. Best Buddies is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by providing opportunities for one-to-one friendships and integrated employment. Founded by Anthony K. Shriver in 1989, Best Buddies focuses on the importance of social  integration for a group that is often overlooked by society. They achieve their mission by creating "buddy pairs" in student-run chapters at middle schools, high schools, and colleges around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, Best Buddies holds its international leadership conference at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN, where over 1,300 high school and college students are trained on how to run an effective Best Buddies chapter--skills that will serve them well throughout their academic and professional lives. During the conference the organization acknowledges certain chapters that have achieved a particular level of excellence throughout the past year. The Chapter of the Year is selected by the  board of directors and is based on the quality of the one-to-one friendships, chapter leadership, and activities. For 2007, 75 chapters applied, and Walter Johnson High School was awarded this impressive distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chapter exemplified the true meaning of team work. As a team they worked together and planned incredibly successful events, fundraisers, and group outings. Their great sense of spirit and enthusiasm showed in every activity they undertook and in the deeply rewarding friendships they created. Through the tireless outreach of the chapter members, the general student population at Walter Johnson learned first hand that the similarities between children with and without intellectual disabilities  far outweigh the differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that you will join me in recognizing the importance of what these high school students are doing through their participation in the Best Buddies program and the excellence with which they do it.</paragraph>
