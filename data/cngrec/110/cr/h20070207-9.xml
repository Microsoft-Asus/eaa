  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are sacrificing our entire domestic agenda for an illegal war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at the President's budget, reductions in education and health care over a period of time will cause many necessary programs to be cut for the American people. Meanwhile, the White House is discussing whether or not to bring refugees from Iraq to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, think about it a minute. We are prosecuting an illegal war in Iraq, we are illegally occupying the country, we are building permanent bases in Iraq, and now we are talking about bringing refugees here. The real humanitarian thing to do would be to end the war by ending the occupation, closing the bases and bringing our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is exactly what my 12-point plan would do. I reached it with the help of people from the international community, the U.N., people who have experience in peacekeeping. They say we can bring in an international security force once we get agreement from the countries in the region, and we can bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to stop this disaster in Iraq, bring our troops home, end the occupation.</paragraph>
