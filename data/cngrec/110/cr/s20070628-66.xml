    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is the Defense authorization bill. I hope there will be a little conversation about this tomorrow. This will get us back and focusing on the intractable war that is taking place in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made a call a day or two ago to speak to Keith Modgling, the father of Josh. He just turned 22. He was in Iraq for less than a month. He was killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to refocus on this. It is important we do that.</paragraph>
