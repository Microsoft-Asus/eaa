  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the goals and ideals of World AIDS Day, which took place on Saturday, December 1. I also want to thank my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California, for her leadership in organizing this message hour and for introducing a resolution commemorating the occasion, which I have cosponsored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nineteen years after the first World Aids Day and more than 25 years since the AIDS epidemic began, the need to spread the message about this devastating disease is as critical as ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Worldwide, the United National Programme on HIV/AIDS estimates that 33.2 million people are living with the disease, 2.5 million of whom are newly infected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS. Tragically, communities of color and African Americans in particular are disproportionately impacted. African Americans are currently more likely to suffer from this disease, and the race gap is growing as we speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the fact that African Americans constitute approximately 13 percent of the total United States population, they account for over 44 percent of all persons living with AIDS and 49 percent of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This trend is illustrated when the numbers are examined by subgroup as well. The CDC found in 2005 that women represented 26 percent of all new HIV/AIDS infections, with African American women 25 times more likely to be infected than white women and accounting for 64 percent of all women living with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2005 CDC study of 1,700 gay men in five cities found that African American men were infected at nearly twice the rate of whites, 46 percent compared to 25 percent. In my hometown of Baltimore, only an hour's drive away, 8 percent of the men interviewed had become infected in the previous year, the highest rate in any city surveyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These trends persist despite there being little difference between the sexual practices of white and African American gay men. Racial disparities in HIV and AIDS can be attributed at least in part to the same factors that contribute to racial disparities in overall public health: poor access to life-saving care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Researchers find that African Americans are more likely to be infected with other sexually transmitted diseases, which makes them more likely to catch or transmit HIV. Further, African Americans are less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications which can lower the concentration of the virus in the bloodstream, thereby decreasing the risk of transmission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we cannot afford to ignore these troubling trends any longer. Nearly a quarter of a century after HIV emerged, it continues to wreak havoc upon communities across the world. We must remain vigilant in our efforts to stamp out this global pandemic for the benefit of generations yet unborn.</paragraph>
