  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 1553. A bill to provide additional assistance to combat HIV/AIDS among young people, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1553">S. 1553</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to introduce legislation to strengthen our international HIV prevention efforts and empower the people on the ground who are fighting this disease to design the most effective and appropriate HIV prevention program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is cosponsored by Senator Leahy, Senator Durbin, Senator Clinton, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Brown, Senator Kerry, Senator Boxer, Senator Dodd, Senator Murray, and Senator Feingold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill simply strikes the provision in the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 that mandates that at least 33 percent of HIV prevention funding in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, be set aside "abstinence-until-marriage" programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear from the beginning: this bill does not prohibit the administration from funding "abstinence-until-marriage" programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, if the bill becomes law, the administration would still be able to spend all of our HIV prevention funding on abstinence-until-marriage programs if it decided do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is about giving the administration and HIV/AIDS workers the flexibility to design the most effective HIV prevention program without having to worry about artificial earmarks that are based on politics, not science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, we cannot afford to tie ourselves down with undue restrictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Worldwide, 40 million people are infected with HIV. Each day, approximately 12,000 people are newly infected with HIV. In 2006, there were 4.3 million new HIV infections around the world, 2.8 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to almost two-thirds of the estimated 40 million people currently living with HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate for the adult population is 6 percent. Mr. President, 2.1 million adults and children died of AIDS in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these devastating numbers, according to UNAIDS, less than one in five people at risk for infection of HIV have access to basic prevention services. Studies have shown that two-thirds of new HIV infections could be averted with effective prevention programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we still have a long ways to go to rein in this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2003 HIV/AIDS legislation recognized that prevention, along with care and treatment, is an essential component of that fight and demands a multipronged approach. It endorsed the "ABC" model for prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV: abstain, be faithful, use condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet instead of allowing HIV/AIDS workers and doctors the ability to use all of the prevention tools at their disposal to respond to local needs, we required them to spend at least 33 percent on "abstinence-until marriage" programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question has to been asked: Why 33 percent? Why not 15 percent? Why not 50 percent? What scientific study concluded that 33 percent of HIV prevention funds for abstinence only programs was appropriate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was no study and it begs the question: when you are fighting a pandemic that has already cost so many lives, who should decide how to allocate funding among different types of HIV prevention programs, Congress or the people with the knowledge and expertise on how to fight this disease?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support abstinence programs as a critical part of our HIV prevention programs. But mandating an earmark has negative consequences for other effective tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It means less money for funds to prevent mother-to-child transmission, less money to promote a comprehensive prevention message to high risk groups such as sexually active youth, and fewer funds to protect the blood supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the evidence clearly shows that the one-third earmark has inhibited the ability of local communities to design a multipronged HIV prevention program that works best for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Government Accountability Office issued a report that found "significant challenges" associated with meeting the abstinence-until-marriage programs. The report concluded that the 33 percent abstinence spending requirement is squeezing out available funding for other key HIV prevention programs such as mother-to-child transmission and maintaining a health blood supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Country teams that are not exempted from the one-third earmark have to spend more than 33 percent of prevention funds on abstinence-until-marriage activities, sometimes at the expense of other programs, in order for the administration to meet the overall 33 percent earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spending requirement limited or reduced funding for programs directed to high-risk groups, such as sexually active youth and the majority of country teams on the ground reported that meeting the spending requirement "challenges their ability to develop interventions that are responsive to local epidemiology and social norms."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, a congressionally mandated review by the Institute of Medicine on the first 3 years of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief also found significant problems with the abstinence earmark. It concluded: there is no evidence to support a 33 percent abstinence only earmark; the 33 percent earmark does not allow country teams on the ground the flexibility they need to respond to local needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill seeks to address the problems highlighted in the GAO and the Institute of Medicine reports and provide local communities the necessary flexibility to achieve the goal we all share: stopping the spread of HIV, especially among young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, our bill balances congressional priorities with public health needs. Under our legislation, country teams can take into account country needs including cultural differences, epidemiology, population age groups and the stage of the epidemic in designing the most effective prevention program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One size does not fit all. A prevention program in one country may look a lot different than a prevention program in another country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A May 2003 report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Henry J. Kaiser Foundation highlights that proven prevention programs include behavior change programs, including delay in the initiation of sexual activity, faithfulness and correct and consistent condom use; testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases; promoting voluntary counseling and testing; harm reduction programs for IV drug users; preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child; increasing blood safety;  empowering women and girls; controlling infection in health care settings; and devising programs geared towards people living with HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, studies have shown that combining drugs with counseling and instruction on use of such drugs reduces mother-to-child transmission by 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such cost effective programs are not related to abstinence and should not be constrained by the 33 percent earmark on funds for prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the importance of teaching abstinence. It is and will remain a key part of our strategy in preventing the spread of HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let us listen to the words of someone with firsthand experience about the challenges sub-Saharan African countries face in combating HIV/AIDS and the constraints the "abstinence-until-marriage" earmark places on those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an August 19, 2005, op-ed in the New York Times, Babatunde Osotimehin, chairman of the National Action Committee on AIDS in Nigeria, wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abstinence is one critical prevention strategy, but it cannot be the only one. Focusing on abstinence assumes young people can choose whether to have sex. For adolescent girls in Nigeria and in many other countries, this is an inaccurate assumption. Many girls fall prey to sexual violence and coercion. ..... When dealing with AIDS, we must address the realities and use a multipronged approach to improving education and health systems, one that can reach all of our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He concludes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National governments must have the freedom to employ the very best strategies at our disposal to help our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not agree more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want to help the girls of Nigeria and the youth of sub-Saharan Africa, we cannot limit the information they receive about keeping them safe from acquiring HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not have time to lose. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and support a pro-abstinence, multipronged approach to preventing the spread of HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="Introducing S. 1554. A bill to comprehensively address challenges relating to energy independence, air pollution, and climate change facing the United States; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1554">S. 1554</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Energy Independence, Clean Air, and Climate Security Act of 2007. This legislation takes an integrated approach that is much needed and long overdue if we are to address effectively three intertwined issues of crucial importance to our Nation's economy and security and to the health of our people and our planet. I am very pleased to be joined on this legislation by Senator Lieberman, a true leader on energy, climate change, and  environmental issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader has announced the Senate may well take up a broad package of energy legislation next week. The bill I am introducing today lays out my own vision of how our Nation can best address its energy problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Mark Twain were with us today, it is not hard to imagine he would rephrase his famous quip about the weather to something along the lines of: Everyone talks about climate change and energy independence, but nobody does anything about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the actions we take to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to clean our air, and to reduce our contribution to climate change all affect each other, it is necessary we develop a comprehensive strategy for all three of these challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, since the oil embargo of 1973, through 17 Congresses and 7 different Presidents, energy efficiency and energy independence have generated a lot  of talk, some pretty good ideas, and a lot of promises but not enough concerted, determined, coordinated action. During these 34 years, our Nation's imports of foreign oil have soared from less than 35 percent to more than 60 percent, leaving us dangerously reliant on unstable regions of the world in  order to fuel our Nation and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to our increased reliance on foreign oil, we are also consuming more and more electricity. As demand puts increasing pressure on supply, electricity prices have soared. In the summer, when air-conditioners struggle to keep up with rising temperatures, we run the risk of blackouts, brownouts, and price spikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, our greenhouse gas emissions have soared, leading to virtually indisputable evidence that human activity is contributing to climate change. In the United States, emissions of the primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Globally, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere now far exceed the natural range over the last 650,000 years. We know this from scientific analyses of ice cores and other evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the increase in greenhouse gas emissions has already increased global temperatures and has likely contributed to more extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods. These emissions will continue to change the climate, causing warming in most regions and likely causing more floods, droughts, and an increase in the intensity of hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Climate change is not the only environmental problem caused by fossil fuel use. The quality of our air also suffers. Although we have made some important strides in improving air quality since the 1970s, we have not done enough. Fossil fuel use is the primary cause of mercury pollution, smog, and acid rain that continue to plague our Nation. Indeed, air pollution causes thousands of asthma attacks and costs many lives annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come to address our air quality, climate change, high energy prices, and dangerous reliance on foreign oil. The legislation I am introducing today is, I believe, the first Senate bill that would address all these problems in a single, integrated approach. There have been many bills introduced that address one of these problems. This is an attempt to have a comprehensive approach and to recognize that each of these problems affects the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation focuses primarily on two sectors of the economy: electricity and transportation. Together, these two sectors account for 73 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. Electricity generation accounts for more than 40 percent of our carbon dioxide emissions. More than 80 percent of these emissions are attributable to coal-fired powerplants. Coal-fired powerplants are also the single largest source of mercury pollution, smog, and acid rain. Between 1990 and 2004, emissions from these sectors  increased by 27 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation requires utilities to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020, while also addressing the emissions that cause smog, acid rain, and mercury pollution. It includes a renewable portfolio  standard which would help to diversify our electricity supplies and energy efficiency resource standards that the Alliance to Save Energy estimates would save consumers, over time, billions of dollars on their electricity bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The transportation sector, which relies almost entirely on oil, is not only partly responsible for our dangerous reliance on foreign oil but also accounts for 33 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. My legislation would help to reduce emissions from this sector through a combination of provisions such as CAFE standards for automobiles and heavy-duty trucks, tax incentives for consumers to encourage them to purchase hybrid and alternative fueled vehicles, incentives for manufacturers to produce  the next generation of energy-efficient vehicles, and a low carbon fuel standard that will help to replace some gasoline with biofuels. Taken together, these provisions will substantially reduce our reliance on foreign oil, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by hundreds of millions of tons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to make clear the choice is not between hobbling our Nation's economy and protecting our environment. This legislation is based on the principle that research, development, and implementation of new approaches to energy independence and environmental stewardship will provide a powerful new stimulus for our economy. All too often, we are confronted with proposals to address one issue that only aggravate another problem. The integrated approach I am proposing will help us break through that  impasse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation does not attempt to reinvent the wheel. In fact, it incorporates several good ideas from my colleagues that have been introduced as separate bills, many of which I have cosponsored, such as the Ten-in-Ten and other CAFE bills, the DRIVE Act, and the Clean Power Act. It includes provisions of legislation I have introduced to address abrupt climate change and to eliminate certain tax credits for the oil industry. It contains many of the excellent energy efficiency provisions in  the Energy for Our Future Act introduced by Representative CHRIS SHAYS in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill is also complementary with the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act. We need to pass that bill in order to establish a nationwide cap and trade program for addressing climate change. However, the regulations to implement that could take many years. The legislation I am proposing today will help us take some early action to help achieve the targets in the McCain-Lieberman bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the first step toward energy independence is to make better, more efficient use of our current energy supplies. The first title of this bill tackles that issue on several fronts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would implement the "Ten-in-Ten" legislation I have co-sponsored with Senators Feinstein and Snowe to increase fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2016. It would then go a step further and increase CAFE standards to 45 miles per gallon by 2025. This provision would save approximately 2.5 million barrels of oil per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would help consumers buy more fuel-efficient cars by repealing the phase-out of the tax credit for hybrid vehicles, which is scheduled to sunset at the end of 2009. It would also require light trucks that use diesel fuel to meet more stringent EPA emission standards in order to qualify for the lean-burn credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public transportation is one of the most effective ways we can get more passenger miles per gallon. This legislation would promote the development and use of public transportation by subsidizing fares, encouraging employers to assist their employees with fares, and authorizing funding to build energy-efficient and environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as clean buses and light rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would direct the Department of Transportation to designate 20 Transit-Oriented Development Corridors in urban areas by 2015, and 50 by 2025. These TOD Corridors would be developed with the aid of grants to state and local governments to construct or improve facilities for motorized transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. These provisions would be funded by an authorization of $500 million per year from 2007 through 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do more to encourage the development and manufacture of energy-efficient vehicles. This legislation would create a 20-percent investment tax credit for automobile manufacturers, and a fuel economy achievement credit for manufacturers that have a combined fleet fuel economy that exceeds that of their 2005 model year. This credit would begin at 5 percent next year and rise to 50 percent in 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we must do more to help existing vehicles be as energy efficient as possible. This legislation would direct the DOT to create a National Tire Fuel Efficiency Program that would include tire testing and labeling, energy-efficient tire promotions through incentives and information, and the creation of minimum fuel economy standards for tires. These standards would establish the maximum technically feasible and cost-effective fuel savings without adversely affecting tire safety or average tire  life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heavy-duty vehicles move our economy. This legislation would keep them on the move while helping to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions.  It would require DOT to develop a testing and assessment program to determine what is feasible to improve the efficiency of heavy vehicles, and then to develop the appropriate fuel-economy standards. It also would provide a tax credit of up to $3,500 for the purchase of idling reduction technology for heavy vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for the Federal Government to lead by example, this legislation would require the Secretary of Energy to issue regulations for federal fleets covered by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to reduce petroleum consumption by 30 percent from a 1999 baseline by 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II of my legislation focuses on increasing our energy independence and reducing our emissions from the transportation sector through the use of alternative fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Renewable fuels offer great potential to help us achieve greater energy independence. This legislation would help us realize that potential by establishing a clean, renewable fuels performance standard. The performance standard would require fuel providers to increase the volume of clean, low-carbon, renewable fuels by up to 35 billion gallons by 2025, unless EPA finds that the increase is technically infeasible or is likely to result in adverse impacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would expand existing tax credits for ethanol to include cellulosic biomass. While there has been a great deal of focus on using corn-based ethanol in order to decrease our reliance upon foreign oil, there are other renewable, plant-based energy sources that are more environmentally friendly and have greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Researchers at the University of Maine have been at the forefront of applying a research technique known as "Life Cycle Analysis." Life Cycle Analysis is a unique interdisciplinary research tool that analyzes the energy requirements and environmental footprint involved with the manufacture, use, and disposal of a material. This technique is ideal for identifying fuels which have the lowest environmental impact and the greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while reducing  our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation would authorize $275 million over five years for research that would use Life Cycle Analysis in order to identify and develop new biotechnologies. These technologies will help move our petroleum-based economy toward a renewable, sustainable forest bio-economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Environmental stewardship must go beyond the tailpipes of our vehicles to the smokestacks of our power plants. Title III of my legislation builds upon the Clean Power Act that I introduced in the last Congress with Senators Jeffords and Lieberman. I have, however, modified this provision to provide assistance to small businesses struggling with high electricity costs. I have also included increased funding for important conservation programs such as Forest Legacy, in order to  help wildlife adapt to the impacts of climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would cut all four major power plant pollutants over the next six years. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog, acid rain, and asthma attacks, would be cut by 75 percent. Toxic mercury emissions would be cut by 90 percent from 1999 levels, and carbon dioxide, which forms the heat-trapping blanket that contributes to global warming, would be cut to 1990 levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These reductions would do more than provide long-term protection for our environment; they also would produce dramatic and immediate health gains for our people. According to the EPA, quick and decisive cuts in nitrogen and sulfur emissions from power plants would save 18,700 lives every year, avoid 366,000 asthma attacks, and prevent $100 billion in health care costs. In addition, these cuts would combat the acid rain that is spoiling some of our Nation's most treasured parks and wilderness  areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Centers for Disease Control has concluded that 4.9 million women of childbearing age have elevated levels of mercury, and that 322,000 newborns are at risk of neurological damage from mercury exposure. This provision preserves our national commitment to reduce toxic threats to pregnant women and to children by requiring meaningful reductions and by prohibiting trading.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clean Power Act incorporated into this legislation closes the grandfather loophole that exempts dirty, aging power plants from cleanup. Every power plant will be required to meet the most modern pollution control standards by either the plant's 40th year of operation or by the fifth year of the enactment of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clean Power Act uses market mechanisms, such as buying and selling pollution allowances known as "emissions trading." As I have already stated, under my bill, this trading will not be allowed for toxic mercury. Nor will it be allowed if it enables a power plant to pollute at a level that damages public health or the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Power plants are the largest source of our Nation's contribution to global warming; as I stated earlier, they account for some 40 percent of our carbon dioxide emissions. This legislation would return carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels. By providing electricity producers with regulatory certainty now about future pollution-reduction requirements, this legislation would allow smarter investments and more cost-efficient planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with existing motor vehicles, we must make more efficient use of the energy we now produce to heat our homes and power our lights. This legislation would double funding for the Department of Energy Weatherization Program, reaching $1.4 billion for 2008. It also would provide predictable funding for the valuable Energy Star Program, which helps consumers buy energy efficient appliances, and would extend the renewable electricity tax credit through 2011 and the residential investment tax credit  for solar and energy efficient buildings through 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also includes an Energy Efficiency Performance Standard for utilities. This provision requires utilities to achieve energy efficiency improvements. This provision would help consumers save on their electricity bills. By way of example, in California, where a similar provision was employed, utilities achieved energy savings at a cost of around 2-4 cents per kilowatt hour. According to the Alliance to Save Energy, an Energy Efficiency Performance Standard could save consumers $64  billion in net savings, and avoid the need to build 400 power plants, preventing 320 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, my legislation includes a renewable portfolio standard which would require utilities to generate 20 percent of their electricity from environmentally sound renewable energy sources by the year 2020. For example, biomass electricity generated under this provision must be done using sustainable forest practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will help Americans save on utility bills, and make our tax code fairer, too. Title V would eliminate two major tax credits that benefit large oil and gas companies: tax credits for intangible drilling costs and for excess percentage over cost depletions. This would save the taxpayers billions of dollars over the next five years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also would help us better understand and assess climate change. During the last three years, I have had the opportunity to meet in the field with some of the world's foremost climate scientists. I have traveled to Ny-Alesund, Norway, the northernmost community in the world, where I saw the dramatic loss of sea-ice cover and the retreating Arctic glaciers. I have seen the same alarming changes in Alaska. Just a year ago, I went to the other end of the world and met with researchers--including  a team from the University of Maine's outstanding Climate Change Institute--in Antarctica. These regions are the canary in the coal mine, and the changes taking place provide a warning we cannot ignore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nor can we forestall taking action by arguing over the precise extent of climate change and the human contribution to it. The answer to scientific uncertainty is additional research. Title VI of my legislation would authorize $60 million for abrupt climate change research. Studies suggest that the climate can change dramatically within a very short period of time. An abrupt climate change triggered by the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases could cause catastrophic droughts and floods.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="7184">S7184</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few issues of greater concern to my constituents in my home state of Maine than our nation's ongoing and escalating reliance on foreign oil, and the damage our vehicle and power plant emissions are doing to the environment. They bear the brunt of wildly fluctuating and steadily increasing energy prices. They know the harm this dependence causes to our national security, and they know the harm our current energy usage causes to the air they breathe. And although a bone-chilling, winter  nor'easter may bring a new round of jokes about the possible benefits of global warming, they know that human-caused climate change is no laughing matter. They know we must be better stewards of our planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that all Americans--whether they live in the sunny south or a winter wonderland--share these concerns. They have heard enough talk; they want us to act. Americans deserve to breathe clean air, pay reasonable gasoline and electricity prices, live in a world with a stable climate future, and have the peace of mind that comes with secure energy supplies. The Energy Independence, Clean Air, and Climate Security Act offers a comprehensive, integrated approach to these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, let me describe the six titles very briefly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first title of my bill would increase energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving the efficiency of our transportation sector. The second title would accomplish similar goals by replacing some gasoline with alternative fuels. The third title would reduce emissions of mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides from powerplants. The fourth title would help to reduce heat and electricity bills and diversify our electricity supply through a combination  of energy efficiency and renewable energy provisions. The fifth title would help save taxpayers money through the elimination of certain tax breaks for the oil industry. Finally, the sixth title would authorize $60 million for abrupt climate change research to help us better understand this phenomenon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly excited about renewable fuels. I think there is a lot we could do to expand the tax break for ethanol to include cellulosic biomass. There is very exciting research being done at the University of Maine which has been in the forefront of applying a research technique known as "Life Cycle Analysis," which is a tool that analyzes the energy requirements and environmental footprint involved in the manufacture, use, and disposal of a material. It is ideal for identifying fuels  which have the lowest environmental impact and the greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil. This technology will help us move our petroleum-based economy toward a renewable, sustainable, forest bioeconomy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a complex bill. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="Introducing S. 1557. A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve 21st Century Community Learning Centers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1557">S. 1557</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague Senator ENSIGN, to introduce the Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007, which will provide children with safe, healthy, and academically focused afterschool programs. This bill is endorsed by the Afterschool Alliance, an organization representing more than 20,000 public, private, and nonprofit afterschool providers who are dedicated to expanding access to high quality afterschool programs, as well as  many other national and local organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 14 million children enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade spend time unsupervised in the hours after school. Between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., while parents are at work, kids are most likely to experiment with risky behaviors. To the contrary, students who regularly attend afterschool programs have better grades and behavior in school, better peer relations and emotional adjustment, and lower incidences of drug use, violence, and pregnancy. America's families rely on afterschool  programs to give their children the opportunity to be engaged in high quality learning activities that will enhance their children's success in school and in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007 is designed to do three things: enhance program quality and sustainability, address the obesity epidemic by including physical fitness and wellness programs in the list of possible programming activities, and encourage service learning. First, our bill provides States with tools designed to sustain high quality afterschool programs by allowing program grantees to renew their grants based on their program performance. The legislation  also gives States the option to expand their technical assistance functions to further improve the quality of afterschool programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this bill will increase opportunities for children and young people to be more physically active. As obesity reaches epidemic proportions in our society, allowing for such opportunities is critical in ensuring our children's overall health. Obesity is among the easiest medical conditions to recognize, but among the most difficult to treat. The annual cost to society for obesity is estimated at nearly $100 billion. Physical activity and wellness programs are critical to our overall health  and well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this bill encourages children to be involved in service learning and youth development activities. Service learning integrates student designed service projects with academic studies. This type of program has been shown to strengthen student engagement, enhance student achievement, lower drop out and suspension rates, develop workforce and leadership skills and provide opportunities for team work. The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act will help build the character and  work ethic of our children and youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is of paramount importance that we adequately fund our afterschool programs. Currently, afterschool programs have served, at most, only 1.4 million children. It is critical that we provide more opportunities for youth to be engaged in high quality afterschool programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act provides a critical first step toward ensuring the health, safety, and education of our Nation's children. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="Introducing S. 1557. A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve 21st Century Community Learning Centers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007 with my colleague, Senator CHRIS DODD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007 will go a long way toward providing our Nation's children with safe, healthy, and academically focused aftershool programs. Mr. President, 21st century community learning centers provide students in rural and inner-city public schools with access to homework centers, tutors, mentors, and drug and alcohol prevention counseling, as well as cultural and recreational activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 14.3 million children go home alone when the school day ends, including over 40,000 kindergartners and almost 4 million middle school students. With less than half of the children in afterschool programs, the parents of another 15.3 million children say their children would participate in afterschool--if a program were available. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program is a critical resource to children, families, and communities in their struggle to meet the need for high-quality  afterschool programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program is a worthwhile and necessary investment--evaluations show that these investments are having a great impact on children's academic achievement and behavior. In 2003-2004, 45 percent of all program participants had improved their reading grades and 41 percent improved their math grades. Teachers reported that a majority of the students participating in the programs improved their academic performance, improved their school attendance, completed  more homework on time and to the teacher's satisfaction, and improved their class participation. Beyond the academic gains, these programs are making kids and communities safer by reducing vandalism and juvenile crime. It is important that we provide our children with access to high-quality, safe, and enriching environments in the hours after the school day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When my colleagues and I passed the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002 it included a bipartisan commitment to quality afterschool programs and investment in the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. The learning centers are currently funded at $981 million and serve about 1 million children, yet this is just a fraction--7 percent--of the children who are eligible for the program and need access to high-quality afterschool programs. Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act  of 2007 will address this need and provide our children with the sustainable afterschool opportunities that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent evaluations of 21st Century Community Learning Center Programs show that participating students are improving both their academic performance and social behavior in and out of the classroom. Yet maintaining quality programs takes constant effort and resources. This legislation increases the investments in quality that are critical to ensuring that programs not only contribute to children's academic and social development but also give young people the opportunities that will ensure their  college and workplace readiness in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the father of three and as a former latch-key kid myself, I understand the benefits of providing children with a place to go and activities to help them excel. I am committed to ensuring that our schools have the assistance they need to ensure that our children leave the public education system as well-rounded individuals. Children attending public schools should not only be proficient in reading, writing, and arithmetic but also be skillful in music, art, and athletics. It is my sincere hope  that my colleagues in the Senate will recognize this important need and cosponsor the Improving 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleagues, Senators DOMENICI and KENNEDY, that seeks to meet the mental health needs of children and adolescents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the task of ensuring the emotional well-being and resiliency of our young people is one of paramount importance. We all know that mental health is a critical component contributing to a child's general health and ability to grow both intellectually and physically. Yet, the task of ensuring the mental health of children and adolescents is not an easy one. In fact, it is arguably one of the most difficult and largely unspoken tasks facing our Nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA, 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffer from mental health disorders serious enough to cause some level of impairment. Out of these young people, only one in five receive the specialty mental health services they require.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These startling statistics prompted former Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher to convene a conference in 1999 that examined the mental health needs of children. The conference, composed of some of the Nation's leading experts in mental and public health published a seminal report that concluded that "..... the burden of suffering experienced by children with mental illness and their families has created a health crisis in this country." The report further concluded that "..... there is broad  evidence that the Nation lacks a unified infrastructure to help children suffering from mental illness."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "burden of suffering" described in Surgeon General Satcher's report is a burden endured by millions of children, adolescents, and their families in Connecticut and across our Nation. Throughout my Senate career, I have heard from families who have shared with me their personal stories in struggling to care for their children. Their stories have fueled my belief that child and adolescent mental health needs to be a top priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the fragmentation of the Nation's mental health delivery system, Surgeon General Satcher's report concluded that one fundamental way to meet the mental health needs of children and adolescents is to ". . . move towards a community-based mental health delivery system that balances health promotion, disease prevention, early detection, and universal access to care." The report further stated eight goals to ensure the resiliency of children and adolescents. These goals were: first,  to promote public awareness of children's mental health issues and reduce the stigma often associated with mental illness; second, to continue to develop, disseminate, and implement scientifically proven prevention and treatment services in the field of children's mental health; third, to improve the assessment and recognition of mental health needs in children; fourth, to eliminate racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in access to mental health care services; fifth, to improve infrastructure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, President Bush established the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health to study three obstacles identified by the President that prevent Americans with mental illness from getting the care they require. These obstacles were identified as the stigma that too often surrounds mental health care, a lack of mental health parity, and the fragmented mental health delivery system. In 2003, the President's New Freedom Commission issued a report that made a series of recommendations  on how the Nation's mental health system could be transformed for the better. Like Surgeon General Satcher's report, this publication also set forth a series of goals. They were: first, to ensure that Americans understand that mental health is essential to overall health; second, to ensure that mental health care is consumer- and family-driven; third,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I describe these two reports because the legislation I am introducing with my colleagues today seeks to address the recommendations they espouse. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Resiliency Act of 2007 authorizes $205 million in an effort to meet five principal objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first objective is to increase access to, and improve the quality of, mental health care services delivered to children and adolescents. Our legislation seeks to meet this objective in several ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it authorizes a new grant of $50 million for states to develop and implement a comprehensive mental health plan exclusively for children and adolescents that provides community-based mental health early intervention and prevention services and relevant support services, such as primary health care, education, transportation and housing. The plan would have to meet a set of core operational and evaluative requirements and would have to be developed through extensive outside consultation  with children and adolescents, their families, advocates and health professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, our legislation authorizes two matching grants of $22.5 million each for community health centers, many of which primarily serve low-income populations, and primary health care facilities, such as a pediatrician's office, to provide community-based mental health services in coordination with community mental health centers and/or trained mental health professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $22.5 million for states, localities and private nonprofit organizations, for example, school districts, to provide community-based mental health services in schools and appropriate mental health training activities to relevant school and health professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $20 million for States, localities and private nonprofit organizations to provide community-based mental health services specifically for at-risk mothers and their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $10 million for States, localities and private nonprofit organizations to provide community-based mental health services for children and adolescents in juvenile justice systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixth, our legislation authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish, run and evaluate a demonstration project that improves the ability of local case managers to work across the mental health, public health, substance abuse, child welfare, education, juvenile justice and social services systems in a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our legislation requires States to meet their statutory obligations to fund fully mental health screening services under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services Program. It also requires current successful initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children with Serious Emotional Disturbance Program, the Community Mental Health Services Performance Partnership block grant, the Community Mental Health Services block grant, and  the Jail Diversion Program, to expand their scope with respect to certain reporting, evaluative, and service activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second objective our legislation seeks to meet is ensuring greater public awareness and greater family participation in mental health services decisionmaking. Toward this end, our legislation does the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for States, localities and private nonprofit organizations to develop policies that enable families of children and adolescents with mental health disorders to have increased control and choice over mental health services provided and received through a publicly funded mental health system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for private nonprofit organizations to provide information on child and adolescent mental health disorders, services, support services and respite care to families of children and adolescents with or who are at risk for mental health disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it authorizes a new grant of $10 million for private nonprofit organizations to develop community coalitions and public education activities that promote child and adolescent resiliency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, our legislation authorizes $10 million to establish two new technical assistance centers. These centers are designed to collect and disseminate information on mental health disorders, mental health disorder risk factors, mental health services, mental health service access, relevant support services, reducing the inappropriate use of seclusion and restraints, and family participation in mental health service decision-making, exclusively for children and adolescents with or at risk  of mental health disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third objective that this legislation seeks to meet is for the Federal Government to develop a policy specifically designed to meet the unique mental health needs of children and adolescents. The legislation authorizes $10 million for the establishment of an interagency coordinating committee consisting of all Federal officials whose departments or agencies oversee mental health activities for children and adolescents. Modeled after language in the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, our legislation  requires the coordinating committee to consult with outside parties, develop a Federal policy exclusively pertaining to child and adolescent mental health, and report annually to Congress on specific challenges and solutions associated with comprehensively addressing the mental health needs of children and adolescents. It also gives the committee flexibility to develop and implement joint demonstration projects that bolster appropriate mental health care services to children and adolescents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fourth and final objective that this legislation seeks to meet is increasing the amount of research into child and adolescent mental health. Only through intensive research can we develop evidence-based best practices that allow us to develop services that fully meet the mental health needs of our children. Toward that end, our legislation authorizes a new grant of $12.5 million for States, localities, institutions of higher education and private nonprofit organizations to identify and research  current service, training and information awareness gaps in mental health delivery systems for children and adolescents. Our legislation also authorizes $12.5 million to enhance comprehensive Federal research and evaluation of promising best practices, existing disparities, psycho-tropic medications, trauma, recovery and rehabilitation, and co-occurring disorders as they relate to child and adolescent mental health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have begun working with my colleagues on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to reauthorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It is my hope that this legislation can contribute to that reauthorization effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to conclude by saying that this legislation, while comprehensive, is a first step, not a complete solution, towards fully meeting the challenge of ensuring the resiliency of our children and adolescents. We need to continue working together--young people, families, doctors, counselors, nurses, teachers, advocates, and policymakers, since we all have a stake, either professional or personal, on this issue. Only by working together can we develop effective and compassionate ways through  which every young person in this Nation is given a solid foundation upon which to reach his or her dreams in life. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join us in this important effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
