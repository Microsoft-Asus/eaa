  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF ERIN RATH -- (Senate - July 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9210">S9210</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my longtime communications director and friend Erin Rath, who for the past 9 years has had the unenviable task of turning a sow's ear to a silk purse, of explaining what I "really" meant and consoling reporters whose call I missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Erin comes from hearty New Hampshire political stock and was brought up in an environment where politics and community service was very much a part of her life. Her mother Chris is a leading educator in Concord, serving as superintendent of schools, and her father Tom is a bit of a legend in New Hampshire politics for offering sound advice to Presidential candidates who wander into the Granite State. But, anyone who knows Erin will tell you she has always cut her own path, willing to take any  task and accomplishing it with a smile. Whether it was dealing with a not so media friendly member or an aggressive reporter, Erin has perfected the skills needed to pitch any story with style and grace. She understands how to craft a message and have it be understood, whether by a weekly paper in New Hampshire or the Wall Street Journal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On those rare days that I didn't want to do press, Erin was always the one coming to me and promoting an interview or conference call and, even when temporarily rebuffed, would find a way to cheerfully get her mission accomplished. And, when she was left to translate the day's events to a press corps that was disinterested or confused, Erin would find a way to make the story intelligible and get it in print or across the airwaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Erin has also worn another very important hat in my office as the lead on appropriations issues. She excelled at organizing and managing my appropriations requests and making sure worthy New Hampshire projects were  not overlooked. Erin has been responsible for helping to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars to better our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as important to Kathy and I has been the friendship that went well beyond the office. Knowing Erin since she was rather young, allowed us the rare opportunity to watch a bubbly, redheaded, star athlete mature into a charming and professional woman and soon to be mother. Whether it was house-sitting or helping watch over our active family, Erin has long been a part of the Gregg family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Erin has decided to delay the dream many of us had for her of running for Congress in New Hampshire until after the birth of her first child and move to Minnesota with her husband Dan Moos as he begins his teaching career at the Gustavus Adolphus College. Erin, after being in the eye of the storm for the past 9 years, will enjoy living in a frozen, quiet land where community spirit is derived from singing the Golden Gophers fight song.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kathy joins me in wishing Erin continued great success and in thanking her for all that she has done for the Gregg family, our office, and New Hampshire.</paragraph>
