  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the purpose of National Women's History Month is to increase awareness and knowledge of women's involvement in history;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas as recently as the 1970s, women's history was rarely included in the kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum and was not part of public awareness;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women initiated a "Women's History Week" celebration in 1978 centered around International Women's History Day, which is celebrated on March 8th;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1981, responding to the growing popularity of women's history celebrations, Congress passed a resolution making Women's History Week a national observance;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during this time, using information provided by the National Women's History Project, founded in Sonoma County, California, thousands of schools and communities joined in the commemoration of National Women's History Week, with support and encouragement from governors, city councils, school boards, and Congress;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1987, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to expand the national celebration to include the entire month of March;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas educators, workplace program planners, parents, and community organizations in thousands of American communities, under the guidance of the National Women's History Project, have turned National Women's History Month into a major local learning experience and celebration;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the popularity of women's history celebrations has sparked a new interest in uncovering women's forgotten heritage;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in American History was established to consider how best to acknowledge and celebrate the roles and accomplishments of women in American history;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Women's History Museum was founded in 1996 as an institution dedicated to preserving, interpreting, and celebrating the diverse historic contributions of women, and integrating this rich heritage fully into the Nation's teachings and history books;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes March, 2008, as National Women's History Month; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the theme of National Women's History Month for 2008 is visionary female artists and their contribution to our cultural heritage: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Women's History Month;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes and honors the women and organizations in the United States that have fought for and continue to promote the teaching of women's history; and</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, March was the 20th Annual National Women's History Month. That is why I am so pleased to introduce <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>, a resolution to recognize and honor this National Women's History Celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America, women were once considered second-class citizens, whose rights were restricted from voting to property ownership, actually. But here we are today; one woman is a major candidate for President of our Nation and another woman is Speaker of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, until the late 1970s, women's history wasn't taught in many of our schools, and was almost completely absent in media coverage and cultural celebrations. That is why the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women, which I chaired, initiated a Women's History Week Celebration in 1978. This celebration centered around International Women's History Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Women's History Project, located in my district, was founded in 1980 by many dedicated women who poured their hearts and their ideas into promoting and expanding the weeklong celebration. With the help of several dedicated women, including Mary Ruthsdotter, Molly Murphy MacGregor, Maria Cuevas, Paula Hammett, and Betty Morgan, thousands of schools and communities joined in the commemoration of Women's History Week by bringing specific lessons on women's achievements into the classroom,  by staging parades to engage neighborhoods in the celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their hard work, their dedication paid off. The celebration started a national movement. And in 1981, Congress responded to the growing popularity of Women's History Week by making it a national observance and eventually expanding the week to a month in 1987. Imagine what American history lessons would be today without the inclusion of Harriet Tubman's Underground Railroad operation, or Mary Katherine Goddard, who was the first person to print the Declaration of Independence with the names of  all the signers included.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in reaffirming our commitment to the celebration of women's history by supporting <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill> that will ensure that our grandchildren and our great grandchildren learn and care about women like Amelia Earhart and eventually of course the first woman President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Waxman, I want to thank Ranking Member Davis, and Chairman Davis for supporting this resolution, as they have continually supported the efforts of all women. Supporting this resolution will make it impossible to study American history without remembering the contributions of women as well. So I thank you all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start by thanking and congratulating the gentlelady from California for bringing this resolution to the floor. It was given a lot of thought. This is something that I think is very, very important, and I am honored to speak in support of <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>, recognizing and celebrating Women's History Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each March we express appreciation for the brilliance, bravery and determination women have demonstrated throughout U.S. history. Women in the United States often found themselves second-class citizens in their own country. They have had to fight for many of the rights men always have enjoyed; to vote, to own property, even in some cases, to be obtain an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the iron will of Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams and mother of John Quincy Adams, who wrote that women, "will not ourselves bound by any laws which we have no voice," to the reforms advanced by Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, women have stood for their country by standing up for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contributions made by women to our Nation can't be overlooked. Clara Barton, a Civil War nurse, founded the American Red Cross. Amelia Earhart was a pioneer in aviation. Harriet Tubman, who we honored earlier today, an escaped African American slave, risked everything to bring others to freedom as the conductor of the Underground Railroad. The Women's Suffrage Movement finally made America whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, American women enjoy many of the fruits of these early labors. They serve at or near the highest levels of government, business and other positions of power and influence. The doors to careers, education and achievement seem as open to them as to men. But that doesn't mean the struggle is over or that heroines of the past should be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to join me by supporting this resolution. I want to again thank Representative Woolsey for bringing this to our attention and thank Chairman Waxman and Chairman Davis for their assistance in bringing this to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank and commend Representative Woolsey for her introduction of this legislation. I also want to thank the 200 women who attended a town hall meeting which I held in my district on Sunday in recognition of Women's History Month. I want to thank Reverend Helen Cooper, Pastor of the Westside Center of Truth Church for being the host.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>, as amended, which is designed to provide recognition and support for National Women's History Month, which just ended yesterday with the conclusion of the month of March.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill> was first introduced by Representative LYNN WOOLSEY of California on March 3, 2008, and has the support and cosponsorship of 80-plus Members of Congress, both men and women from both sides of the aisle. The measure was considered by the Oversight panel on March 13, 2008, and was passed by voice vote after being amended for technical purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I guess it's only accurate to say that history, whether American or International, would not have been written as it is without the role of women. But all too often the vast significance of women throughout history goes unnoticed and under appreciated, which is why organizers in Sonoma County, California, established back in 1978 a public celebration of women's history, calling it Women's History Week. In 1987, Congress expanded the celebration to a month, and March was declared  Women's History Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the 1970s, we in America have seen notable growth in the study and expansion of women's history. In fact, today almost every college offers women's history courses and most major graduate programs offer doctoral degrees in this important field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even today, we continue to witness history makers. From our very own Speaker of the House, to top Presidential contenders, business women, scientists and athletes, women are clearly making key contributions to our communities, our country, and our world. As we celebrate female artists and their contributions to our cultural heritage as this year's theme of National Women's History Month, let us as a body once again elevate and support the goals, ideas and history of Women's History Month and  pass the measure at hand.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's now my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to Representative Tsongas of Massachusetts.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412254" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Women's History Month, and particularly this year's focus on female artists. I commend the organizations and communities across the country that celebrated Women's History Month by educating people about the many contributions women in the arts have made. My hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, is a great example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hard work of members of the Lowell community made Lowell Women's Week 2008 a great success by bringing together diverse organizations that held art displays and workshops all around women's art and history. In Lowell, women's commitment to the arts coincided with the cities founding as this country's first planned industrial city. At the time of its founding in the late 19th century, the young women working the textile mills also published a literary magazine of essays and poetry entitled:  The Lowell Offering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without commemorative months like this one, some of our most interesting women's history would be forgotten. This resolution rightly honors female artists of the past. But I also salute the many women who throughout our communities tirelessly support the arts through philanthropic means or with their time and effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the passage of this resolution today does not mark the end of a month of remembrance, but is a catalyst for renewed interest in learning what great women of the past have given us.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>, supporting the goals, ideals, and history of National Women's History Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As recently as the 1970s, women's history was largely unaddressed in school curriculum and among the general public. In 1987, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to expand the national celebration of Women's History from 1 week to the entire month of March. Since then, the National Women's History Month Resolution has passed both Chambers of Congress with bipartisan support each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of Women's Rights, such as guaranteeing that women and families have adequate time to care for themselves and family members when they become ill, without facing the loss of job security and wages. As a member of the Health Subcommittee, I have worked diligently with my colleagues in Congress to bring increased awareness and services for women's health issues, such as early detection and treatment of ovarian cancer. Since its inception  in 1987, Women's History Month, under the guidance of the National Women's History Project, has become a renowned celebration of the accomplishments of women everywhere, recognizing the limitless opportunities that women have in the modern world, and generating a renewed interest in the rich cultural heritage of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year during Women's History Month, we celebrate female artists and their contribution of originality, beauty, and imagination to the art world. I hope that we will continue to work together in Congress to support the cultural contributions of women, and critical women's rights and women's health issues, not only during Women's History Month, but year round.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400396" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1021, which supports the goals and ideals of National Women's History Month and pays honor to those who promote the teaching of women's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the National Women's History Project, which was founded in northern California, for establishing the legacy of Women's History Month; and I thank Congresswoman Woolsey, a fellow Californian, for bringing this important resolution to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the earliest days of our great Republic, women have been marginalized throughout many parts of society. But as our country has developed, so too have the rights and responsibilities of women. In 1917, Jeanette Rankin blazed a path for women in Congress, putting  the first crack in our country's highest glass ceiling. Only 3 years later, our Nation ratified the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing that political enfranchisement in America will never be denied  due to gender. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act extended gender protections to the workplace and beyond. And as Members of the 110th Congress, we have the privilege to serve alongside a woman who ably executes this institution's highest office and who is the most senior female in American political history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the journey from disenfranchisement and marginalization is not complete. Women working full time still earn 80 cents to every dollar earned by men. In this House--the greatest representative body in the world--the number of women serving is hardly proportional to the population we represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addressing these persistent inequities, I believe we will be well served by a thorough understanding of the great strides taken by women in the past. A study of women's history is a study of America's path toward greater equality and liberty. The story of women in our country lights the way to the fulfillment of our highest ideals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution honors the decision made over two decades ago to set aside time for the teaching of women's history, and it highlights the salience of women's history as we chart a course for the future. I commend Ms. Woolsey for her leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join in affirming the importance of National Women's History Month.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I affirm today my support for <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>, supporting the goals, ideals, and history of National Women's History Month. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution demonstrating the commitment of the House of Representatives to promoting National Women's History Month, which this year celebrates female artists and their contribution of originality, beauty, and imagination to the world of art.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that my home state of South Dakota has a strong tradition of women in the arts and I would like to thank South Dakotans for the Arts for its work promoting the arts and supporting women artists in my home state. I'd like to describe for my colleagues some of the talented and remarkable women artists and authors that have found inspiration in hills and prairies of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women in South Dakota have done the work of art throughout our history, beginning with our First Peoples and continuing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native American women practice traditional art forms passed from generation to generation, adapting changes in materials and technique to add beauty and new texture to the traditional art. Their work includes the quillwork and quilts of Alice New Holy Blue Legs and Nellie Star Boy Menard, as well as the contemporary silver of Linda Szabo and paintings of Joanne Bird.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of South Dakota's pioneer women artists arrived in the Dakota Territory after studying at major schools of art in New York, Boston, Chicago, and Paris. They helped to bring the artistic disciplines of the East and Europe to the Northern Plains. As new colleges and universities were opened in what is present-day South Dakota, women helped to found departments of art and joined the teaching faculty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In South Dakota, these pioneer artists and teachers included two very influential women who contributed both through their own artwork and through their dedication to their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grace French, born in 1858, arrived in Rapid City, Dakota Territory in 1885. She painted the remarkably beautiful landscapes of the area with color and subtlety, adding poetry and beauty to the popular imagination of the Plains and the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ada Bertha Caldwell was born in 1869 and graduated from the School of the Art Institute in Chicago. She accepted a position at Springfield College at Yankton, South Dakota. In 1900, she founded the Department of Art at what is now South Dakota State University, and was a teacher and major influence for Harvey Dunn, a noted illustrator and painter of pioneer life on the South Dakota prairie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Dakotans also celebrate the many talented women in literature that have enriched our lives and deepened our understanding of a sense of place and history with their stories. American favorites from South Dakota include Laura Ingalls Wilder, Linda Hasselstrom, Kathleen Norris and Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these few examples and numerous others, I am pleased to join with my colleagues today to honor these women artists and authors. May their contributions continue to provide joy, education, and inspiration to future generations on the Northern Plains and throughout our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Women's History Month. April was designated as Women's History Month in 1987 to honor women and the achievements they have made throughout the years. I want to pay special tribute to my female colleagues in the California delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that California has led the way in electing women to some of the highest offices in the federal government. Currently, there are 19 women from California in the House of Representatives, more than any other state. Among these are the Speaker of the House, a Chair and a vice-Chair, and 12 subcommittee Chairs. These women, who hold leadership positions, wield an enormous amount of power that was un-heard-of just a couple of decades ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fall of 2006, the American people elected the Democrats to the majority and as a result, they put into motion a process that would ultimately break one of the "glass ceilings" for women in politics. After she was sworn in, NANCY PELOSI, the first ever female Speaker of the House said, "It says to women everywhere that not only a glass ceiling but a marble ceiling can be broken and that anything is possible." This was an historical day for women, not only from the United States,  but from around the world. I have talked to numerous women who have mentioned watching this momentous occasion on TV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These women hold their positions in part because of the hard work of women like Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who served from 1917-1919 and again in 1941-1943; Mae Ella Nolan of California, who served from 1923-1925; Florence Kahn of California, who served from 1925-1937; and Helen Douglas of California, who served from 1945-1951. These women were pioneers in the field of politics at a time when politics was a man's purview. Thanks to these women, we have elected the first woman Speaker of the  House, who is third in line for the Presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute to the women across the country, and around the world, who have made history by their varied accomplishments. And the women who have come before you and have helped lead the way for women in the political arena.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1021">H. Res. 1021</bill>, expressing support for the goals, ideals, and history of National Women's History Month. I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman WOOLSEY, for introducing this legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor. Let me also thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Chairman WAXMAN, for bringing this resolution before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of National Women's History Month is to increase awareness and knowledge of women's involvement in history. I strongly believe that it is vital to honor the originality, beauty, imagination, and multiple dimensions of women's lives. As recently as the 1970s, women's history was rarely taught in schools, and was not part of public awareness. To address this situation, the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County, California, Commission on the Status of Women initiated a "Women's  History Week" celebration for 1978. In 1981, in response to the growing popularity of women's history celebrations, Congress passed a resolution making Women's History Week a national observance. Within a few years, thousands of schools and communities across the country were celebrating National Women's History Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The popularity of women's history celebrations has sparked a new interest in uncovering women's forgotten heritage. Under the guidance of the National Women's History Project, educators, workplace program planners, parents and community organizations in thousands of American communities have turned National Women's History Month into a major celebration and a springboard for celebrating women's history all year round.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the early days of our great Nation, women were relegated to second class status. Women were considered sub-sets of their husbands, and after marriage they did not have the right to own property, maintain their wages, or sign a contract, much less vote. It was expected that women be obedient wives, never to hold a thought or opinion independent of their husbands. It was considered improper for women to travel alone or to speak in public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fight for women's suffrage was formally begun in 1848, and, in 1919, after years of petitioning, picketing, and protest parades, the 19th amendment was passed by both Houses of Congress; it was ratified the following year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the right to vote did not give women equal rights, and subsequent decades saw an ongoing struggle for equality. A major success came with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law, enacted in June 1972, states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title XI, introduced by Congresswoman Patsy Mink, also notable as the first Asian American woman elected to Congress, has opened countless doors to educational activities, perhaps most prominently including high  school and collegiate athletics, to women. Congresswoman Mink's legacy lives on as, each year, hundreds of women across the Nation participate in NCAA athletics, learn teamwork and perseverance, earn scholarships enabling them to study at college,  and enjoy equal footing with men in the academic arena.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute to the women, local heroes, of my district. Women like Ramona Tolliver, long time Fifth Ward resident, former precinct chair, founding board member of Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation, member of Our Mother of Mercy Catholic Church, and member of the Metropolitan Organization, who is still actively advocating for her community. Women like Nellie Joyce Punch, long time Fifth Ward resident, retired educator at Phyllis Wheatley High School, former  precinct chair, founding board member of Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation, member of the Methodist Church, also actively working on behalf of her community. Both Ms. Tolliver and Ms. Punch are active in Houston's Fifth Ward, where they act as the conscience for the community, calling for change and actively working to better our city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women like Dr. Charlesetta Deason, principal of Houston's DeBakey High School for Health Professions. Dr. Deason helms a school that offers students interested in science and health careers an alternative to the traditional high school experience, located in the renowned Texas Medical Center and boasting an ethnically diverse faculty and an excellent introductory study of medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or women like Harris County Commissioner Sylvia Garcia, the first Hispanic and first woman to be elected in her own right to the office. Commissioner Garcia is active in the Houston community, and she has served on more than 25 community  boards and commissions, including the San Jacinto Girl Scouts, the Houston Hispanic Forum, the American Leadership Forum, the Texas Southern University Foundation, and the Institute of Hispanic Culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation, we have come a long way toward recognizing the important role women play, not only in our local communities, but in our Nation as a whole. Since 1917, when Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman to serve in Congress, 243 more women have served as U.S. Representatives or Senators. In 1968, Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to Congress; I am now proud to be one of 13 African American women serving in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we are now, for the first time, under the leadership of a woman Speaker of the House. Speaker Pelosi has led this Democratic Congress in a new direction, listening to the will of the American people, as it was clearly expressed last November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the great tragedy of women's history is that, many times, the history of women is not written down. Too often, throughout the course of history, the contributions of women have gone unrecorded, unheralded, and are now forgotten. And so, Mr. Speaker, during Women's History Month, we do not stand here only to remember the Eleanor Roosevelts, Harriet Tubmans, and Rosa Parks, women who are now celebrated in our schools and history books, but also the millions of female unsung heroes  who built this Nation, and who made it truly great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to pay special tribute to women, mothers, and grandmothers across the country. In particular, I would like to draw attention to the growing phenomenon of grandparents raising children. As of 1996, 4 million children were being raised by their grandparents, and statistics published the following year indicated that more than one-tenth of all grandparents provided the primary care for their grandchildren for at least 6 months and typically much longer. These numbers continue to grow,  and these grandparents, generally ineligible for financial or social support, often suffer greatly to provide a safe and loving home for these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Speaker, we pay tribute to the brave women who serve proudly in our Nation's military. We have come a long way since the first American woman soldier, Deborah Sampson of Massachusetts, who enlisted as a Continental Army soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtlief." Women served with distinction in World War II: 350,000 American women served during World War II, and 16 were killed in action. In total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations, and commendations. In December 1989,  CPT Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the invasion of Panama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war in Iraq marks the first time in American history that a substantial number of the combat wounded are women. 350,000 women are serving in the U.S. military--almost 15 percent of active duty personnel, and one in every seven troops in Iraq is a woman. Women play a role in nearly all types of military operation, and they have time and time again demonstrated extreme bravery, courage, and patriotism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would particularly like to honor one of our heroic daughters: Army SPC Monica L. Brown. Brown is the first woman in Afghanistan and only the second female soldier since World War II to receive the Silver Star, the Nation's third-highest medal for valor. Army SPC Monica Brown was part of a four-vehicle convoy patrolling near Jani Kheil in the eastern province of Paktia on April 25, 2007, when a bomb struck one of the Humvees. After the explosion, in which five soldiers in her unit were wounded,  Brown ran through insurgent gunfire and used her body to shield wounded comrades as mortars fell less than 100 yards away. Army Specialist Brown, a native Texan, represents the best of our Nation's fighting men and women, and she clearly demonstrates that the admirable qualities of patriotism, valor, and courage know no gender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Women's History Month is an opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the women who have built, strengthened, and maintained this great Nation.
