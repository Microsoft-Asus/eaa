    <paragraph>Mr. President, my heart goes out this morning to the families of the nine fallen firefighters in Charleston, to my colleagues Senators Graham and DeMint, and to the people of Charleston. These fallen heroes made the ultimate sacrifice to protect their fellow citizens. Today we remember them and all firefighters and their families for whom courageous service is a part of their everyday lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Massachusetts endured a similar disaster several years ago when six firefighters died in Worcester, MA. I read a poem at the funeral of those fallen heroes, and I would like to read it again now. I hope it brings some small measure of comfort to those whose hearts are aching today for their brave husbands, fathers, brothers, and friends who perished so tragically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The poem is called "May They Not Be Forgotten."</paragraph>
