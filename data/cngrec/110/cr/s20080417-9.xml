  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, for the interest of all Members, we have been working now since Monday to pass a technical corrections bill, which, it seems to me, should have been passed very quickly. It basically makes some corrections to the last big highway and transit bill so certain projects that have been held up for technical reasons can go forward, and others that weren't ready, pushed aside, and another can go forward. This will unleash about a billion dollars' worth of important programs  for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These projects have been vetted, and they have been posted on the Web page of the committee, as we must do according to our new ethics rules. We are very pleased it looks like we might be able to wrap this up in the next few hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as I am concerned, we are ready to vote. We have the Coburn amendment and the Boxer amendment, which deal with a real problem that occurred at some point during the SAFETEA-LU consideration years ago. We have corrected the problem in the bill. We want to now have some type of investigation to find out exactly what went wrong and if there were any crimes committed. There were two options. Senator Coburn is setting up a complicated select committee of the House and Senate. We believe  strongly that it creates constitutional problems, and we think it might interfere with a Justice Department investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then Senator Reid had recommended, I think a far better way to get at the problem, which is a Justice Department investigation. I have written an amendment to go along with that. We are hoping to vote on that and then, hopefully, get to a cloture vote and final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is the lay of the land, as best I see it. I wish I had more control over this at the moment. If I did, we would be voting in 5 minutes on the whole package. Until then, I will see you as soon as we have an agreement and, hopefully, we will get this matter done today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="EXTENSION OF THE FARM BILL">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am on the floor to speak about something the majority leader proposed and that we have accepted by unanimous consent; that is, a 1-week extension of existing farm policy, the existing farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the floor to speak because last night I put a hold on that UC request. I, similar to many Senators--and especially American agriculture--am growing very frustrated and restless about the reality that we don't have a farm bill. As we know, across America and in central parts of our country--certainly in the South--spring is here and it is planting season. The farm bill that is current law, which we extended a few moments ago, actually expired on September 30 of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in July 2007 that the House passed their version, and on December 14 we passed ours. Now, we have offered several extensions so the principals--the House and Senate Ag committees--could work on their differences with the administration and solve these problems. Yet they have not been able to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is this symbolic of a dysfunctional Congress that we have been experiencing for the last several years, where we simply cannot grapple with the big and responsible basic public policy issues of our country? It appears to be that way. I will blame both sides on this issue. It is both sides that are at fault that they cannot come together and, if you will, split the difference and solve a problem that is the basic public policy for American agriculture. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the  House, opposes the tax provision within the bill. Why? She isn't a member of the Finance Committee or a member of the Agriculture Committee. Yes, she is the majority leader and, therefore, if she opposes it, she could certainly block it, and she can kill farm policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with Senator Harkin and Senator SAXBY CHAMBLISS for the last month, and I know they have worked overtime. This is not a criticism of our colleagues; it is a criticism of a dysfunctional system that no longer can cut a deal and make basic and important public policy. So here we are, with one more extension. SAXBY CHAMBLISS called me this morning and said: LARRY, would you give us another week? I said I would give them 1 more week, but, frankly, this  is it; I will not accept another extension next week on the farm bill, unless the deal has been cut, unless the agreement has been made and it is simply the procedure of putting it in writing and getting it to print and to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, when he signed the extension last time, said: "Enough is enough." Even this week, he softly talked about vetoing an extension. So I guess the point I am trying to make is, what is at stake? Why are we bickering over the fine points, when the fundamental policy points are in place?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at what we have done, because we ought to be proud of the work of the new farm bill: Significant increases in conservation funding for our working farmlands, including conservation, stewardship, and environmental quality incentive programs. These are programs that encourage farmers and ranchers to incorporate better tillage practices, thereby sequestering more carbon and doing their part as it relates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have added, for our dairies, better manure  management practices to reduce methane gas emissions. Here we are talking about climate change. The President spoke to climate change yesterday. Yet we cannot come to an agreement on something that would allow American agriculture to advance their practices to make it work, in their instance, and allow a contribution to the climate change carbon emissions issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a provision within the new farm bill that I and Senator Stabenow have worked on--literally for 5 years--to get a new provision in the farm bill to recognize the near 50 percent of gross revenue coming out of agriculture today, known as specialty crops. For the first time, we have a new title on specialty crops. If I say at the end of the week--and their work is not done--I am not going to extend it any more, I am going to have to forgo this. I am going to forgo it and say to  the farmers in Idaho and across America: Let's do a 2-year extension on existing policy, or at least 1-year extension so you know where you are when you get to planting season, instead of watching Congress fall all over itself because they cannot cut a deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't it about time we settle our differences and show America we can function, that we can work the process? Have we truly become so dysfunctional and partisan on these fundamentally bipartisan issues that they simply cannot be resolved? On our side, there is a bipartisan effort. I cannot speak to the House side. I have not been in the negotiations. I can only see the results. The results simply don't exist. That is why this Senator is on the floor today speaking with considerable frustration  over why we have a Congress that, months after the expiration of the law, simply cannot get its work done. Commodity programs maintain a safety net. Yes, commodity prices are high today and farmers are profiting. What goes up clearly can, and does, come down in the commodity markets. A property safety net for wheat and barley was in there. It is extremely important we do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are nutritional program increases, making the school snack program nationwide to deal with better health, and fresh fruit availabilities for our schoolchildren. That is different and better. The disaster assistance program will help aid our farmers and ranchers in a more efficient fashion in periods of serious drought and fire and other whole farm types of disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an issue in agriculture and beef production that has been an issue of considerable contention over time. It is called country-of-origin labeling. The American consumer today, when they go to the shelf and pick up a commodity and look at it, wants to know where it comes from. Is it a domestic U.S. product or was it produced somewhere else in the world?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we have concern today about certain types of products coming out of China and other areas, and the consumer's right to know the marketing certainly is important in country-of-origin labeling. We finally acquiesced to implement country-of-origin labeling by September of this year. I don't know if we can do it if we keep shoving the farm bill out, keep extending it and not allowing the operative language to come in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are critical tax provisions within this bill. My colleague, Senator MIKE CRAPO, has an Endangered Species Act compliance in reduction and credits. There are wind energy credits and production tax credits for cellulosic ethanol. Once again, as a nation that has grown increasingly dependent on foreign energy sources, we are saying to American agriculture in this farm bill: Here are some incentives for increased production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was recently in Ottawa, Canada, looking at a cellulosic ethanol production plant, hoping it will be brought south of the border into the United States so we can begin to use agricultural residues for the purpose of making ethanol, lessening the pressure on some of our grain crops, especially our corn crops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are provisions in the bill to incentivize biodiesel. Yet those incentives are the kind Speaker Pelosi says are nonstarters, they are deal breakers. How can making our country energy independent, how can incentivizing the promotion of the Endangered Species Act within private lands and giving folks the benefit of doing that be a deal breaker? It simply demonstrates how this Congress cannot function today. We are basically on hold right now. We are not getting our work done in a  variety of areas, and agriculture and the farm bill is simply a very tragic example of that type of effort, or lack thereof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said, September 30 of last year the policy expired. Current law was extended until March 15 and then again until tomorrow, and that is why the leader was on the floor today advancing it for 1 more week so that agriculture is not without policy in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the 17th. The work has not been done. This Monday, Chairman Harkin said he was fed up. If he is fed up and he is a prime negotiator, what do we get? How do we deliver an ultimatum? I am not sure. But I am sure we will not, nor should we, allow American agriculture to be without policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the gains I have talked about, all of the gains that were negotiated inside the Senate Agriculture Committee and inside the House Agriculture Committee could simply be wiped away because there is no willingness or ability to come together and work together in behalf of American agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I agreed on a 1-week extension. This is not an ultimatum, this is simply a statement of fact. I cannot agree any longer. American agriculture and Idaho's farmers need to know. They deserve to know. They should not be kept in limbo bouncing on the end of a string because the politicians in Washington cannot get their act together and simply cannot agree. We have always come to an agreement on agriculture. It has always been a bipartisan policy. I hope that practice of the past is a practice  that ultimately can dominate the negotiations over this coming week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will keep their lights on during the weekend. It is time we work a little overtime to get this done because I am one of several Senators who are simply at a point of saying: Can't go there anymore; time to finish it; time to tell American agriculture: Here is the new policy. And if we cannot, then let's extend the old policy and give them certainty for a minimum of at least 1 year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="TANKER REPLACEMENT PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, the U.S. Air Force announced its award of the KC-45A air refueling tanker program, a replacement to the aging KC-135 fleet. The two competitors in this process were Northrop Grumman-EADS on the one hand and the Boeing Company on the other. After a 13-month-long process, the Northrop Grumman proposal was selected as the better product for the American soldier and also the better value for the American taxpayer. It should come as no surprise that  this decision amounted to a major disappointment for Boeing. Their employees and executives would understandably have appreciated the economic benefit such an award would have brought to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The award of the tanker program to Northrop Grumman was not the first setback to the Boeing Company in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress intervened, in the fiscal year 2005 Defense bill, to terminate the Air Force tanker lease agreement. This agreement would have been costly and simply bad public policy. Afterward, the Air Force responded with one of the clearest and most transparent acquisition processes in history. The Air Force is now able to purchase and own 179 KC-45s for the same price it was going to spend to lease 100 Boeing 767s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compared to the reactions in States where Boeing has a presence, the selection of Northrop Grumman was greeted with enthusiasm in Mobile, AL, and along the gulf coast of my State of Mississippi, where thousands of jobs will be created locally. The tankers will be built in Mobile, but the economic impact will be felt throughout the gulf coast and, in reality, throughout the Nation. Such is the nature of the competitive process. One contestant is selected, and the other must deal with disappointing  news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important for Senators to understand that the Air Force and the Defense Department utilized an extremely fair and open acquisition process. The Government requested and received proposals for the tanker in early 2007 and then continued with an open review process until Northrop Grumman was announced as the winner in February of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In winning this contract, Northrop Grumman simply did a better analysis and provided a better solution for the Air Force. The KC-45A carries more fuel, more passengers, and more cargo. It will also cost less to produce, passing along savings to the American taxpayers. By utilizing a broad base of suppliers in 49 of our 50 States, the Northrop Grumman tanker will create 48,000 direct and indirect jobs across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this, some want to stop this process from going forward. I have been disturbed by the words and actions of Boeing and its supporters. The level of misinformation injected into this process with the clear intent of derailing the award is troubling for many reasons--not the least of which is the precedent that would be set by Congress should it overturn this decision. The Air Force should be allowed to make this acquisition decision based solely on the facts and the merits of the two competing  proposals, and that is exactly what it did in choosing the Northrop Grumman tanker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at some of the claims made by Boeing and its supporters--first, that the competition was somehow unfair. The Air Force and the Defense Department testified recently to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the KC-45A tanker competition was perhaps the most rigorous, fair, and transparent acquisition in DOD history. This open process allowed for a significant amount of dialog among the Air Force, the Department of Defense, and the two bidders. This included weekly teleconferences  with the Air Force, which, during the review process, sent Northrop Grumman 295 evaluation notices. They sent approximately 250 notices to Boeing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, following the formal request for proposals in January 2007, the Air Force received no complaints from Boeing or anyone else that the proposal request was somehow unfair. There were ample opportunities for those concerns to be aired, but no one said a word in this regard. Considering this, it is very hard to make a straight-faced claim that the process was not open or fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has also been a high level of misinformation about the so-called exportation of American jobs. Some erroneously claim the Northrop Grumman award will outsource thousands of U.S. jobs to Europe. This is simply not true. No jobs are being exported to Europe. On the contrary, the KC-45A will create thousands of new jobs in America and will support a total of 48,000 direct and indirect jobs in 49 States, as I have said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 230 suppliers across the United States helped make up the 60 percent U.S. content in the KC-45A tanker. This will truly be America's tanker, assembled in America by American workers and for the protection of the American military. The KC-45A will be fully assembled and militarized for U.S. Air Force operations by American workers in two separate facilities in Mobile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No sensitive military technology will be exported to Europe in connection with this program. Instead, a new aerospace corridor will continue to grow and flourish along the gulf coast region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The KC-45A tanker will join the Global Hawk, Fire Scout, joint cargo aircraft, and the light utility helicopter production facilities that are already successfully producing high-reliability defense systems for our Nation. The light utility helicopter, for example, is being built by EADS North America in Columbus, MS. It is a true success for the Army and for our economy. The Lakota, as the helicopter is known, was delivered to the Army 3 months ahead of schedule. To date, 24 Lakota helicopters  have been delivered on or ahead of schedule. The Lakota has over 2,000 flight hours, with over a 90-percent full mission capable rate. In addition, EADS North America completed a 314,000-square-foot expansion to its Mississippi facility to manufacture this</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There should be no doubt that the workforce in the gulf coast region is up to the task of building these complex systems. The results to date on the systems I just mentioned speak for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our workforce is second to none in the Nation. So this debate, as much as some would make you believe otherwise, is not about American jobs versus European jobs. It is about where in the United States those jobs will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent full-page ad in newspapers across the country represented the worst of the misinformation. The ad claimed the Air Force selection "penalized the warfighter and the taxpayer."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The facts tell another story. The KC-45A was evaluated to be a superior product for the warfighter. It was also judged by the Air Force to be a better value for the taxpayer, providing superior military capability across the board at a lower total cost than the competing KC-767 aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Air Force is not alone in choosing the KC-45A. Our friend and ally, the United Kingdom, recently announced the selection of this same aircraft frame as the best solution to meet their national security requirements. The U.K. selection is the fifth tanker competition in a row where the EADS platform was chosen as the winner over all other competitors. Australia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have also recently placed orders for this tanker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some are calling for tighter restrictions on the level of international content in U.S. defense systems. That, to my mind, would be a mistake and would amount to changing the rules in the middle of the game. The U.S. economy is tightly integrated into the global economy, and the aerospace sector is no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are numerous examples of transatlantic cooperation on vital U.S. military programs where foreign suppliers do play essential roles. Some of the more visible programs include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter produced by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and British Aerospace; the VH-71 Presidential helicopter produced by Lockheed Martin and Augusta Westland, a European consortium; and the Joint Cargo Aircraft produced by L-3, Boeing, and Alenia, built in Florida from an Italian airframe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't recall anyone in this Chamber or from Boeing expressing concern about the level of European participation in the Joint Cargo Aircraft, which has only about 60 percent U.S. content, nor did anyone complain about possible interruption of supplies of spare parts, which some have suggested would be a likely outcome of buying the KC-45A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To repeat, Boeing's Joint Cargo Aircraft is 60 percent U.S. content and 40 percent international. When this contract was awarded, no one raised a single complaint about that. Now, when Boeing loses a competition to a partnership with a similar domestic-foreign ratio, they make it sound as if the world is coming to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me the level of noise depends on whose ox is being gored. I  must stress this point. Any further delay of this contract would put at risk the brave Americans flying the current Air Force fleet of KC-135 tankers. These aircraft, on average, are more than 45 years old. Replacement has been the Air Force's top modernization priority for several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the GAO upholds the Air Force selection and denies Boeing's protest, that should be the end of it. At that point, no Member of this body should stand in the way of the program moving ahead. Any further efforts to delay the program would not only be harmful to our national security but would be viewed by many of our foreign partners and allies as a major shift in U.S. policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From an economic point of view, potential retaliation by our European allies could have a negative impact on the current $6 billion in annual purchases of defense systems from the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to acknowledge that Boeing has every right to protest this decision to the Government Accountability Office. Beyond that, however, if this decision is not overturned by GAO, any attempt to alter this decision through the appropriations process or any other legislative maneuver would be dangerously shortsighted, in my opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would set a damaging precedent that would destroy our contract process now and in the future. Frankly, I would view such a move as an attack on the competition process itself, not only this award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The workers along the gulf coast in Alabama and Mississippi and this entire corridor are ready to proceed with this work for our national defense. We would all do well to step back and let the facts in this situation speak for themselves. That is what the Air Force did when choosing the Northrop Grumman tanker as the best option for our warfighters' terms and the American taxpayer and their decision should be allowed to stand.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="GAS TAX RELIEF">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, about almost 24 hours ago I had asked the chairman of the committee about offering an amendment to this legislation. It is clear that as a result of the agreement that has been worked out and the filing of cloture and so on that it is not going to be possible to get a vote on the amendment I was speaking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to talk briefly about that amendment and indicate that it would be offered on behalf of Senator McCain, my colleague from Arizona, as well as other Senators, some of whom may want to also speak to it briefly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know gasoline prices have risen dramatically. And the amendment Senator McCain and I and others would offer would provide a temporary tax holiday from Memorial Day to Labor Day, preventing the Federal Government from collecting the 18.4-percent tax, the gasoline tax, that otherwise motorists would pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I assure my colleagues that the highway trust fund, which that tax goes into, would be kept whole with Federal revenues from the General Treasury. So the money we use to build highways and bridges and so on would not be affected by this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Briefly, I think we all feel the pinch when we fill up our cars and trucks. But listen to these statistics. According to economy.com, gasoline prices at the pump have increased from $2.22 to $3.33 a gallon, up 50 percent since the start of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I checked in my home State of Arizona yesterday. It was $3.38. There is very little that Congress can do in the near term to reduce gas prices other than this gas tax holiday. In the long term, we know we have to add more production and refining capacity in our country and that we have to encourage supplies to increase. But for right now, the one thing that Congress can do, and do virtually immediately, is to provide this short-term relief from the Federal gas tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At $3.33 a gallon, prices are the highest on record. Nearly 50 cents of the cost of each gallon of gas is due to taxes. According to the Bureau of Labor Statics 2005 Consumer Expenditure Survey, families with two cars spent, on average, $2,013 on gasoline. Since that study was released prices have increased dramatically. Gasoline price increases imply families are now paying at least $3,065 on gasoline in a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A big chunk of that is Federal, State, and local taxes. In fact, the average family pays nearly $170 in Federal gas taxes. With the growing financial strains placed on so many Americans' rising food prices and falling home prices, the additional hit of rising fuel prices is becoming a breaking point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my colleague, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, talked about the need to do something, and do something quickly, and proposed this gas tax holiday in comments he made to the Nation a couple of days ago, and why he has asked this amendment be introduced on his behalf, as well as Senators WARNER, BURR, MARTINEZ, LIEBERMAN, and GRAHAM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to ease some of the hardship caused by the higher fuel prices that I have indicated, the amendment would merely suspend the 18.4-percent-per-gallon tax on gas and the 24.4-percent tax on diesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, the amendment would not deplete the highway trust fund balance. The amendment would offset any revenue loss from the suspension of this tax with Treasury revenues. So the highway trust found will remain whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all agree that our roads and highways must be maintained to ensure the safety of the road-traveling public, and this amendment would in no way impact highway construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting, last Memorial Day alone, approximately 32 million Americans traveled by car 50 miles or more from home. So suspending the Federal excise tax during the summer when fuel prices have historically been at their highest level would allow millions of Americans to keep a few more of their hard-earned dollars and help them better make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two final comments: There is an argument that this loss should be offset somehow by programs raising taxes somewhere else. Of course, I have never understood why, if you are going to provide tax relief to Americans, you would want to provide the tax relief and then tax them in some other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office, former Council of Economic Advisers, Chairman Martin Feldstein, and Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin are three of the entities or individuals who have said it is unnecessary to offset temporary tax cuts when an economy is slowing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $150 billion stimulus bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 81 to 16  in early February was not offset. The $15 billion-plus housing bill that passed the Senate 84 to 12 last week was not offset. Most of the revenue losses associated with the housing bill benefited companies and other businesses, not consumers. If offsets were not needed to offset the benefit to private firms, I ask why our amendment would need to be offset since it aids struggling  American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I heard rumors that Senators would like to propose an alternative to what we have produced, a Democratic alternative that was developed yesterday afternoon, that would effectively raise corporate income taxes on oil and gas companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I suppose everyone likes to pick on oil and gas companies, though we sure want to have some gasoline in the pumps when we decide we need to fill up our cars and trucks, but this proposal eliminates or curtails the so-called section 199 domestic production deduction for oil and gas companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What that means in regular English is effectively raising the corporate income tax rate by 3 percentage points. That is exactly the wrong medicine at a time when our economy is not doing well. Let me repeat that. The elimination of this tax incentive is designed to encourage oil and gas companies to produce oil and gas in the United States so we do not have to go abroad and buy it from somewhere else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't agree with this approach. Rather than raising taxes on oil companies, we should be encouraging them to explore for oil and to produce oil and gas in the United States, to improve our energy security and, importantly, to reduce prices for American consumers. Why on Earth would anyone actually want to limit domestic production? Reducing domestic production would only make the United States more dependent on foreign oil imports and would likely cause consumers to pay even more at the pump.  Besides, a tax increase of the type being proposed would have the effect of raising prices at the pump, as costs obviously would be passed on to consumers. That would obviously have a reverse impact, the exact opposite of what we are trying to do with a reduction of the gas tax on consumers of gasoline products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there is a significant problem with the proposal to repeal section 199 for U.S. oil companies. A proposal to do this passed the House of Representatives earlier this year. But this very same provision that passed the House would have the effect of keeping the 199 tax incentive for CITGO, the oil company owned by the Venezuelan Government; obviously, not a good idea while we are repealing it for American companies, to leave that tax incentive for a competitor of our oil companies owned  by the Venezuelan Government. I don't know whether that was unintentional, but that is the effect of the amendment. Clearly that is not something we would want to do. I don't think we want to hold consumer relief hostage to a tax increase.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague, because we need to move this bill along. There are 500 important projects in it. I have colleagues who want to add more projects. I want to say, for the benefit of everyone, there are some very legitimate technical corrections that still need to be done. I have committed to my colleagues, both Democratic and Republican--I have spoken to Senator Lincoln, Senator Landrieu, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Hutchison,  only a few moments ago--that our committee, myself working with Senator Inhofe and our colleagues, is going to come up with a follow-on technical corrections bill with the time to ensure it is put together right. We do have some different ethics</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I read a very complex unanimous consent request, and I don't think anyone within the sound of my voice could possibly follow all of it. So I thought in plain English, for the good of myself as well as my colleagues, I would say where we are. We are going to have a couple of votes on the issue of Coconut Road, which is a real problem for us, and it has been straightened out in this bill. We fix the problem. But there are colleagues who want to have an investigation, and we have two alternatives.  One is the Coburn amendment which sets up what I consider a very complicated special select committee with Members from both bodies. It will have public hearings. It will review things in public. It will do all of that. At the end of that time, what the committee will do is refer something to Justice, if they have found a problem. That is the whole point of the select committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, if you read the Constitution, you see the debate clause. We believe, from our constitutional scholars on this side, that that whole committee will fall. It will not be able to do its job. The House has told us they don't see how Senators can investigate House Members and House Members can investigate Senate Members. We think the best way to go, Senator Reid and I and others, is to have the Justice Department get right in there. Ours is not a sense-of-the-Senate approach.  We require the Justice Department to move forward. Instead of having a big Senate-House committee, with the press flashing pictures and all the rest, just get to it and ask Justice to investigate. We also worry, if there is a big committee--and there won't be, because the House won't accept it anyway--irony of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will reject that approach and support the Boxer-Reid approach which I believe is straightforward. It makes sense. It gets right to the heart. If there is a crime, let's find out about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the McCain amendment, I actually was looking forward to debating it. I hope we will be able to, because there is a lot of dispute about how it would actually work in the real world. There is nothing in the McCain amendment that tells the oil companies they can't pocket the 18 cents that  is going to come off. We have seen the oil companies. In California, in some places, we are over $4. This hurts our hearts. We see oil company profits soaring. If it were only the cost, they would be having the same profit and passing on the cost. But, no, their profits have gone up. We know about the CEO salaries and all the rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing in the McCain amendment--I would love to talk to JOHN about that--that would say to the oil companies: Don't use this as a moment to raise 18 cents. So where might we be?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We might do this, and we would have to now go to the general fund. All taxpayers would have to pay for this. Let's be clear. There is no pay-for in the McCain amendment--none at all. It goes to the Treasury. Who puts money in the Treasury? My taxpayers, your taxpayers, all taxpayers. So taxpayers are now going to pay for this one way or the other. We take it away from the users and the taxpayers pay, and there is nothing in it that will ensure that the cost won't be nabbed and grabbed by the  oil companies. Then they get the extra 18 cents, and we have blown a $9 billion hole in the Federal budget. It is amazing how my colleagues could say, it is a time of stress. We have to do this. We need to be a little bit more responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to this debate. I like to pay for things. Maybe I am old-fashioned. I am an old economics major. I think it is good to pay for things. I think we could figure out a way to pay for things. But to say nobody gets hurt when the tab in the McCain amendment is picked up by all taxpayers is faulty. We will have to make up that $9 billion. We Democrats think there is a way to do it. We see the profits of the oil companies. We say to the oil companies: Good for you, but there is  a point at which, when Americans are suffering, you have to do a little bit more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, look forward to debating the McCain amendment soon. We will have that debate. But it isn't going to be on this bill. For that, I am grateful for this reason: We are bringing this to a close, and this package is in many ways a ministimulus. It will unleash $1  billion into the economy. It will unleash some of these projects that are so important for our people who got stuck for technical reasons or had to have minor changes for other reasons.  This $1 billion, when it is unleashed, will create tens of thousands of good jobs, jobs building highways, bridges, transit systems. We are very happy, and we expect to have this vote at 3:30. We will have first the Boxer amendment, then the Coburn amendment, then a cloture vote, and then a vote on final passage. We should be doing very well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are a lot of things going on in Washington that people probably don't understand and wonder about. How could my Government not do better than it is doing. This is one of the areas where most people understand what we are trying to do and would appreciate any effort on their behalf to accomplish relieving the gas tax for a period of time when a lot of Americans are traveling. If you believe that a $600 check to Americans that comes from the Treasury, that is not  offset, is a good thing to help the economy, like 81 of us do, this builds on that concept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from California asks what we are trying to do. We are trying to build on some concepts that have already passed the body. We are injecting the economy with money so that people, consumers can buy more to help stimulate the economy. We have all agreed on that being a good idea. What is this doing? This is trying to take a Federal tax that affects every American who drives a car during a window of time when many Americans are going to be on the road doing a lot of things they have looked  forward to and planned, to reduce the burden of traveling, to energize the economy, whether it is in terms of recreational travel or business dealings. That will build on the concept we have already agreed on. Now is the time to put money back into the pockets of consumers, and relieving the gas tax during this critical time and during this window of time makes perfect sense. I congratulate Senators MCCAIN and KYL. This will not be a hard sell to anybody out there who is paying taxes and driving a car. I hope we can find a way</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, being from South Carolina and Florida and Mississippi, where people travel to destinations that are attractive to come to, I hope we can pass this and help the American consumer.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague from South Carolina. I understand where we are. This amendment has been withdrawn. However, let me touch on this issue for a few moments, because it is so very important that we give this concept due consideration. In fact, at some point, the Senate should give it an up-or-down vote. A gas tax holiday from Memorial Day to Labor Day, which has a number of cosponsors, would allow American taxpayers to suspend the gas tax during that  period of time. The fact is we are not in easy times in America today. We have rising gas prices, falling home prices, which is resulting in falling home equity opportunities for families to utilize their home as a means of defraying other costs in their family's life. As food prices go up, home prices are going down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of gasoline has gone up tremendously. Unleaded regular has increased 53 cents per gallon this year. As a matter of fact, a tax holiday of 18 cents a gallon gas tax and 24 cents a gallon on diesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day will help American families, will help those who make a living driving on the road, moving and hauling things through the trucking industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is it important to me as a Senator from Florida? We are a tourism State. A lot of tourists travel to Florida by car. In fact, the overwhelming majority of tourists come to Florida by car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the average working family--the same people we are trying to help with this economic stimulus. This is allowing a family to throw their kids in the car and get on one of the interstate highways and come down to Florida and visit the attractions, visit the beaches this summer, and do what people do to bring families together, to be able to recreate, to be able to vacation as families together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an economic stimulus to the State of Florida. The State of Florida is in hard times today because of the downdraft in the housing economy. So this would act as a tremendous boost, and it would help tremendously the families who are traveling in Florida and coming to Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gas is about $3.38 a gallon for regular in the State of Florida right now. It is a 51-cent increase from what it was a year ago. We get about 75 million tourists a year who come to the State of Florida. As a result of that, a great deal of economic activity is generated. Over the course of a year, about 25 million families are paying an additional $68 million in Federal gas tax for just one fill-up. That is on top of the fluctuating prices for a barrel of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, we have to recognize this is an opportunity to provide a stimulus to our economy, to help the Florida economy, and to help the American family to be able to vacation this summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Treasury would transfer funds under this amendment to make the highway trust fund whole. So, in other words, it is not going to create a hole in the highway trust fund. It will not mean a diminution in our commitment to maintaining our infrastructure. It is simply going to give families a break between Memorial Day and Labor Day. What a great thing. What a great time of year. For the 4th of July we know millions of American families are going to set to the road--hopefully, set  to the road--if they do not have to break to their kids the bad news because of the situation today. Because of difficult family budgets, that kitchen table conversation may also include saying: Children, guess what. We have to cancel our vacation to Florida this summer. We can't afford to take the family car. The price of gas is too high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would be a way to give the American family a break.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take a moment and comment on something else. The distinguished Senator from California, Chairman Boxer, commented on the issue of Coconut Road. It is in my State of Florida. I am very concerned about what occurred in the situation there, which I think is well known to my colleagues in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, what happened here is, at best, a questionable procedure. So the reason for Senator Coburn's amendment, which I have cosponsored, and Senator Nelson has cosponsored--so it is a bipartisan amendment--is to try to get at the bottom of it. It is not to try to create a Justice Department investigation. I do not know if there is any criminal wrongdoing that has taken place. These are congressional actions which are, frankly, in many ways reprehensible in my view but  which may not rise to criminality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the issue is, why not just investigate? Let's find out: How did this happen? Because what I would hope we would all want to do is prevent this from happening in the future. Do we need to change rules, do we need to change procedures, or do we need to simply allow the public to know who did something like this and what their motivations were? I am not sure it rises to criminality. That is what the Justice Department does. They investigate criminal conduct. I do think it rises to the level of  conduct that is not becoming to public officials that is not designed to enhance the public trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of southwest Florida, who have tremendous traffic problems--that I-75 is dramatically important to  their lives, frankly, as to the cost of fuel, the cost of how much time they spend idling on the highways--want to know what occurred here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I want to do is allow, through this process, to provide some clarity so they can know some answers. I believe the Coburn amendment is appropriate. I do not want to see this be created into some inquisition by the Justice Department but simply to get some Members to come together around a table and say: How did this happen? What happened here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's give the people of southwest Florida the kind of answers they deserve, they demand, and give confidence to the American people that the Congress is acting in the people's best interests and not at the behest of special interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on both of these items, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will do my best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain and Senator Kyl for putting forward this proposal. I was delighted to see it. I would, frankly, hope that Democrats and Republicans could come together on this issue in a bipartisan manner and provide this temporary relief for hard-pressed Americans during the summer months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people ask us, why are gas prices so high? Why is this continuing to happen? As we know, there are many complex factors involved in that: worldwide demand, countries such as China and India increasing their demand for oil and gas at this point; also, unstable governments in oil-producing regions; and Americans' continued reliance on foreign sources of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, also, I must confess the problem being experienced by Americans, in large measure, is due to Federal policies. In the mid-1990s, President Clinton vetoed a proposal to drill in ANWR, even though the residents of the State of Alaska have asked us for permission to drill there and have told us they are satisfied it can be done in an environmentally friendly manner. Also, we have had the refusal to produce energy in America when we know it can be done in an environmentally safe way, whether  that be the production of more crude oil, oil shale, or liquefied coal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Federal Government and this Congress bear a good bit of the responsibility. In light of that, I think we have to ask ourselves--Mr. President, might I have an additional 1 1/2  minutes?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this Senate--Republicans and Democrats--needs to ask: We have a choice. Do we ask the Federal Government to tighten its belt a bit and adopt this summer-long Federal gasoline tax holiday or do we continue to require American families to tighten their belts and pay higher gasoline prices? Do we continue to require American farmers and small businesses, who have to use transportation to earn a living, to tighten their belts?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the better answer there is to provide 18 cents per gallon of relief for American families, 24 cents per gallon of relief to those who are required to use diesel to earn their livelihoods, and for the Federal Government to tighten its belt and absorb this $8 billion to $9 billion that the Senator from California talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from South Carolina mentioned we have already passed a much more expensive economic stimulus measure because we are concerned about the economy. This economy could go either way. We can take action to prevent it from sliding into a recession. We have already adopted one a few months ago. The McCain plan is another one. I enthusiastically support the concept. I think it is time we give Americans a break at the pump. This would do so during an important period as our economy teeters  on the edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we continue to have this debate, as the Senator from California suggested, and adopt it on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate must act to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and we must do so now. The House has already acted on this bill to restore the basic protection against pay discrimination as part of our Nation's commitment to equal justice and full civil rights for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting these fundamental rights and ending discrimination in all forms are essential to our success as a nation. Republicans and Democrats worked together to enact our civil rights laws, and the American people want and deserve these protections to be implemented in full.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The guarantee of equal pay was first enacted in 1963. When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, he emphasized that protection against pay discrimination is "basic to democracy," and those words are still true today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years that followed, Congress passed other strong, bipartisan laws to strengthen the guarantee of equal pay for millions of Americans. Over the years, the Senate has gone on record time and again in favor of fairness and against discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted after long, difficult, and contentious debate, but the cause of justice eventually prevailed. That landmark legislation included many important protections, including, for the first time, protection against pay discrimination on the job because of race, national origin, gender, and religion. That is title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Public accommodations is another very major part of that legislation. But title VII provided these kinds of protections  against discrimination. That legislation passed 73 to 27.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We went on record again when the Age Discrimination in Employment Act was passed in 1967, with unanimous support in the Senate. Equal pay for those who are older; you are not going to be able to discriminate against the elderly. It was passed unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The consensus in favor of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which outlaws discrimination based on disability in federally funded programs and activities, was so strong it passed the Senate by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us are familiar with the fact that if there is going to be a dispute or major differences, people are going to call for a rollcall vote, even if there is going to be only a handful of people against it. In this situation, with regard to fair pay, equal pay, in the areas of those people who are working with the disabled, the guarantee was going to be fair pay. It, effectively, in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, passed the Senate by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, the Senate passed the Americans with Disabilities Act 91 to 6, and it was signed into law by the first President Bush. The first President Bush has stated--and I have heard him eloquently say it was the most important piece of legislation that passed and he signed into law. It had protections against discriminating against those who are disabled individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 by an overwhelming margin of 93 to 5. That was a clear vote in favor of fairness. It too was signed into law by the current President's father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this chart is the list where the Senate has addressed this issue of equal pay for equal work. Going back to 1963, these are the different Presidents who signed legislation--including President Johnson, President Nixon, President Reagan, President Bush. Look at the overwhelming votes: a clear indication of what the intention has been by this Congress in terms of fairness and justice, and correctly so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each time we have considered the issue, the Senate has taken the high road. Once again, we must demonstrate that we mean what we say. These important laws established the bedrock principle of equal pay for equal work, and they have made our Nation a stronger and better and fairer land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these times of economic hardship, working people deserve more than ever the chance to earn a fair day's pay for an honest day's work. Yet, as a result of the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision--5 to 4: one vote--last May in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company, more American workers will have to endure pay discrimination, without the means to stop it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me show what is happening with regard to women at the present time. We have serious economic challenges we are facing today. But look at the overall economic challenges, the downturn in our economy, and how it is playing out in terms of women. Women's earnings are falling faster than men's. We all hear about the falling of purchasing power among working families across this country. We can see it is falling a good deal faster in terms of the decline in median wages in the year 2007 for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, this legislation also applies in terms of African Americans, the disability community, age discrimination, national origin quotas--all of them. Look what is happening with the current economic crisis. Minorities are hit hardest by the economic downturn. So we have the economic downturn going on, and we have this decision which said the employers are going to be able to discriminate against workers on the basis of race, gender, national origin. It is unbelievable that a Supreme  Court of the United States, 5 to 4, would overturn 5 to 6 major pieces of legislation that were decided overwhelmingly by this body over a 30-year period which say we want equal pay for equal work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list goes on. We know, basically, women make 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. That is existing. These are the current data of the U.S. census in 2007. So this is the current situation, generally. What we are trying to do is change this; to get equal pay for equal work. But inherently, this is where we are in 2007, and unless we change this, it is going to continue or probably even grow worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is reflected, as we would expect, in family income. This chart shows we are talking about equal pay for women, and this legislation also applies to African Americans and national origin. Here we have African-American men receiving 21 percent less pay than White men. We find the same for Latinos. They are affected by this decision as well. Latinos receive 72 cents for every dollar earned by White workers. This shows the distinction, the annual distinction, about $8,000 a year. This has been  true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we know we are facing a difficult economic time. We also know the people who suffer the most are the people--whether it is women, whether it is African Americans, whether it is Latino, whether it is disability or whether it is elderly, all those groups are affected by the Ledbetter decision, and in the face of 30 years of this Congress saying time and time and time again, in a bipartisan way, we are going to insist on equality of pay for equal work. That is the issue. That had been the law.  This legislation we are talking about with Ledbetter, we are trying to go back to what the law was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart indicates--the light green is what we would go back to, and the dark green is where the EEOC held the same as we are proposing in this legislation. This had worked and worked effectively. That is why the CBO said this isn't any further additional burden on industry or business. We are going to hear that argument. We have the CBO study which says that, because basically most employers want to do the right thing. They understand it, they respect it, and they want to do the right thing.  So they are not going to be penalized; it will be others who will be penalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this final point, as I mentioned the different groups affected, this shows pay discrimination hurts all kinds of Americans. This orange depicts the disabled, this is national origin, 760. These are cases of pay discrimination charges, including 2,470 in terms of the gender; and on race, 2,352; on age discrimination, 978. So this is 7,000--these are the cases that are brought. Most estimates are it is in the hundreds of thousands of actual cases that are out there that people don't know about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lilly Ledbetter didn't know about the fact that she was being shortchanged for years and years and years because people keep the payroll secret. Finally, she hears from others who are working and who are doing comparable work, and she gradually puts it together that she has been shortchanged. Sure enough, she had been shortchanged for years and years and years. The local jury made the decision to pay the damages and the Supreme Court overruled it and said: You are out of luck, Lilly Ledbetter.  You should have brought your case within 180 days of the time you were employed. Even though you didn't know about it, you still should have brought it. Even if you didn't know about it, tough luck. You have no remedies. No remedies. No remedies. It has been going on for years. None. That is fundamentally and basically wrong, and that is what we are changing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have very strong support for this legislation. We have the support of various groups, including the American Association of People With Disabilities; the AARP, obviously, because of discrimination of the elderly; Business and Professional Women, the NAACP, United Auto Workers, National Congress of Black Women, the Religious Action Center, U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. They understand it and see it. The list goes on. I will include a more complete list with my remarks for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people give speeches on fairness and the need to help people in these tough economic times. An important way we can do so is by proving we still stand strongly against pay discrimination, that we would not allow the rights workers thought they had to be undone by misguided court decisions. Fair treatment for all employees is especially important now. As I mentioned, our faltering economy is hitting working families hard. There were 230,000 jobs lost in the first 3 months of this year. Unemployment  rates climbed. Over 1 million working men and women have joined the unemployed since this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few doubt that we are now in a serious recession. It has been particularly hard on women and minorities and on workers--particularly hard. Of the 80,000 jobs that were lost in this last month, 50,000 were construction workers. The unemployment rate among women has risen sharply in the past year. Minorities are suffering more. Unemployment for African Americans is now well over 9 percent, almost twice the national average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of unfair pay practices is staggering. Today, as I mentioned, women still earn 23 percent less than men; African Americans, 21 percent less than White men; and Latinos earn 72 cents for every dollar paid to White workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the financial security of all working men and women is undermined by this recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Workers are suffering already, and millions increasingly find their paychecks do not go far enough. They don't deserve to bear the additional burden of discrimination in their pay. The cost of this discrimination becomes more and more intolerable over time. Lilly Ledbetter lost tens of thousands of dollars over the course of her career because every paycheck made the burden of the discrimination even greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that the Supreme Court's decision in the Ledbetter case has left employees without one of the fundamental protections against pay discrimination that Congress intended them to have. The Court decision undermined their ability to hold employers accountable for such discrimination by imposing serious and unnecessary obstacles to ending the discrimination against them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Ledbetter case, the time limit for filing of pay discrimination claim begins to run, as I mentioned, when an employer decides to discriminate--not when the worker finds out about the discriminatory paycheck. Employers who conceal their illegal action for 180 days are free to discriminate. They can pay women less than men. They can pay African Americans less than Whites. They can pay older Americans less than younger ones and pay religious minorities and persons with disabilities less  than other workers. These employees can never, ever obtain relief. Paycheck after paycheck can keep implementing the discrimination, and workers have no way to hold employers accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, the decision has opened up a flagrant loophole in our civil rights, and the Congress cannot let it stand. Under this bill, the 180-day clock restarts with every discriminatory paycheck, so employees can challenge ongoing discrimination, even if their employer successfully hides its true motives at first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lilly Ledbetter was one of the few women supervisors at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Gadsen,  AL. She worked at the plant for almost two decades, constantly fighting to prove that women could do a job traditionally done by men. She endured insults from her male supervisors. She was told the plant didn't need women. Yet she persevered and gave the company a fair day's work. She had children and both she and her husband were working hard to support  them. She had no idea Goodyear was not living up to its responsibility to pay her fairly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost two decades, the company discriminated against her by using discriminatory evaluations to pay her less than her male colleagues who performed exactly the same duties. Many of those male colleagues had less seniority and experience than she had, but they were still paid more than she was for identical work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The jury saw the injustice of Goodyear's mistreatment of Ms. Ledbetter and awarded her full damages. Five members of the Supreme Court ignored that injustice and ruled Ms. Ledbetter was entitled to nothing at all--nothing at all--because she filed her claim too late. The Court's decision gives countless employers a free hand to conceal and continue illegal discrimination and leaves workers powerless to stop it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan Fair Pay Restoration Act will restore the clear intent of Congress when we passed the important laws I mentioned earlier. It would restore the fair and reasonable rule that applied in the vast majority of the country until May 29 of last year. If we pass this bill, we can go back to the longstanding rule that the clock begins to run for filing a pay discrimination claim on the day a worker receives a discriminatory paycheck, rather than the day the employer first decides to discriminate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By enacting this law, we will restore a rule that reflects how pay discrimination actually occurs in the workplace, and it will give all workers a fair means to stop ongoing discrimination and obtain fair compensation for the discrimination they have endured. By doing so, we will also be helping to prevent employers from engaging in such discrimination in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing radical about the changes this bill will make. It simply restores the law employers and workers had lived with for many years, until last May 29, the date of the Supreme Court's distressing decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring the full strength of the antipay discrimination laws we have enacted in the past. Let's take a clear stand for all working men and women and pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe I have an obligation to say a few things about the amendments offered by Senators COBURN and BOXER regarding the investigation of the Coconut Road controversy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As most of my colleagues know, there are reports that a Member of the House of Representatives arranged to have the text of the 2005 highway bill changed during the enrolling process, which is quite unusual. This was after the bill had passed both Houses. Serious allegations have been made about the motives of this Member for doing this. The facts are not certain, but some say they are clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The junior Senator from Oklahoma has done an important service by shining public attention on this matter. The facts are not yet all known, as I have just said, but if these allegations--or some of them--are true, this is one more example of the corruption that permeated the Congress in recent years. We have two Members of Congress who have gone to prison. We have staff members who are in prison. Some are on probation and have pled guilty. So it is fair to say there was a lot of corruption in  recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last year, the new Democratic Congress passed <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the most sweeping lobbying reform effort in the history of our country, in an effort to restore public trust in Congress. These reforms are already changing the way business is done in Washington. Lobbyists have less influence, and there is more transparency in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all agree that any misconduct in the legislative process should be fully investigated. Specifically, we want to get to the bottom of this alleged misconduct involving the Coconut Road provision in the 2005 highway bill. The only disagreement between Senators COBURN and BOXER is how the investigation should be conducted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, an investigation of the conduct of a Member of the House of Representatives should be done by the House. I think we get ourselves into a problem we should not, constitutionally or morally, by having the House tell us what we should do as far as our own Senators. We should not be telling them what they should be doing regarding House Members. Our Constitution does not provide the Senate with authority to direct a House committee to initiate any kind of action like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coburn amendment proposes a committee of Members from both the House and Senate conduct this investigation. But I believe Senators should not and cannot investigate a House Member any more than a House Member should or could investigate a Senator. Although Senator Coburn's goal of fully investigating the incident is worthy--and I think everyone shares his goal--the Senator's amendment is at odds with article I of the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we send this constitutionally dubious amendment to the House, it could jeopardize the entire highway technical corrections bill. Why do we want to mess with that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not. That is why Senator Boxer has proposed that the Justice Department review the allegations of criminal misconduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would want everyone to recognize that in law, there is this saying: What are you trying to do, make a Federal case out of it? Why do we say that? Because it puts the fear into people because they know the Justice Department does a better job than anyone else investigating wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what Senator Boxer proposed is to let the Department of Justice review the allegation of criminal conduct, which is the right way to go, and it is not an easy way to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to public reports, the Justice Department and the FBI may already be investigating related matters, and who knows, maybe this precise matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If violations of Federal criminal law occur, it is in the province of the Justice Department and FBI to investigate and prosecute. The Boxer amendment simply calls on the Justice Department to review allegations of impropriety and find if Federal criminal laws have been broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Boxer amendment asks the Justice Department to act in an appropriate manner. In fact, to be precise, it says the Department "shall act consistent with applicable standards and procedures." In effect, we are asking that this be made a Federal case. This phrase recognizes the importance of separation of powers that we have in our great country. The language incorporates the principles, privileges, and responsibilities that guide Congress's exercise of its constitutional authority to discipline  itself. It also remains true to the principles of legislative autonomy and fair, neutral enforcement of the laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does not waive any legislative privileges of Members or committees of Congress. It does not seek to intrude upon the constitutional duty of each House of Congress to discipline its own Members, nor does it alter the duty of the executive branch to faithfully execute laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment simply memorializes the reality that there are serious allegations that may rise, perhaps to the level of criminal violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, what we are trying to do is make a Federal case out of this. It is entirely appropriate for the Justice Department to assume this responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer amendment and oppose the Coburn amendment. I express my appreciation to Senator Boxer for her hard work on this bill and certainly on this amendment. Those of us who know Senator Boxer know how tenacious she is. We have had the good fortune to work together for almost 26 years in Congress. I have the greatest affection, admiration, and respect for her as a person and her legislative skills and abilities. They certainly  have been made very apparent with the work done on this latest piece of work which we hope will be completed in an hour or so from right now.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT">
    <paragraph>Madam President, before the majority leader leaves the floor, I thank him very much because he helped me enormously in this whole matter of an investigation. What we all want to do is get to the bottom of what happened with this Coconut Road situation, where it appears as if there may have been some activity that merits punishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we heard that Senator Coburn wanted to take on this issue, we welcomed that because we do believe we have a responsibility to regain the trust of our people. That is why under Senator Reid's leadership we passed the most far-reaching ethics reforms ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my friend is in the chair. She is part of the new class of Senators who pushed very hard for that legislation. Therefore, when Senator Coburn came forward, we believed we certainly wanted to do something. But what Senator Reid, because he is a distinguished attorney, taught me is, there is a speech and debate clause in the Constitution, and this investigation with a select committee, House Members and Senate Members investigating each other and staff, could fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the point, before my friend leaves the floor. The irony of all ironies is, if, in fact, the Coburn solution were to be adopted today and it did go forward, although we think it will bring the whole bill down, it wouldn't.  But let's say it is adopted. Nothing they do would really lead to anything until the end of their hearings. I call it kind of a circus atmosphere where colleagues would come, flashbulbs in everybody's face, and they take testimony.  Nothing of consequence would occur, I say to my friend,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>until the end when they decide if there was something the Justice Department needed to look into.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why have all that hoopla when you can get to the heart of the matter, which is saying to the Department of Justice: We want you--and this will require them. It doesn't say you "may," it says you "shall" look into this. If the bill did fall, here is the totally irony: The fix to Coconut Road would fall. In other words, in the technical corrections bill, we fix the problem. If this whole thing falls because of the Coburn amendment, then we go back to the real problem of somebody changing the  route of this particular road or building, freeway, whatever it was that was going to increase somebody's property. That would be the worst of all worlds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my leader for his help on this matter. He knows when I heard about this amendment, I said to him: Yes, we need to look into this, and he wanted to do it in the right way. He and his staff have been so helpful in getting us to this point where we have a very good alternative. I hope everybody votes for it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I hope everyone heard what the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee just said. If we are unable to pass this technical corrections bill, which we hope to do in an hour, an hour and a half, if we fail to do that, the fix that was put in the bill, the technical correction that was made to take care of the Coconut Road problem would not be taken care of. That would be a travesty and a circular road to nowhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I even hope my friend, Dr. Coburn, would withdraw his amendment. He perhaps will not do that, but I hope that everyone, Democrats and Republicans--this is not a partisan issue. It deals with housekeeping that we do. It is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, she also has another job that is extremely difficult and extremely important. She is chairman of the Ethics Committee. Having served on that Ethics Committee and having chaired that committee for a long time, I know it is a tough job. This gives me an opportunity publicly to say--and I think all Senators will extend this appreciation to her, Senator Cornyn and the other four Members who serve on that most  important committee, for the dedication and the hours they spend away from the cameras. These are in closed hearings talking about allegations made against individual Senators. They have done, and they continue to do, a remarkably good job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no one who is in a better position today to talk about what is going on in the Senate with matters of violations having been alleged than the Senator from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I think the amendment does is focus attention on the Justice Department, just where it should be. I hope everyone will go along with that amendment, Democrats and Republicans.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="HEALTH CARE">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I stand on the Senate floor and continue a very important discussion that I began with all of my Republican classmates in the Senate several weeks ago. It is about the need for dramatic, bold, health care reform in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We adopted this as a class project, if you will. Again, I thank my colleagues Senators THUNE, BURR, DEMINT, MARTINEZ, ISAKSON, and COBURN for their hard work on this important debate, on this important discussion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the idea is very simple: to put forward our conservative, free-market principles and what vision that leads to in terms of necessary, bold, transformative health care reform, and also to provide a clear contrast between that vision and the alternative, which is clearly in our mind a big government solution, a one-size-fits all solution that has the government role in health care grow and grow and private individual choice lessened and lessened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first week of this discussion on the Senate floor, I rose and laid out our broad principles and where we wanted this discussion to lead. Again, as I said that week, I believe there is great consensus in America, almost universal consensus that our health care delivery system is badly broken and that major reform needs to take place. But, of course, having said that, the hard part is figuring out what that change is and how it can work best for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said in those introductory comments, I believe the broad choices are clear. Our conservative, free-market vision is to empower the individual, to maximize choice, to help everyone get good private insurance that is accessible and affordable, to use taxpayer dollars where appropriate to help the truly poor afford that sort of good private insurance that stresses preventive care and other measures that will bring down health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that is a very different vision from one based on Government first and foremost, based on Government programs, one-size-fits-all, growing those programs and in the process lessening individual choice and responsibility and lessening the sanctity of the individual doctor-patient relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the second week of our discussion, our colleague JOHN THUNE came to the floor and elaborated on a very important component of this message, which is that we want to stress a choice of private health plans as a predominant factor in American health care versus Government programs, or the one-size-fits-all, pushing people more and more in that direction and increasing the dominance of Government in this very major sector of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following up on that, I come to the Senate floor this week to talk about a closely related principle and closely related theme, which is, again, opting for individual choice and incentives versus forced enrollment or forcing action upon citizens by the Government. Again, this is a crucial element of our vision for the dramatic, bold health care reform we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe firmly and we believe strongly that individuals are capable of choosing their own health insurance plan and that we must continue to focus on individuals and empowering individuals with choices and with incentives, not forcing individuals in a certain direction. So we are opposed to forcing people to enroll in certain plans rather than providing incentives for individuals to make rational choices that fit their own circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should be pushing reform that creates those incentives for individuals, for employers, for insurance companies, and for States to come up with innovative solutions. We shouldn't be forcing mandates down people's throats, forcing them to enroll in any particular big government or other program. The way we can most effectively maximize this choice and empower the individual is through the Tax Code, creating options for families and individuals through the Tax Code that help those families  buy insurance, that create those incentives that make sure it is accessible and affordable for everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as I suggest, Madam President, I have some pretty fundamental philosophical objections to mandating action on people. But in addition to that, I have some very practical concerns. If we look at other jurisdictions--States, even other countries--that force these mandates on people, we find they really don't work in the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few examples. Hawaii--obviously a State--has a mandate that all employers must provide their workers with health insurance. Well, they think that is a magic wand that just automatically solves the problem. But it doesn't. First of all, unfortunately, it creates a barrier in many instances to creating jobs, increasing employment, and growing business. So that is a problem. But even beyond that, it doesn't insure all workers. In fact, in Hawaii, 10 percent of workers--not unemployed people, not  nonworkers, but  10 percent of workers--- do not have health insurance. So there is the very practical issue of simply throwing out an edict, a mandate from the Government which doesn't accomplish the goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example is Canada. Canada requires everyone to be covered. Again, that creates significant challenges in actually making that happen and enforcing that rule. For instance, in the province of British Columbia alone, more than 40,000 people somehow slipped through the cracks or slipped through that mandate. It isn't a magic wand, and it doesn't get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we believe there is a better way, and that is to maximize choice, empower the individual, and create incentives. That will get a great number of people enrolled and provide more affordability and access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe, as a part of that, that existing Government programs can be improved and modernized and made more efficient. And that is important. But we are opposed to attempts which often come up in this body and the other body of Congress that try to significantly expand these programs well beyond the bounds of how they were originally set up, well beyond the core constituencies or income levels for which they were established. We believe that is going down the path of big government, nationalizing  health care, making government the dominant force by far, and we don't want to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also believe that encouraging competition in the marketplace is key to lowering health care costs. So we are opposed to price controls, profit ceilings, rigid expensive requirements, and mandates that usually end up doing exactly the opposite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe in recognizing that seniors have increasingly turned to Medicare Advantage Plans because they offer a better value and in many cases a higher quality of care than traditional fee-for-service Medicare. So we are opposed to efforts to dismantle these programs and again lessen choice, lessen individual responsibility and choice, and push folks in one certain direction--back to a one-size-fits-all traditional Medicare fee-for-service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also believe that taxes should be as low as possible and that the Tax Code should be changed to put money back into families' hands, which would allow them to purchase their own health insurance. We are opposed to increasing taxes and using that money to pay for a big government one-size-fits-all model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I look forward, as do all of my Republican Senate classmates--Senators THUNE and BURR, DEMINT, MARTINEZ, ISAKSON, and COBURN--to continuing this discussion, continuing this debate. As I said at the beginning, I believe virtually all of America agrees that the American health care delivery system is badly broken, that we are in desperate need of not just tinkering around the edges but bold, dramatic reform. So we want to come forward and lay out those conservative  and market-based principles that we believe are the right type of change, the type of reform Americans want, reform that empowers the individual, that respects that individual doctor-patient relationship, and that maximizes choice and creates incentives, and not the wrong choice that grows big government, that lessens choice, that increases mandates, that pushes individuals in a certain direction rather than allowing them to understand what best meets their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, Madam President, we will continue the discussion as another of my Republican Senate classmates takes to the floor to talk about another issue in this important debate, and I look forward to listening and participating in that discussion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="COBURN AND BOXER AMENDMENTS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to spend a few minutes just to make some observations during this short debate we are going to have before the amendments are voted on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to have a vote on the Boxer amendment and then on the Coburn amendment, both trying to get to the bottom of a problem. We have agreed to a 60-vote margin on both of those, but I wonder what happens to this issue if neither of those amendments gets 60 votes, and why are we having a 60-vote margin? Everybody agrees that this amendment about a postenrollment change to a bill needs to be solved. The mystery surrounding how it happened, where it happened, and why it happened needs to  be solved. But now we have before us a hurdle which, in all likelihood, will eliminate our ability to find out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is claimed, and understandably, that my amendment would look into a problem in the House. That assumption, however, is incorrect because nobody knows exactly where this enrollment change happened. Some may think they do, but we don't know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second of all, and probably more importantly, is the fact that a bill agreed to by both Houses of Congress was changed before it got to the President without our knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There also is the claim that if, in fact, we would have a bipartisan committee, with Members of both Houses looking into this, it is somehow precedent setting. It is not. In 1992, the House and Senate did combine--not on this specific issue--so there is a precedent there that no one can deny, that we looked at rules and processes and procedures, and we did that without any difficulty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other side of the aisle is the Boxer amendment, which says we are going to ask the Justice Department. We are not going to ask them, actually, we are going to tell them that they shall do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument has been made that the speech and debate clause is violated by my amendment. I don't think that is accurate, but I will take that as an argument. But for the Boxer amendment to pass, the separation of powers will be violated. These are not laws. These are rules of Congress. Yet we are going to now invite in the executive branch to handle what we refuse to handle? The cynicism in me says that maybe we don't want to know the answer to this question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We very simply could have had a majority vote on both of these, and the one that got the most votes would have won. We don't have the parliamentary power to force that to happen, and we do have the concurrent agreement of the chairwoman of the EPW Committee to have a vote, which I appreciate. I would not tell her that I do not appreciate that. I do appreciate the opportunity to have a vote. But the question still remains: What happens if we don't get 60 votes? Will something happen on this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I want us to do is restore the integrity of the enrollment process. If we fail to do that, if we fail to do that and if we invite the executive branch into our Houses, we have failed--we have failed to live up to our own responsibility in the Senate and in the House, and we have failed to protect what is truly a separation between us and the executive branch in how we have gone about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank the good nature and good humor of the chairman of the committee for the lively debate we had yesterday. But, someday, somebody will write about this issue, and I am not sure history is going to be very kind to us as we worry about partisan issues, who gets credit, who didn't, pointing fingers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, we have a problem that should be solved by a joint group of Members of this body. To say we can't do that denies the fact that we have integrity. We do have integrity. We do have honor. We do have commitment. And most of all, we want to build the confidence of the American people in Congress. I believe that will happen under my amendment. I am not sure it will happen if we don't pass it. As a matter of fact, I am certain that if we don't have one of these that gets accepted in conference,  we will not be able to claim that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard the statements of the chairwoman of the EPW Committee, and I believe her statements. So whatever happens here, it is my hope that she will encourage that to happen in conference. It won't be telling the House what to do; rather, it will be asking them to concur that we ought to look into this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington has a problem, and the problem is this: We are not believable  to the American public. More than 70 percent of the people in this country have no confidence in us, and we ought to be about repairing the institution and repairing that confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam President, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="COBURN AND BOXER AMENDMENTS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my colleague for bringing this issue to our attention. I think he knows that in the beginning there were some voices that said: Let's not deal with this. But we worked together, and we did come up eventually with a way to deal with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think some of our colleagues believe that where there is a constitutional issue and a precedent-setting issue here involving such a delicate matter, such a matter that could lead to a criminal investigation and punishment, we ought to have some type of consensus on it. But I share his concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute before we go to the regular order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="COBURN AND BOXER AMENDMENTS">
    <paragraph>I think if neither amendment gets 60 votes--and I certainly hope the Boxer amendment does, and I expect it would, but I don't know, it might not--I am already working on an alternative I would talk to my friend about right now, which is for us to communicate in writing very strongly to the Justice Department and tell them how strongly we feel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to make the point that my friend is right. Someday, somebody will write about this. People are already writing about it because of the work we are doing on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator and I have been quite forceful in the way we feel about this. People are writing about it. My hope is that what we do is not create a new kind of select committee. My friend said it has been done before, and he may be right. But why a committee when we can get right to the heart of the matter, which is: Was there a crime? If so, let's get to the bottom of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say, and I say this as chair of the Ethics Committee of the Senate, nothing is more important to me than having a fair Ethics Committee that works hard and is objective. Any Member of the Senate can make a complaint any day of the week and it automatically is looked at. I want to reiterate that. If people have an issue, please, let us know. That is why we are there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who care a lot about this matter, we do need, if nobody gets 60--I hope we will, but if nobody does, this issue does not go away as far as I am concerned. It cannot go away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is very important, the way we deal with this, to understand that if we do something that the House has constitutional objections to and it brings down the technical corrections bill, the irony of ironies is the Coconut Road project doesn't get fixed, it goes back to the crooked way it was handled. We don't want that. We want to fix the Coconut Road problem and we want to have an investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor to get to the regular order at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Under the regular order, there will be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote on amendment No. 4539, offered by the Senator from California, as modified.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, we have a very simple amendment. Sometimes in simplicity is strength. Sometimes in simplicity is power. Sometimes in simplicity you get to the place you want to get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not like a lot of words. I believe a few words will say it. Look at what we say here:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consistent with applicable standards and procedures--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>which means everybody's rights are protected--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the Department of Justice shall review allegations of impropriety regarding item 462 in section 1934(c) of Public Law 109-59--&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the Coconut Road project--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>to ascertain if a violation of Federal criminal law has occurred. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we know enough to warrant this kind of amendment. I think we know enough to be concerned. I think we know enough to say to the Justice Department: Please pay attention to this. Do your work. Make a determination and get on with it because this is very serious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time in opposition?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I will repeat the three points I think are important. No. 1 is we do not know enough. The next amendment relates to the Justice Department if we do know enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 2 is I am very hesitant to set a precedent that invites the Justice Department to come into the Senate and House to investigate us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 3, and finally, the Justice Department does not have to do it even if we say they shall. They do not have to do it. There is no force of law that we can make the Justice Department come and investigate us. If we did, our forefathers would roll over in their graves. That is what the separation of powers is all about. When we go directly to the Justice Department, we shirk our responsibility to control our own house and bring our own Members under it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to not support this new precedent setting seeking of the Justice Department, in violation of the separation of powers, to come into the Senate and the House to do an investigation before we have done our own investigation to find out the jot and tittles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we have voted an invitation to the Justice Department to investigate a rules violation in either the House or the Senate. We have set an amazing precedent.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Colleagues, this is very important. I wish to commend my colleague for bringing this whole issue to the floor of the Senate. But I think we have done something important. We have taken his concerns to heart, and with a very big vote, we have stated that the Justice Department is now required to open an investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Senator does is set up an elaborate commission of Senators, of House Members; it is political on its face. It will only put off the day until an investigation is done by Justice. Because after having this elaborate commission, Senators investigating House Members, House Members investigating Senators, it is unconstitutional on its face on the speech and debate clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That will bring down this entire bill. Here is the irony of ironies. If we bring this bill down, the fix of Coconut Road will fall. We fix the Coconut Road problem in this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak to an amendment to the pending legislation by myself and Senator Casey, which would authorize an addition of lane miles in Pennsylvania to the Appalachian Development Highway System so that a vital highway project can be constructed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Central Susquehanna Valley Thruway project is a proposed 13-mile, four-lane limited access highway extending from the Selinsgrove Bypass of U.S. Routes 11/15 to PA Route 147 in Northumberland. Because the project involves construction of a bridge across the Susquehanna River, the estimated cost to construct it is $370 million. The current conditions are a major impediment to north-south travel in Central Pennsylvania and this project is widely supported by State and local elected officials.  In addition to the traffic problems it will address, the project is a major economic development initiative in the predominately rural region between Williamsport and Harrisburg. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, PENNDOT, has thus far not been able to identify the funds necessary</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ADHS encompasses 2,600 miles across the Appalachian States and is administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The intention of this highway system is to improve the connectivity of economically depressed Appalachian regions with metropolitan areas. Approximately 500 miles of the ADHS have yet to be completed, including 178 miles which need to be completed within Pennsylvania. Although the affected counties of Northumberland, Snyder, and Union are within the Appalachian region, this  12-mile route in question is not a part of the existing ADHS system and therefore does not qualify for ADHS funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would authorize Federal ADHS assistance for the 13-mile thruway project. For purposes of connectivity, it would also authorize a larger 52-mile segment from I-180 near Williamsport to the intersection of U.S. 11/15 and U.S. 22 near Duncannon as part of the ADHS. This will connect the 13-mile system to the rest of Pennsylvania's existing ADHS system, but the only segment of this 52-mile addition that would be eligible for funding under the amendment is the 13-mile thruway project.  Further the amendment provides that this addition will not affect Pennsylvania's Federal ADHS apportionment. It is important to note that the amendment does not provide more funding to Pennsylvania, it simply gives PENNDOT the ability to use existing ADHS apportionment funding for this high-priority project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I also wish to speak to an amendment to the pending legislation by myself and Senator Casey, regarding the use of "toll credits" by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, PENNDOT, with respect to construction of the U.S. Route 219 highway improvement project in Somerset County, PA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Somerset County Commissioners have identified the U.S. Route 219 improvement project as essential to improving north-south transportation mobility and safety in Somerset County. The project involves construction of a four-lane, limited access highway connecting the towns of Somerset and Meyersdale, PA. A 1999 study conducted by PENNDOT noted that this section of U.S. Route 219 has a number of deficiencies that cause traffic congestion and high accident rates. The project also promises economic  benefits by linking motorists with a new business park. PENNDOT received approval to conduct environmental and engineering studies in 1999 and planned on using "toll credits" to match $45 million in Federal funds allocated to the project through the Appalachian Development Highway System, ADHS, program. However, the necessary land was not acquired until 2006, and in the meantime, the 2005 SAFETEA-LU bill prohibited the use of toll credits as a non-Federal match requirement to ADHS funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Toll credits are a "soft-match" that allow States to substitute previous, toll-financed transportation spending as a credit toward the match requirement. In doing so, it effectively increases the Federal share to 100 percent, thereby reducing the pot of available Federal funds. With the limited availability of Federal resources, I can understand why Congress would have an interest in ensuring that States contribute actual dollars toward highway construction projects rather than credits. That  is why this amendment does not eliminate the prohibition on the use of toll credits to match ADHS dollars. This is something that we can debate as we consider the next highway and transit authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment provides for a narrow exception to that prohibition. It would allow PENNDOT, in the case of U.S. Route 219 only, to use toll credits so that this important transportation and economic development project can move forward. I believe this exception to the toll credit prohibition is warranted at this time because PENNDOT was planning on using them when it entered the environmental and engineering phase of this project. Without the ability to use credits, I am advised that PENNDOT  has no matching funds available to finance this project.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate is now debating the SAFETEA-LU technical corrections bill. It is regrettable that we had to file cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill in order to make progress on this legislation. This is a technical corrections bill. It fixes mistakes made in the heat of passage of SAFETEA-LU, a bill that was 835 pages long. These types of technical corrections bills are not at all uncommon, and almost always pass with little, if any debate, much less disagreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the relevant committees the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the transit title of the bill, the EPW Committee, with highway jurisdiction, and the Commerce Committee, which oversees highway safety--have worked together in a bipartisan fashion to produce a corrections bill with broad support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague and ranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, for his work in producing this title, which passed the Banking Committee unanimously in May of last year. I also want to commend EPW Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe, as well as Commerce Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens, for their hard work on developing this highly technical bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, despite these efforts, we have been blocked from moving forward by a small handful of our colleagues. I want to thank the majority leader for making time in the Senate's schedule to debate this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this is only a corrections bill, it will have a real impact for our local communities, which are struggling to keep up with the demands of crumbling infrastructure. There are funds that were authorized in SAFETEA-LU to help meet these demands, but for technical reasons, they have not been distributed. This bill will unlock those funds so that they can be used for the purpose for which they were intended, which is to shore up our transit systems, our roads and bridges--all of the vital  components of  the transportation network that we rely on every day for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funds that would be unlocked by passage of this bill will allow for critical maintenance and capital improvement projects to go forward on our roadways; they will allow for dangerous overpasses to be replaced; they will allow for transit systems to more efficiently meet the needs of their riders; and they will allow for a greater degree of safety on our roads and rails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is important to understand, this bill does not cost a single penny. It allows funds that have already been authorized to be distributed as intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Banking Committee reported the transit title of this bill last May. We worked closely with our colleagues here in the Senate as well as in the House to develop a bipartisan, consensus package. I want to again thank my ranking member, Senator Shelby, for his efforts on this bill; he has worked hard to try to get this done since the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Banking Committee's title of this bill addresses the drafting errors contained in the transit title of SAFETEA-LU and makes necessary changes to various project authorizations so that funds can be released. In addition, I just want to note that this bill recognizes the hard work and leadership of our former colleague, and past chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes, by naming the Transit in Parks program, which he authored, after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is more important than ever that we invest in our Nation's transit systems. Safe, reliable, and efficient public transportation is essential if we are to tackle the growing problems of traffic congestion, rising gas prices, and global climate change. Transit systems provide significant benefits both to transit riders and to others in the community, including employers, property owners, and automobile drivers. For example, when people ride transit, the amount of time that transit riders and  automobile drivers alike spend in traffic goes down; in fact, the Texas Transportation Institute has estimated that transit saves Americans over $18 billion a year by reducing the time they would otherwise waste sitting on clogged roadways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, in this era of high gasoline prices, public transportation provides an additional benefit: according to economists Robert Shapiro and Kevin Hassett, public transportation saves more than 855 million gallons of gasoline a year, helping to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and providing us with a cleaner, healthier environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transit ridership is at the highest level in 40 years, and strong support for transit is essential in light of this increasing demand. In fact, I strongly believe that if we are to keep up with the demands of our growing economy, we must renew our commitment to our Nation's infrastructure, not just in transportation, but in water systems, housing, and other areas. Senator Hagel and I have put forward a proposal to create a National Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage private investment  through tax-credit bonds to fund large-scale, regionally or nationally significant infrastructure projects. I held a hearing on this proposal last month and I intend to hold another in the coming weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an enormous challenge before us in meeting the infrastructure needs of our nation. The National Infrastructure Bank is not intended to be the only tool in our toolbox; neither is the technical corrections bill we are discussing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But passage of the bill now before the Senate would be an essential step forward in meeting that challenge. It would put an end to the technicalities that are holding up vital funding for road and transit improvements. There is no excuse for any further delay in getting these funds to the communities which need them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take just a moment to address the Administration's Statement of Administration Policy opposing one of the provisions in the transit title of this bill, related to the transit New Starts program. This program, which supports the development and construction of new transit systems, is widely recognized for its focus on performance measures and accountability. Each applicant for New Starts funds enters a rigorous review process based on statutory rating criteria, including factors such as  mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and cost effectiveness. In order to more fully capture the impact that a major transit project has on communities, Congress in SAFETEA-LU added economic development and land use effects to the statutory list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Federal Transit Administration is not applying the statutory rating criteria as Congress intended. Instead, the FTA has assigned inordinate weight to a few statutory factors, while giving others, such as economic development and environmental benefits, only minimal weight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in the technical corrections bill reiterates Congress's intent in SAFETEA-LU that each of the factors must be given comparable weight when evaluating New Starts grant applications. This language passed the House of Representatives last summer as part of their technical corrections package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues, I could not disagree more with the position the administration is taking on this point. The language in the transit title has broad bipartisan support, both from the Banking Committee and from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. If the Administration does not agree with the criteria included in SAFETEA-LU for the evaluation of New Starts projects, I would be happy to consider their views in the context of the next reauthorization. I intend to begin that  process later this year and I expect to proceed in an open and bipartisan way. In the meantime, the administration's responsibility is to implement the law, and unfortunately they have failed to do so in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, although it is technical, this is an important bill. It has broad bipartisan support on both sides of the Capitol and would allow urgently needed funds to be distributed to the States and local communities trying to address their transportation needs. I commend it to my colleagues and ask for their support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am proud to support <bill type="h" number="1195">H.R. 1195</bill>, a bill to amend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act, and the benefits that it will provide to West Virginia and the rest of the country. However, I must oppose the two amendments offered by Senators BOXER and COBURN. Both amendments have the good intention of ensuring open and honest government, but I must oppose them because of my concerns about their implications, particularly as they  may impinge on the powers of the legislative branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the Senators for their attempts to eliminate any waste, fraud, and abuse that have plagued the Congress in previous years. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have instituted on-line access to spending bills, so that the public may see where their tax money is being spent. But both of these amendments may inappropriately expose Congress to scrutiny by the executive branch by way of the Department of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress is fully capable of proceeding with its own internal investigations. Both Houses have bipartisan Ethics Committees that may undertake these investigations. If criminal activities are discovered in the course of a congressional inquiry, such crimes should then be investigated by the appropriate Federal authorities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we just heard objection, but we didn't get objection, finally, to the technical corrections bill. We are happy about that. You and I serve together on the Environment and Public Works Committee. We know our work is important because we know that no country can be great if it doesn't have an infrastructure that is up to par. The occupant of the chair knows more than most what it means when a bridge collapses. We know what that means. So what we are doing here is a  matter of life and death, quite often.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This technical corrections bill will make it possible to continue work on over 500 projects that were stymied for various reasons. It is going to put a billion dollars into our economy, and it will provide tens of thousands of jobs. Senator Inhofe and I are very grateful that--even though this was not an easy week and this bill took so many twists and turns and we had to work our way through many issues--we have arrived at the point where it passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say how much I enjoyed working with my staff and the staff of Senator Inhofe. I am going to read the names of those who deserve to be recognized and thanked. From my staff are Bettina Porier, Kathy Dedrick, Tyler Rushforth, Jeff Rosato, Erik Olsen, Paul Ordal, and the rest of my staff. We do work as a team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Inhofe's staff, and I am sure there are more to be thanked, but the ones I worked with closely are, of course, Andy Wheeler, chief over there, Ruth Van Mark, James O'Keeffe, and Alex Herrgott. We are so grateful to you for being close to us, staying close to us, letting us know when there were problems. We appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the majority leader, Senator Reid, how much I appreciated his interest in this bill. He really helped us. Bob Herbert, of his staff, Ron Wynch, and Mike Castellano--we had technical issues and legal issues and they were there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I am leaving anyone out, please know it is not my intention. So many others helped us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to say, in closing, to floor staff, all of you here, thank you for your patience. You have to answer questions. The pages have to be available to us. You all let us know what is going on and whether we are doing it right or wrong. Of course, in particular, I thank Lula, Tim, and Dave. Without the three of you, we could not have gotten this done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, sometimes when you get to this point, it is a little like making sausage--that is what they say about how a bill becomes a law; it is not a pretty thing. But we got it done. The most important thing is all of the people who helped us from the outside groups--I thank them--such as the construction industry, the construction workers, the transit district operators, the sand and gravel people. You know who you are. You made the point that we should not bog this bill down, that we should get  it going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted we had a victory here with the Water Resources Development Act. We are pleased. Up and coming, we are going to have a markup in a couple of weeks, and then we will get to global warming. I don't know how that will end, but I know it is going to be very exciting.
