  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the service that Arthur (Art) J. Schut has provided to so many in my home State of Iowa. Art is an Iowan that has dedicated over 30 years of himself to the disenfranchised of our communities. He has worked tirelessly on a local, State, and national level to provide care, counseling, and education for families, the public, and lawmakers to minimize the negative stigma and to secure funding and resources for those with addiction and mental  health issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art began his distinguished career nearly 40 years ago as a program director for the Des Moines Metropolitan YMCA working with youth gangs. Since that time, Art has served in a variety of roles working on behalf of those who suffer from the scourge of addiction and other mental illness. Art has served as a member of the University of Iowa faculty and as a clinical and treatment director. During this period in Art's life, he supervised several drug treatment and education programs throughout southeast  Iowa, and he provided vital education for future substance abuse professionals through his position with the University of Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art will soon be leaving the position that he has dutifully served in for 25 years as President and CEO of the Mid-Eastern Council on Chemical Abuse, MECCA. Throughout his service as the President of MECCA, Art has overseen the administration of operations and programs in three regions throughout  Iowa. These operations include outpatient offices in 16 counties, a prevention unit, employee assistance program for regional businesses and industries, a residential  treatment program, and a detoxification unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Art will soon be leaving the great State of Iowa, but he will be continuing the good fight against addiction and abuse. Barbara and I want to extend our gratitude for all the years of service and for the positive impact on all the lives Art has had throughout his remarkable career. We wish Art all the best in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
