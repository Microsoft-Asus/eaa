    <paragraph>Mr. President, on February 16, the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost a favorite son. Marian "Gene" Snyder was born on January 26, 1928 in Louisville, KY, to a working-class family. He would often say he was "a poor boy from the other side of the tracks in a cold-water flat." His upbringing during the Great Depression and the work ethic taught to him by his mother and father would serve Gene well in future years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene worked his way through college and law school and earned a law degree from the University of Louisville at the ripe young age of 26. He was appointed to his first political post as Jeffersontown city attorney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, Louisville Republican leaders saw they had a great young candidate and backed him for his first race for Congress. Gene won that race and represented the people of Kentucky's third congressional district for the next 2 years. Gene unfortunately lost reelection in 1964, but as he did all of his life, he bounced back and in 1966 he won the fourth congressional seat. He would serve and hold that seat with distinction for the next 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene was instrumental in bringing a number of important infrastructure projects back to Kentucky while serving on the Public Works Committee. One of his greatest achievements is a freeway that bears his name in Louisville, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene Snyder worked hard to make sure Kentucky got its fair share from the Federal Government. But I think the most important thing he did was to validate conservatism in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Back in the early 1960s, you couldn't count on one hand the number of Republicans in Kentucky. Gene Snyder was the first brick in the foundation of what the Republican Party is today in Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene had something lacking in today's world of weekly polls and political consultants. Gene had conservative principles and never wavered from those principles. Gene Snyder actually stood for something. That is why I consider Gene Snyder one of my political mentors. I would not be standing here in the well of this great Senate if it were not for Gene Snyder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Mary and I extend our thoughts and prayers to Pat, Gene's beloved wife, and the entire Snyder family. Gene was a true patriot and a great American who loved the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the citizens he represented.</paragraph>
