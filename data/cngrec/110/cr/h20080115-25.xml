    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, murder in the name of religion has struck again. This time it happened in Dallas, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On New Year's Day law enforcement officials found the bullet-riddled bodies of two teenage sisters, 17-year-old Sarah Said and 18-year-old Amina Said. They were found in the back seat of their father's taxicab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now their father, Yaser Said, a Muslim and an Egyptian-born immigrant, is on the run. Authorities believe he murdered the girls after he found out they had American boyfriends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Family members say the murder was motivated by a Muslim tradition known as "honor killing." According to this tradition, religious extremists justify homicide in the name of religion in order to correct the "shame" that a family member has brought on the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, in the United States it is absolutely never acceptable, let alone honorable, to murder your own kids. This criminal needs to be tried and sent to prison. We live in a Nation that values life and liberty. And no father has a right to kill his daughters and try to claim the defense, "My religion made me do it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
