  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour. Once that is closed, we will go back to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. There are no votes scheduled, although there are seven amendments pending. Perhaps we can dispose of some of those before lunch. We will certainly have some votes during the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another issue which I have mentioned on many occasions is the 9/11 Commission recommendations conference report. That report was to be filed late last night. It is not available. It should be momentarily. We will make sure Senators have the opportunity to look at that. It is a large document.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about this week. I know there is a trip scheduled this weekend. I contacted Senator Boxer last night and indicated to her I wasn't quite certain it would be able to take place. She was understanding and said I would have to do what I have to do, although she was disappointed. Maybe the trip can still go. It is a bipartisan trip to Greenland, led by Senators Boxer and Isakson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have a lot to do this week, but it could take a lot of time. We have 2 days. It is Thursday. We need to finish Homeland Security appropriations. I had a conversation last night with Senator Cornyn. We were waiting to get his language yesterday when we were trying to work something out for funding for the border. He had it written out in longhand. Anyway, we don't have it yet, but I am sure we will get that soon. Maybe we can complete that with a unanimous consent. Senator Voinovich  indicated he wished to speak on it for a while but not long. So we want to accommodate him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we want to finish the bill we are on, either today or tomorrow. The other thing we need to do is complete the conference report. I hope we don't have to file cloture on the Homeland Security appropriations bill, which I have said many times I don't want to do. It is an open process, where people can file amendments, and they have done that. We hope we don't have to file cloture also on the conference report. What I wish to do--and I indicated this on a number of occasions--is to be able to  start SCHIP on Monday. It appears that is pretty well set, what would happen when we get to that bill. It is a bipartisan bill that would be brought to the floor. There are a number of Senators who have worked on a substitute--Senator Kyl, among others. That substitute would certainly be the main topic of the debate. I am confident there will be some other amendments offered, but that is the main issue as to whether the substitute would pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So children's health, we need to do that next week. I hope we can start it on Monday. Then the only other thing we need to do is to complete ethics and lobbying reform. As I have indicated, I wish to start another appropriations bill, but that would not take a vote during this session, though we would move to it before we leave. We would only do WRDA, the conference report  on WRDA. It is my understanding the conference is basically completed, but we  would only move to that if Senators Boxer and Inhofe indicated they wanted us to do that. I understand they do. It has wide-ranging bipartisan support. But that wasn't in my original package and that will not hold us up. The only thing that will hold us up is the bill we are on</paragraph>
