    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. During this month, numerous national service organizations, professional medical associations, and government and local agencies are working to promote breast cancer awareness, share information and provide access to screening services to women nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you may know, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women--around 180,000 women in the United States will be found to have invasive breast cancer in 2007. Furthermore, about 40,500 women will die from the disease this year. And right now there are slightly over 2 million women living in the United States who have been treated for breast cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in my home State, of New Jersey, we have one of the highest incidence rates of breast cancer in the Nation, averaging approximately 8,000 new cases per year. New Jersey also has one of the highest morbidity rates associated with breast cancer--approximately 1,500 deaths per year. These statistics are painful. Mothers and sisters and daughters are struggling to survive this disease across the country--a disease that is treatable through proper education, early diagnosis, and aggressive  therapy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Routine mammography screening is an especially effective means of detecting breast cancer at the earliest stages. That is why during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I urge women nationally to maintain a regular mammography schedule. When breast cancer is diagnosed at early stages, the chance of survival greatly increases. Aside from mammographies, the American Cancer Society recommends that women obtain annual clinical breast exams, perform monthly breast self exams, and obtain a risk assessment  from a physician to maintain their own breast health, and to catch breast cancer at the earliest stage possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although it may seem like breast cancer solely plagues women, there are documented cases, although rare, of male breast cancer. In fact, it is estimated that in 2007 some 2,030 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among men in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there is hope among these devastating statistics; with knowledge and early screening, many cases can be caught early, increasing patients' chances of survival tremendously. We need to increase our outreach to men and women so we can combat this devastating disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to remember that Breast Cancer Awareness Month cannot just be a 31-day event--we must take action every day of the year if we have a hope of increasing treatment and saving lives.</paragraph>
