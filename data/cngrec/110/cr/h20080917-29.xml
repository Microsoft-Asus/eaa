    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6229">H.R. 6229</bill>, which names the post office located at 2523 Seventh Avenue East in North St. Paul, Minnesota, after the late William "Bill" Sandberg, the longtime mayor of North St. Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for  bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation for their support as original cosponsors of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Naming a post office in honor of Bill Sandberg is a fitting tribute to a dedicated public servant, a successful businessman and a wonderful human being. Bill was loved by the residents of North St. Paul. He was also my dear friend and political mentor. A committed Republican, Mayor Sandberg took me under his wing and instilled in me the lesson that community always comes before politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William Sandberg was born in the Selby-Grand Avenue neighborhood of St. Paul in 1932. His family later moved to North St. Paul where he lived the remainder of his life. Bill graduated from North St. Paul High School and the University of Minnesota. After serving our country with honor in the U.S. Army, he returned home to the family business, Sandberg Funeral Home, with his brother Paul. As a funeral director he was respected by his peers. He was a true business leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1978, the voters in North St. Paul elected Bill Sandberg to serve as mayor. With a fatherly hand he guided the city for 30 years, sharing his warmth, his optimism and his generous spirit with everyone he encountered. A person of great faith, Bill always sought to bring people together in constructive ways to solve the problems of our community. As a mayor, Bill Sandberg's legacy is one of exemplary public service, distinguished by common sense, fairness and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was honored to serve under his leadership on the North St. Paul City Council and work closely with him in the following years. I learned from Bill's leadership that the political maxim, "all politics are local" was true. It's true whether you serve on a city council or in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Bill Sandberg passed away on April 20, 2008. He left behind colleagues, city staff and constituents who loved him. He left behind a loving family who will miss him, his daughter, Karen; son-in-law, Jack; and his grandchildren, Carolyn and William. Bill's wife, Delores, whom he loved profoundly, preceded him in death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Sandberg loved the people he served. Upon learning about his leukemia diagnosis, he wrote a letter to the residents of North St. Paul. His letter speaks volumes about the great leader he was. In this letter, Bill acknowledged his illness. He expressed his pride for the community of North St. Paul and a pride that came directly from neighbors coming together to meet the city's challenges. Bill also wrote of his sincere gratitude for having the opportunity to serve the people of his city  for so many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to conclude with Bill's words to the people of North St. Paul:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I would like to thank everyone again for making this town a very special place to live and raise families. I do not know what the future holds, but I do know Who holds the future."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I greatly appreciate the support of my colleagues for this legislation. At the time of his death, Mayor Sandberg was the longest serving mayor in Minnesota history. His spirit and service are irreplaceable. For all who knew and worked with him, the blessing of his friendship was a treasure for us all. Recognizing Mayor Sandberg's service and leadership by naming this post office in his honor is a fitting tribute to a man who gave so much to a community he loved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CITIZEN, As many of you know, I was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia. And as many of you who have had similar, life-altering diagnoses also know, such an evaluation makes one stop and reflect on what is really important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since this is my 30th year serving as your mayor, it is undeniable that you residents and this town have been significant in my life. I have written to you many times about how I appreciate the friendliness of residents and cooperation among residents, businesses, the school district and the city. As I think back, there have been many changes, none of which would have been successful without this cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember when McKnight Fields were under renovation in the early '90s? Local service clubs provided funding for a majority of the work, businesses donated materials, city crews provided the labor. And after the work was done, the city and school district entered a cooperative agreement for allowing the schools to use the fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admit we residents haven't always agreed on everything. For example, there were varying opinions on where the new high school should be located. But as soon as the school opened (in the fall of 1997), we put our differences behind us and reunited as a community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to take credit for the many changes that have taken place through the years, but I'm quickly reminded that my pride must be directed to you. It was you citizens who recognized the safety issues in our police and fire departments plus crowded administrative conditions that resulted in construction of our new city hall. It was you citizens who supported construction of our community center. It was you who, through the years, have backed the expansion and construction of public works facilities  and park improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it was the volunteer efforts of you citizens that have certainly contributed to our town being a beautiful place to live. Back in the early '90s we started the Take Pride program, recognizing residents for improvements they were making in their yards and gardens. And what about all the volunteers who have helped through the years with North St. Paul Green? I remember getting a letter from a Maplewood resident who commended the city for its beautification efforts. She said she'd go out of  her way to drive through our downtown just to see the flowers! The efforts of our North St. Paul Green volunteers were also recognized by the Midwest Living Magazine, which named North St. Paul one of 20 Midwestern cities with "hometown pride."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I close this letter, I'd like to thank everyone, again, for making this town a very special place to live and raise families. I do not know what the future holds, but I do know Who holds the future!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless you all,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Sandberg,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6229">H.R. 6229</bill>, to rename the post office in North St. Paul, Minnesota, in honor of former Mayor William "Bill" Sandberg. Mayor Sandberg died April 20 at the age of 76 after serving for more than 30 years as mayor of his beloved hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He graduated in 1950 from North St. Paul High School where he played football and hockey and from the University of Minnesota in 1954 with a degree in mortuary science. After serving his country in the Army, Mayor Sandberg returned to North St. Paul and became a director at his family's business, the Sandberg Funeral Home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He became mayor in 1978 and began a career known for character, personality, fairness and decorum. Described by fellow members of the City Council as a "problem solver who could get people to think in different ways," he made a point of never coming into a meeting with his mind made up. He also made a point of putting people at ease when they came to testify before the council and for keeping debates focused on the issues at hand, not personalities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This openness, this credibility, this unflinching optimism brought citizens together even when his ideas didn't enjoy universal support. Among his greatest legacies will be his insistence that Highway 36 run through the center of North St. Paul. Some feared the increased traffic would bring nothing but pollution and gridlock. But Mayor Sandberg insisted that thousands of commuters would visit the city's downtown area who otherwise never would know it existed. This championing of all things North  St. Paul permeated everything the mayor did. He considered attendance at local high school hockey games and Chamber of Commerce meetings as important as attending council meetings. He encouraged others to participate in council activities and worked tirelessly to connect citizens to their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city already has begun to honor its beloved former mayor by renaming a bridge in his honor. Let us join in this celebration of an exemplary public servant, support this resolution and rename the local post office in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration and support <bill type="h" number="6229">H.R. 6229</bill>, which names a postal facility in North St. Paul, Minnesota, after Mayor William "Bill" Sandberg. <bill type="h" number="6229">H.R. 6229</bill> was introduced by Representative BETTY MCCOLLUM on June 10, 2008, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008, by voice vote. The measure has been cosponsored by the entire Minnesota House delegation and pays tribute to one of the  State's most well known public officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William "Bill" Sandberg was a longtime resident of North St. Paul, Minnesota, who served his beloved city as  mayor for 30 years until his death on April 20, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>First elected in 1978, Mayor Sandberg was reelected seven times. Known for his good sense of humor, Mayor Sandberg once joked that the reason he kept getting reelected was simply because no one else wanted the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mayor, Mr. Sandberg earned a reputation for his ability to bring people together by his warm, personable style. During the controversial meeting of the North St. Paul City Council, Mayor Sandberg once remarked that "we were friends before the meeting, and while we may not agree on this, we will be friends when we walk out." He exhibited this same unique ability in bringing people together when he successfully solved divisive issues, such as the reconstruction of Highway 36.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before assuming the position of mayor, Bill Sandberg served in the United States Army during the 1950s. He then went on to a successful business career, joining his parents' funeral home business in St. Paul and White Bear Lake, Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, given Mayor Sandberg's commitment to his community, his State and to our country, I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from the Indiana (Mr. Pence).</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6229">H.R. 6229</bill>, honoring the life and the work and memory of Mayor William "Bill" Sandberg of St. Paul, Minnesota. I believe, given the tenure of his career and the durability of his reputation, we can assume in both parties that Mayor Sandberg was a man at the local level that attended himself to what people were really dealing with and he provided leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is about just that focus that I also wanted to rise, Mr. Speaker, today. Because I rise this afternoon, I think with millions of Americans, simply to express my frustration, that after only one day of debate, late in the night last night, this Congress again failed to pass a bipartisan bill that would set us on a course for energy independence in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must tell you that it was equally frustrating today to awaken and see headlines around the country that say "Congress eases restrictions on drilling." But I don't want to be critical of my friends in the Fourth Estate. This bill was revealed to the world 24 hours before it was voted. It was written in the back rooms here in the Capitol, not considered by committees, but brought to the floor abruptly the night before last and just as abruptly voted without amendment or without serious consideration  in the Congress. So I won't fault members of the media, who didn't understand that the drill-nothing Democrat Congress actually only moved to a position that was the drill-almost-nothing Democrat Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this legislation, despite the headlines, is a story worth telling. For the past 20 months, until last week, the Democrat majority in Congress made one thing more clear than anything else; there would never be a vote on more domestic drilling in America. Speaker  Nancy Pelosi repeated her personal and historic opposition to drilling and said that she would never permit a vote. And they adjourned on August 1, turned off the cameras and turned off the lights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Republicans refused to leave. We held this floor during the entirety of the August recess, and during that time the Democrat majority changed their position. In a very real sense, millions of Americans contacted their Members of Congress and said we want more access to American oil. We want Congress to come together and compromise on conservation, fuel efficiency, solar, wind, nuclear, an all-of-the-above strategy. But we want a bill that allows us to drill into our domestic resources. And,  to their credit, the Democratic majority relented in their historic opposition to drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bill that came to the floor abruptly and was just as abruptly passed last night failed in many counts. Not only did it bring with it an enormous tax increase, not only did it bring with it no opportunity for new refineries, no opportunity for nuclear energy development and other powerful alternatives, but also this bill truly brought with it very little, if any, opportunity to drill into our own domestic reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill seems to allow drilling, but not within 50 miles of shore. Most experts say that 88 percent of our domestic reserves are within 50 miles of the shoreline of the east coast and the west coast and the eastern Gulf. Beyond that, the Democrat bill that passed last night would allow drilling, but only if States vote by referendum or in their legislature to permit the drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That sounds reasonable enough. But what is not reasonable is the Democratic bill, unlike current law for Gulf States that allow drilling, the Democratic bill offered States no revenue whatsoever. So people in South Carolina, people in California, would presumably have to decide for themselves or their elected representatives decide to allow drilling off of their shore if it meant nothing financially to their State coffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also there was a failure to provide any streamlined judicial review or litigation reform, leaving any drilling that would be allowed beyond the 50 mile limit to be tied up immediately in court, as hundreds and hundreds of leases are tied up today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is why I say, and I attempt to be intellectually honest about this, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority did move on their energy policy about drilling. They went from a drill-nothing Democrat Congress to a drill-almost-nothing Democratic Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last night, most sadly, they passed on an opportunity that some 40 Democrats had been working tirelessly to develop, legislation coauthored by Congressman Abercrombie and Congressman Peterson that is a truly bipartisan solution. I was a cosponsor of the bill myself. Dozens upon dozens of Republicans joined us in the bill, as well as I believe 40 Democrat Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it came time for the Republicans to offer their alternative, quite frankly, we could have played some sort of a game, but we think that the American people are struggling under the weight of record gasoline prices. Families are hurting, seniors are hurting, and this was not time for political posturing or games. So we brought the bipartisan bill to the floor as our alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strangely, unless I can be corrected, only 13 of the Democrats out of the some 40 who cosponsored the bill voted for it. It was a true bipartisan bill that had been fashioned through tough bipartisan negotiation over months of time, and it was rejected by many of the same Democrats who had worked to build the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We missed an opportunity last night, Mr. Speaker, to truly do something for the American people, to do something, as Daniel Webster says on words on these walls, to do something worthy to be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise today to pay sincere tribute to Mayor William "Bill" Sandberg. I am confident that this tribute on this Post Office is altogether fitting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also rise to just simply express my frustration that, at a time when we hear about one bailout after another, this Democrat majority passed an energy bill last night that Democrat Senator MARY LANDRIEU even said was "dead on arrival in the Senate." We accomplished nothing to set this Nation on a course of energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So our message is very simple: We are not going away. We are going to fight on this floor in every moment that we have left, in the waning days of this Congress and in the weeks preceding our national election, to demand that this Congress roll our sleeves up and seek that bipartisan consensus that does exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say from my heart, I truly believe that there is a bipartisan majority in this Congress that would say yes to conservation, yes to fuel efficiency, yes to solar, wind and nuclear, and would say yes to a substantial increase in domestic drilling that was real and significant and would lessen our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Republicans are going to stay in this fight. Bailouts for corporate America, but no relief for our citizens struggling under the record weight of gasoline prices is not acceptable to Republicans in this Congress. We will stay on this floor. We will continue in this fight. We are not going away until the American people have a bipartisan strategy that sets us on a short-term course to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and on a long-term course for energy independence in the 21st century.</paragraph>
