    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important contributions that teachers make to our Nation. Next week is National Teacher Appreciation Week. The National PTA created Teacher Appreciation Week in 1984 to show gratitude to the many teachers in the United States. It is a chance for us to thank those individuals who have contributed greatly to society in ways that cannot be measured. It is a chance for us to recognize the selflessness and dedication of teachers and to show our respect for  the teaching profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we know that good teachers make a tremendous difference to our Nation's youth. During the last decade, a body of evidence has grown to support the notion that teacher quality is the single most important factor outside of the home in affecting student achievement. Teachers serve as excellent role models and instill a love for knowledge and lifelong learning in our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that teaching is an important profession that deserves our support and respect. Teachers have the important job of helping to shape tomorrow's leaders. Those in the teaching profession work tirelessly for little reward, and good teachers constantly reflect on their lessons and modify instruction to reach the diverse needs of the students in their classrooms. Quality teachers hone their skills and are experts not only in the subject matter, but also in connecting with young people and  making learning come alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, research has also shown us the negative impacts of teacher shortages. It is important and imperative that schools and communities support teachers. National Teacher Appreciation Week is an opportunity for all of us to pursue and recognize the selfless dedication of our educators. It is also an opportunity for us to recognize the importance of education and make absolutely certain that every child in America has the greatest opportunity to achieve this commodity that we call education.  So we have to search our budgets, stretch our imagination and find the resources that are necessary to attract the best and the brightest individuals into the teaching profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, there is no greater profession in our country than that of teaching. I call teachers the salt of the Earth, the pillars of the universe, those individuals who give of themselves each and every day so that others will have the opportunity to connect with this vast reservoir of knowledge that we have to be spread around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am indeed pleased, Mr. Speaker, to join with all of those who urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1130, recognizing the roles and contributions of America's teachers in educating and nurturing our Nation's children and thereby building and enhancing our Nation's civic, cultural and economic well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A teacher's role in student development is irreplaceable. All of our lives have been influenced by the teachers that directed our classrooms, classrooms where students acquire the knowledge necessary to become a part of our Nation's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Showing teachers appreciation and recognition during the upcoming National Teacher Appreciation Week which takes place next week helps to remind us how important teachers are and what an integral role they play in the lives of our Nation's citizens. It is important that we recognize teachers for the critical work they do in improving our Nation in so many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers today devote more of their lives to teaching young people than ever before and spend more time on professional development, their own education and on class preparation outside the classroom. Teachers spend an average of over 50 hours per week on teaching duties and an average of $443  each year out of their own pockets to meet the needs of their students, all the while earning an average annual salary of slightly more than $31,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The future of our Nation's children is dependent on the individuals to make these time, energy and monetary commitments, and they deserve recognition for their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, I certainly am honored to recognize the teachers I had in kindergarten through 12th grade in the New York suburban school district and know but for their support and guidance, I would not have had the opportunity to pursue my dreams, including the dream of serving in this very body, the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Behind the upbringing of my mom and dad, my teachers, Dorothy Mirtz, my third grade teacher who is now 97 years old and still going strong as I visited with her just a few weeks back, my eighth grade teacher, Earl Lucius, who took the lessons of my parents of community service and inspired me to pursue a career in public service, they and so many other teachers and administrators I had the blessing to interact with in my education and career played a critical role in my life, as teachers do in  all of our Nation's children's lives, in the past, the present and the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am honored and pleased to stand in support of this resolution, recognizing the important roles and contributions of America's teachers and support National Teacher Appreciation Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly thank my colleague, Mr. Graves from Missouri, for introducing this resolution, and encourage an "aye" vote in favor of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, teachers plant the seeds of learning in the minds of their students. I support America's teachers and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. This measure recognizes significant roles and contributions that America's teachers have had and continue to have building and enhancing our country's civic, cultural and economic well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Census Bureau reports that there are 6 million teachers in the United States. I, like many others in this House, turned out the way I did because of teachers that were in my background, like my seventh grade Texas history teacher, Mrs. Wilson. She formed early on a desire in my soul to go into public service, and she gets the credit or the blame, whichever people see, for my lifetime career in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I also come from a long line of teachers. My mother was a teacher; my wife is a teacher; my three daughters are teachers, and two of those teach at elementary school level and one of my daughters teaches at Baylor University. And even while I was prosecuting back in Houston, Texas, I spent some time teaching law at the University of Houston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But teaching isn't just a tradition in my family. Teaching has been a tradition in this country since its very inception. Back then, of course, most teaching happened at home under the instruction of parents. Today, parents have many options when it comes to education of their children. Some are taught in private schools, others public schools, some at charter schools, and others continue to home school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers play a primary role in equipping our youth to be good citizens, to take pride in the democratic heritage of our Nation, and to be competitive on the world marketplace of ideas. Teachers spend a long week and long hours teaching our greatest resource, children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, we celebrate National Teachers Week on May 4 through 10, and let's be sure to let teachers know that those, especially that have touched our lives, how important they are. And like the bumper sticker says, "If you can read, thank a teacher."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge a "yes" vote, and again thank all the teachers of our great Nation for their devotion to our Nation's children and for their commitment to bettering the lives of those children and, in doing so, strengthening our Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing I want to thank Representative Platts and Representative Poe for their comments relative to this resolution, and certainly join with them in expressing again tremendous appreciation for all of those in the teaching profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I listened to them, I couldn't help but be reminded of important teachers during my life. I began school in a one-room school, as a matter of fact, in your home State of Arkansas, where one woman, Ms. Beadie King, taught eight grades plus the little primer and the big primer all by herself. But then I was fortunate because, later on, she was the high school English teacher. And there are individuals who would suggest that I sometimes use poems and poetry and pithy words in expression, and  practically all of that really came from Ms. Beadie King. She was unbelievable. As a matter of fact, she walked at least seven, eight miles to school every day to teach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of teachers who give that kind of dedication today. They don't necessarily walk 7, 8 miles, but they go into their pockets and buy materials; they purchase clothing for their students when they don't have the appropriate things to wear; they purchase lunch for students; buy materials for their classes. They give the very best of everything that it is that they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think that we can ever express--I use the opportunity to express appreciation to my wife who taught for more than 30 years, members of my family, my sister who just retired as a principal, my sister-in-law who just retired. And so there are many teachers that all of us stand on their shoulders. Like you, Representative Platts, I know that had not it been for those individuals that I came into contact with growing up, there is no way that I would be standing here this evening  expressing myself as a Member of the greatest body that exists in the world, the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank all of the teachers in America and urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I introduced this resolution to provide the Members of this body the opportunity to express our common thanks and appreciation for our Nation's teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people enter the teaching profession as a calling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other jobs with much better pay, shorter hours and, often times, less hassle than teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, each year thousands of college graduates choose teaching as a profession, in no small part as the result of a personal experience they had with one of their own teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Teacher Appreciation Week is designed to provide a means for students, parents and entire communities to come together and participate in events and activities that show their appreciation for teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Personally, I will be hosting an event in my district to recognize Alesia Hamilton, a first-grade teacher at Edison Elementary School in St. Joseph, Missouri who in accordance with the character and commitment that defines all teachers, has invited into her class as a student Mr. Alferd Williams, a 70-year-old man born into poverty who never had the opportunity to learn how to read, much less receive a formal education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each day, Alesia Hamilton works with Mr. Williams on reading assignments and other tasks that will ultimately help Alferd Williams earn his GED.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what Alesia Hamilton is doing with Mr. Williams is just one example of what teachers do every day to improve the lives of not only their students but the people of our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate my colleagues for the opportunity to offer this resolution on the floor of the House today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to recognize the roles and contributions of America's teachers to building and enhancing our Nation's civic, cultural, and economic well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that we cannot improve schools or ensure student success without good teachers. We know that an engaged teacher can be the difference between kids getting ahead and falling behind. And I'm sure we can all remember a teacher who provided guidance or sparked interest in a new subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill recognizes teachers, but they deserve more than recognition. We have to make sure we are taking tangible steps to assist them. And that means funding for our schools, high quality training, and fair pay. It means making sure that every teacher is prepared to walk into the classroom and every teacher has support through the school day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We trust our Nation's teachers with our most important task--caring for and educating our children. We need to honor their commitment and support that mission.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1130">H. Res. 1130</bill> "Recognizing the roles and contributions of America's teachers to building and enhancing our Nation's civic, cultural, and economic well being," introduced by my distinguished colleague from Missouri, Representative, Sam Graves. This important legislation illustrates a Nation's commitment to recognize the work and fortitude of America's teachers. It is the teacher's remarkable dedication to our students  and their tireless efforts in support of education. These hard workers deserve the care, the admiration, and the benefits they have earned through their honorable service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning, our Nation has recognized the importance of education and has always taken a leading role in its development. Teachers provide an education that represents mankind's potential to turn distant dreams into a practical reality. The expansion of our horizons has been essential for reasons beyond the advances it may provide. An education is a symbol of upward mobility and privileged wisdom. It is the foundation in which we generate innovative technology, methods and ideas that  are used for the advancement of society. A higher education is vital. As we progress in technology and other critical advancements, there is a continuing shift from blue-collar to white-collar occupations; the number of available traditional jobs decline and new jobs demand greater sophistication, expertise, and an advanced degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers are the catalyst to the quality of life and the gatekeepers to extensive knowledge. An instructor's dedication to educating and conveying knowledge is significant to the foundation of America's present and potential strength. Horace Mann, a well-renowned politician and educator, articulated the goals of public schools in the 1800s; not only would the country provide public schools, but there would be a teacher hired by the locals. Education was once decentralized to the level of the  classroom where educators believed their "professional place" was in the classrooms. Instructors viewed teaching as a true profession; however, before long, they were expected to solve problems of society. Teachers were expected to teach health, sexual education, D.A.R.E., driver's education and supplementary courses that were not in conjunction with regular academia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we should continuously honor the teachers who have given their lives in service to this country. May 6, 2008 is Teacher Appreciation Day; this day will celebrate and recognize the valuable services that millions of teachers provide to the nation. Teacher Appreciation Day should be the crescendo of a years long's worth of recognition efforts. All too often, the contributions made by teachers to our country are forgotten. During National Teacher Appreciation Week, which is May 4, 2008,  through May 10, 2008, the profession of teaching is promoted to encourage students, parents, school administrators, and public officials to partake in teacher appreciation events. It is fitting that we take time each year during Teacher Appreciation Week to thank our teachers--as the work they do has a tremendous and very direct effect on the lives of young people. As President Bush has said, "There's nothing more noble than to teach."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The innumerable contributions of teachers are invaluable and shall never go unnoticed. The strategic teaching methods that teachers employ are ostensibly successful. Because of the exceptional work of their students, their involvement should never be disregarded. Teachers and other education staff undeniably deserve the respect of their students and communities for their selfless dedication to community service and the future of our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, and, in-so-doing, honoring teachers and recognizing the lasting contributions they make to our lives.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for <bill type="hr" number="1130">H. Res. 1130</bill>, and for our Nation's teachers. Their hard work and dedication to the students of this Nation is exemplary, and I commend them for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the United States is to remain competitive, if our economy is to continue to grow, our children must have access to quality education, specifically in the areas of science and mathematics. One of the best ways to stimulate the economy is through a well-rounded and well-educated workforce. A quality education provides options for students to achieve the skills necessary to successfully compete in today's demanding job market. And our students would not be able to obtain a quality education  were it not for the dedication of America's educators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers in this Nation are over-worked, and under-appreciated. Teaching has never been an easy profession. The work of teachers extends far beyond the time spent in the classroom, preparing lessons, grading papers, and looking for additional ways to enhance the educational experience in the classroom. We in Congress have not made their jobs any easier. In our, albeit laudable, effort to enhance the performance of our students, we have placed additional requirements on our teachers that demand  more and more of their time. Federal regulations place additional pressure on both teachers and students. Our teachers do not receive nearly enough recognition for the care and concern they show for their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, I take the time to thank the many teachers who helped educate a restless boy that now has the honor of serving in this remarkable institution, the teachers who have guided my children and given them the skills to pursue their dreams, and also my beloved wife, Vicki, who has used her many talents to help teach children with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to show their support for America's teachers by voting in favor of this resolution.</paragraph>
