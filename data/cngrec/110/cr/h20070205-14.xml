    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="h" number="514">H.R. 514</bill>, legislation naming a postal facility in Brooksville, Florida, after Sergeant Lea Robert Mills of the United States Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Mills was killed April 28, 2006, while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in Al Anbar Province, Iraq. He was 21 years old. A native of Masarkytown, Florida, Sergeant Mills joined the Marines in 2002 after graduating from Hernando High School. After his initial service, he renewed his commitment to the Marines and volunteered to serve his country in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He spent only 6 weeks in that country before an improvised explosive device took his life. Sergeant Mills is survived by his wife, Keesha, his parents, Rob and Delores, and his brother, Parker. This young man's death is a tragedy for our Nation and for all those who loved him, but his sacrifice is a triumph of human courage and selflessness. Sergeant Mills is due the gratitude and remembrance of his country and its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From all we know about Sergeant Lea Robert Mills, he was a dedicated and honorable Marine who hoped to make a difference in people's lives. Inspired to volunteer for the military after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Sergeant Mills gave his life fighting for those values we hold dearest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Mills of Masaryktown, Florida, joined the Marines after his graduation from Hernando High School in 2002. He wanted to serve on the front lines in the war on terror, and he wanted to make a difference. Always one to do his best, Sergeant Mills advanced quickly in rank and received many honors, becoming a leader to his beloved Marine comrades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 28, 2006, at age 21, he was killed by a terrorist IED explosion while on patrol in Iraq, leaving behind his young wife, Keesha, and a very loving family. Sergeant Mills was proud to serve his Nation and strongly believed that he was doing the right thing for his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice to his country, I ask all members to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="514">H.R. 514</bill>, which will rename the aviation post office in Brooksville, Florida, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation was, I think, submitted by Ginny Brown-Waite, who is in transit. I hope that if we get to the next bill and I still control time, I could yield her time to speak on this issue, if it is all right with my colleagues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, <bill type="h" number="514">H.R. 514</bill>, which will rename the aviation post office in Brooksville, FL, after Sergeant Lea Robert Mills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lea was a resident of my district in Masaryktown who gave his life for his country while serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 21 years old, Lea was proud to serve his fellow citizens, and even requested to be sent to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After being inspired to volunteer for the military after the September 11 attacks, he felt it was his duty as a Marine to go where the mission was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lea told his father that the marines would give him the best opportunity to make a difference in people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He joined right after graduating from Hernando High School in 2002, and had just recently re-upped for a second stint with the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, he was killed by an lED explosion, leaving behind a young wife and a grieving family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Mills was a true patriot and a brave hero, and our community feels his loss immensely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His dedication to his country and turning his ideals into actions are truly inspiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a sad truth that in a cynical world, we are surprised by courageous acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Learning about Lea from his family and friends helped me to have faith that not everyone is just trying to get by--some are trying to change the world for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that in renaming this post office, we will memorialize Lea's courage and never forget his sacrifice for this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
