  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao recently announced that the rate of workplace injuries and illnesses declined in 2006. This marked the fourth consecutive year America has seen a decrease in injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decline in injury and illness comes as we continue to see an increase in the number of American workers. Even with an increase in the number of opportunities for potential accidents, we have seen a decline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in particular my long-time friend and fellow South Carolinian, OSHA Director Ed Foulke, for the great strides they have made in ensuring that American employers and employees can do their jobs safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must remain vigilant to potential workplace dangers. A safe and healthy workplace not only protects America's hardworking men and women; it also supports our strong and growing economy by creating more efficient and productive industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
