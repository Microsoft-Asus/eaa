    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is an historic day. This is an important piece of legislation, broadly and eagerly supported by virtually every organization in this country seeking to expand the supply of affordable housing for low-income people, and also from the leading business groups that understand the need for an increase in the housing supply. So from the Low Income Housing Coalition and all the homeless groups, over to the National Association of Homebuilders and the National Association of Realtors,  this is a day they have long waited for; and I submit the following for the Record:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OF REALTORS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAR has consistently maintained that homeownership serves as a cornerstone of our democratic system of government. We believe that homeownership continues to be a strong personal and social priority for most Americans. Living in one's own home is a measure of security and success in life. The homeownership rate fell slightly during the recent housing market slowdown. Despite modestly lower home prices in many regions of the country, many deserving American families continue to face obstacles  in their quest to own a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAR has equally and forcefully maintained that rental housing has an immediate and beneficial effect on the prosperity of a community. Rental housing provides a range of housing options that not only attract top employers but also generate local taxes, fees and income that benefit local economies. Sadly, the stock of affordable and available rental units is declining. As a result, approximately 25% of renters spend more than half of their household income on housing costs. Perhaps even more sobering,  there is no location in the country where a household headed by a single minimum-wage worker can afford a two-bedroom rental apartment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2007 President, National Association </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OF HOME BUILDERS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: On behalf of the 235,000 members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am writing to urge your support for <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, which provides grants and other assistance in support of the production, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAHB's members are acutely aware of the significant and urgent unmet housing needs throughout the country, and welcome this initiative to marshal additional resources to improve housing opportunities and conditions in America's communities. In conjunction with efforts to revitalize the Federal Housing Administration, we believe that the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund can improve housing opportunities for those that need it most. As <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> moves forward in the legislative process, NAHB  looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that the new Affordable Housing Trust Fund has income targeting requirements that allow grantees and grant recipients to meet the fullest range of critical housing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, NAHB believes this legislation is an opportunity to help the increasing need for affordable housing, and urges your support for <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> when it comes to the floor this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your attention to our views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joseph M. Stanton,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), the chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, with whom I have been very pleased to work all year in trying to advance the important goal of providing affordable housing for America, one of our greatest social and economic needs.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Chairman Frank, who just spoke, is absolutely correct. This is a very exciting day, a day that so many housing advocates and working people and poor people have been waiting for. They get a chance to see their government responding to one of the most critical needs in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, and I sincerely thank Chairman Frank for his unrelenting efforts to get the Federal Government back in the affordable housing production business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so proud to be part of this committee, to be a cosponsor of this bill and to work with Chairman Frank in not only producing housing under this National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, but for all the other work that has been coming out of this committee under his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this bill could not be more urgent. Mr. Chairman, last week you joined me when I chaired a hearing in the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee that demonstrated that when affordable housing is not produced, homelessness is. The stark bottom line that emerged from the hearing, focused narrowly on reauthorizing the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, is that, nationwide, we haven't made demonstrable progress in reducing the number of households experiencing homelessness  in the past two decades. While some homeless people face personal challenges that require social services or other support, every homeless individual and family shares one common need: Housing they can afford. And there simply is not enough of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, there are 9 million renter households who earn less than 30 percent of area median income, but only 6.2 million units affordable to them. This leaves an absolute deficit of 2.8 affordable rental housing units for our poorest families. This kind of math leads inevitably to widespread homelessness. But I want to emphasize that the National Housing Trust Fund addresses the affordable housing crisis as it affects every level of society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, housing costs are outstripping wages for more households than ever before in recent memory. According to the "Harvard University Study on the State of the Nation's Housing in 2007," 17 million renters and homeowners are paying more than half their incomes in housing costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working is simply no longer a guarantee of being able to afford housing. In Los Angeles, for example, it takes an hourly wage of over $22 an hour to afford a moderately priced two-bedroom apartment, when the minimum wage in California is only $7.50 an hour. Put another way, a two-parent family with both parents working full-time at minimum-wage jobs puts that family less than two-thirds of the way to being able to afford decent housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as a recent Center for Housing Policy study "Paycheck to Paycheck" dramatically shows, many of our Nation's essential workers cannot afford to live in or near the communities where they work. In high-cost communities like Los Angeles where the median home price is $523,000, the income needed to afford a home is far higher than that earned by teachers, police, firefighters, nurses and other key occupations studied. The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund addresses this full range  of housing crises, providing relief to overburdened renters and homeowners, while targeting funds where the need is greatest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize that <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> does so at no additional cost to taxpayers. It is a trust fund in the truest sense, a dedicated source of revenue, separate and apart from the annual appropriations process, reflecting the need for the Federal Government to make a long overdue commitment to affordable housing production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have clearly demonstrated that the fund will be drawn from moneys from the affordable housing fund proposed as part of the GSE reform bill, <bill type="h" number="1427">H.R. 1427</bill>, from Federal Housing Administration savings and other existing revenue streams. I am prepared to debate with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle whether such revenues should be diverted to uses other than addressing the housing needs of America's working families and poorest, disabled individuals. I do not think there is any better  use for them, particularly since both GSE and FHA revenues derive from housing activities that the Federal Government and government-sponsored enterprises engage in, at significant profit to both, I might add.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, it has been 17 years since the Federal Government last enacted a major affordable housing production program, spearheaded in 1990 by, Mr. Chairman, your predecessor, Chairman Gonzalez. The time has long since passed to enact another one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so proud of this legislation. I am so thankful, Chairman Frank, for your leadership. And I am so proud and pleased to have the opportunity at this time in my career not only to work on the committee with you and to chair this subcommittee, but to be able to stand here today and see something about to happen that has been needed for so long.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we start this discussion or debate about this new program, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund program, I think it is important to distinguish between what we disagree on and what we agree on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first thing that we agree on is that Chairman Frank and the members of the majority have a sincere commitment to meeting the housing needs of  low-income Americans, to make housing more affordable for low-income Americans, and we share that need. What we debated in committee, what we have debated on the floor of this House on two previous occasions and now, is how we meet those needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this legislation does is it creates a new National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. This is a new Federal program. In fact, Chairman Frank has said this is the largest expansion of a housing program I think in the last 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a multi-billion dollar program. We say that this is not the way to do it. If we are to address the unmet needs of low-income Americans for affordable housing, this is not the way to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we say that? Because presently there are over 30 Federal programs addressing affordable housing for low-income Americans. In addition to those 30-something programs at HUD, we have FHA and we have the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. What this legislation proposes to do is not reform any of those programs. What it proposes to do is take money from FHA and from the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and transfer that money into a new program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we end up with all the programs we presently have, which it ought to be obvious to everyone apparently are not working. You are talking about the majority of the $35 billion. And when I say "not working," let me say this to the chairman: They are not meeting the needs, or we wouldn't need to create a new program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we are saying is if there is something wrong with the existing program, if there is something wrong with the $35 billion we are presently committing under the HUD programs, if FHA or the GSEs are not doing their job, why come along and create another program? And then if FHA and the GSEs are doing their job, why take money from FHA and the GSEs, particularly because at the same time we are saying to those programs, we want you to play a larger role in the mortgage crisis, the subprime  mortgage crisis in America, but at the same time we are taking money from those programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is what we are debating. We are debating whether or not with all these programs, with the large Federal role in creating low-income affordable housing, why it is necessary to create another large program. As Chairman Frank actually says, this is one of the most significant expansions of Federal programs for low-income Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the creation of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. While I share Chairman Frank's goal of increasing the amount of available affordable housing, I do not think that <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> is the right way to do it. I will make three quick points to explain why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let's look at how the trust fund is financed. Thanks to self-defeating provisions in both the GSE reform and the FHA reauthorization bills, low- and middle-income Americans, including the elderly, are going to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How will it work? It is estimated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two entities that purchase or securitize almost 80 percent of American families' mortgages, will be taxed at more than $3 billion over a 5-year period to pay for the trust fund. Where will they get the money? As publicly traded companies, accountable to their shareholders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will inevitably pass along these new assessments to their customers. America's low- and middle-income homeowners will be footing  the bill. That is not a good plan. It amounts to a mortgage tax on these hard-working, low- and middle-income Americans seeking to secure, maintain or refinance their home mortgages. In short, it is robbing Peter to house Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is worse, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the FHA trust fund provision could include a $370 million surplus in 2008 and a $2.1 billion surplus over the 2008 to 2012 period. Where does this come from? Well, the majority of FHA's surplus would come from reverse mortgage premiums that are paid for by our seniors, suggesting that they have been overcharged. I have supported ideas aimed at giving this surplus back to our seniors in the form of reduced premiums, which the Financial  Services Committee rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would agree with the chairman that the funds for this trust fund should not be used for other purposes that have nothing to do with housing. But here with the FHA funds, in fact, I think that the money should stay in FHA, period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, why are we creating yet another Federal housing program, when we have so many housing programs already in existence, over 100? The National Low Income Housing Coalition cites that nearly 600 housing trust funds have been created in the cities, counties and States in this country, generating more than $1.6 billion per year to support housing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, to the extent that the State programs fall short in some way, I must point to the existing federally administered program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income Americans, the HOME Investment Partnership Program. This program already has the personnel, systems and regulatory oversight in place to accomplish the same objective as the National Housing Trust Fund. Instead of creating a Federal bureaucracy, let's improve on the home loan program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend from Alabama said that there are 30 programs that this would duplicate. I know of one program which helps build family affordable housing. That is what this does. I would yield to the gentleman. Would he name some of the other programs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, what are the 30 programs that help construct, not Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and FHA, he said there were 30 HUD programs that help build affordable family housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield to the gentleman if he would tell me what they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Let me say this to the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I take back my time. I yielded for a specific purpose. He has as much time as I do. I asked him, and he has had time to get the list from people: What is the list of programs that build affordable family housing? Construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>CDBG, those programs under HUD, designate money to all of the States, to many local governments, and to our different territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, you have the HOME program. You have patterned this bill, if you look at it----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I take back my time. I think the gentleman doesn't have 30; he doesn't have three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman please abide by the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made a statement, and I am yielding my time. He has equal time. I don't think there are 30 programs. I don't think they can come up with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HOME program, I agree, there are reasons why this must be in addition to the HOME program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community Development Block Grants are not supposed to be primarily a construction program. Mayors and city council members and others all over the country will be appalled to be told that they are supposed to put CDBG primarily in housing construction; they aren't. It is for a whole variety of programs. People know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do have programs to build housing for the elderly and for the disabled, but there is simply not a list for housing construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the gentleman from Alabama says, Why don't we fix these programs? Of course, the Republican Party was in control of both Houses of Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for 6 years. Apparently, they didn't do anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then says, Why don't we fix FHA and GSE? Well, I was surprised by that, Mr. Chairman. The gentleman knows that this House has, in fact, passed bills that do make reforms in both the FHA and the GSE. For him to say why don't we fix FHA and GSE when he knows we have passed bills to do it seems, to me, strange because we have done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the point. We do have the HOME program. It is subject to annual appropriations. And we do have local  housing trust funds. It is the local housing trust funds that want this bill. The gentlewoman from Illinois mentioned the Low Income Housing Coalition. They are the major driver behind this bill because they understand its importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to supplement the funds. What is the problem with the one program that builds affordable housing, the HOME program, there is not enough money. It competes with other appropriated funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, the argument that somehow we are being unfair to the elderly, in this bill, unlike what happened during the Republican rule, we limit the fees that can be charged to the elderly under the HOME equity mortgage program. We do that. They didn't. We limit what the FHA can charge for mortgage insurance. OMB ordered HUD to raise the fees so they would make even more of a profit. We said you can't do that. We authorized some additional activity. We have limited the fee increases, and we  have taken some of the money from the additional activity, not from fee increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is this: The Republican Party has opposed any funding for affordable housing construction. They inherited the HOME program. They haven't been very good to it in the appropriations process. This says we need to get back in the business in a major way of helping build affordable housing. There is no 30 programs that build affordable housing for low-income people. That is not what CDBG is intended to do, and it is not what CDBG largely does. Most of the money goes for other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This list of 30 programs is mythical. I await its reality, but I don't have any high expectations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia for a colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the fact is that Americans are in a crisis in terms of affordable housing today. This is the most programmatically rational and fiscally responsible way to address that crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support Mr. Frank's bill, and I appreciate him offering this opportunity for the Congress as a whole to show that we really can make a positive difference in people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate some clarification on one aspect of the bill, however. Within the bill, at least 75 percent of the funds are set aside for families whose incomes are no more than 30 percent of the area median income, and at least 10 percent is for people whose income is more than 50 percent of the area median income. That only leaves about 15 percent of the trust fund available to be flexibly used by localities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent the Washington suburbs where housing is extraordinarily high, not dissimilar from the Boston suburbs that the chairman represents. Many of these families and governments are concerned that there will not be the opportunity to address the crisis that their middle-class families are facing in housing. In fact, there are more than 50,000 families in northern Virginia who are paying over 30 percent of their income for housing but who are at about 100 percent of the area median income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I would like to ask the chairman to do is to clarify how we can address that affordable housing need within this bill's parameters.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>First, there was allusion by the gentleman from Alabama to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the bill we passed, which we did do some reforms in, we did say that they should in their secondary mortgage activity be supportive of people at 80 percent of median. We have given them the affordable housing goals, and people who understand this issue understand that there is a distinction, as the gentleman from Virginia understands. Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac have primarily and historically been aimed at helping people in the more moderate income range. We have actually lowered it to 80 percent of median. This gets to people much below that in general, which is why there is no overlap between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, to the gentleman's argument, what we want to do here is give as much flexibility as we can to the local communities. That is why, yes, we are not creating a Federal bureaucracy here. The Federal Government will largely be passing this money through to the State and local housing trust funds who can focus on the needs of their own community. They would have the ability, with the 15 percent, to spend it where they think best. If they thought it was needed for the lowest income people,  they could do that. But if they felt, as in the gentleman's area, this needs to go to people at 60 percent of median, and ultimately when we get the fund up to 80 percent of median, they would have the ability to do that. So the 15 percent is within the discretion of the local communities.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>That is very helpful.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today in favor of greater housing opportunities for working families. I also rise today against adding yet another new Federal Government housing program on top of the roughly 80-plus programs that HUD already administers, and I hold the list in my hand. And since it is called "HUD," ostensibly, these programs have something to do with either affordable housing or urban development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, what we have in front of us again is another classic liberal let's take money away from working families, send it to Washington, and then somehow throw a little bit back at the people. Throw money at the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add, as the chairman brought out as a beneficial feature of this, that the money goes to the States. The last I looked, all but four or five are running a surplus. Unfortunately, there is still a deficit in the Nation's Capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I appreciate the chairman's commitment to affordable housing. I agree with him, there is a need for greater affordable housing. He is very sincere in his passion, and I respect that. But I note that he and other Members on that side of the aisle, unfortunately, constantly vote against affordable housing. The greatest determinant in how affordable your housing is is a paycheck. It's a paycheck, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And almost all the Democrats voted against the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Reconciliation Act of 2003, which created 8.2 million jobs and helped lead to one of the largest rates of homeownership in the entire history of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next biggest determinant in the affordability of housing is once you have that paycheck, how much of it does Uncle Sam take? What is your tax bite? Yet we know, Mr. Chairman, in the budget passed by the Democrat majority, it contains the single largest tax increase in history. We are talking about an average of $3,000 per year on every American family when it is imposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I hear from some of these families. I hear from people like the Stephens family in Mesquite who wrote to me: "Dear Congressman, I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount," talking about the taxes, "would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of tax increase." So much for making housing more affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, many of our friends on the other side of the aisle do not support increased opportunities for trade. They want to put tariffs on the Canadian lumber or the Mexican concrete which leads to homes being less affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there is the regulatory burden. Mr. Chairman, they almost all supported Davis-Bacon provisions which increases the cost of public housing by artificially raising wages. At almost every juncture, the Democrat majority is voting against affordable housing, and those are the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it really comes down to a choice: Do we want more opportunity housing or do we want more government housing? We should support opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to myself because I would like to make one statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as I said at the start of this debate, the trust fund will be the largest expansion in Federal housing programs in decades. That is what we are debating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also at this time I would like to introduce, and I asked back in July for  HUD to produce the list of programs which today promote affordable housing. They sent me a list, and it has actually 34 programs which in some way assist low-income Americans with their housing needs. That is not my list; that is their list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's again focus on, we have all of these programs. Do we rehabilitate these programs or do we shift money from one program to another? And if we are shifting money from one program to another, I don't see how this is the largest expansion of Federal housing programs in decades, or as the gentlewoman from California said, the most significant new program in over 11 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume to underline an important distinction that appears to have escaped the gentleman from Alabama: There is a difference between a section 8 voucher program which gives people money to pay their rent on a year-by-year basis and does not encourage the construction of any housing, there is a difference between that and a program to help people build affordable housing. The gentleman now has disclaimed the list to some  extent. He says it is not his list; it was when he first mentioned it, it seems to me. Now it is HUD's list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a list that he very carefully reworded, the phraseology, I think. It is a list that assists people who are poor with housing. Yes, it builds shelters for the homeless. That is probably one or two of the programs. It gives section 8 vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HOME program is the only one of that list that helps build affordable housing. It helps build it. So the gentleman's list, and he doesn't want to read it, and I understand why. He mentioned Community Development Block Grants. No one familiar with Community Development Block Grants think they are primarily for housing construction. That is not what it does. There are programs that help build housing for the disabled and the elderly. But other than the HOME program, there aren't programs that  help build affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now aimed at helping people at 100 percent of median and above. We say that should be dropped to 80 percent of median, not 100, but it doesn't help people in the lower income categories. There are no such programs. And so that's the answer to what the gentleman said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He keeps talking about, Well, we should fix the programs. Of course for 6 years with a Republican President and a Republican-led Congress, they didn't do much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are fixes this year. The House did try last year on the FHA. We have repeated that. So we do improve the FHA program. We improve the GSE program, and we also take additional nontax dollars and make them available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I await this list of programs that help the construction of affordable rental housing. I think I will wait a very long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only other point I make is that I regret we have limited time. I was sorry that the Ways and Means Committee didn't yield time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) since he talked about trade and taxes, none of which have anything to do with this bill. So maybe Ways and Means owes us a few minutes, and when their bill comes up later, maybe I will come talk about housing to offset the gentleman from Texas talking about trade and taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank, let me commend you for the excellent leadership you have provided on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, never before in the history of this country, the United States of America, have we had as great a need for affordable housing as we need right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We have just come out of perhaps the most devastating storm and natural disaster in the history of our country and the greatest need in that area, not just in the gulf area, but rippling throughout this country as a result of that is affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Chairman, one in seven households now spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing, and on any given night in America, across the width and breadth of this country, nearly 1 million of our people are homeless, including men, women, and children, and nowhere is it targeted to the elderly and the low income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what are we doing with this affordable housing trust fund? We're responding to the hue and the cry of the American people, for we need to make sure that we have affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, yes, we have the HOME program. And there may be coming an amendment on here to strike what we're doing and make it a part of the HOME program. And the HOME program has done some good things, but it does not do the most important things that this country needs now, building and constructing new homes. The HOME program doesn't target that, nor does the HOME program target those in most basic need, the lower income and the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me just explain for my remaining time because I want to show precisely and explain how this trust fund is funded. This is very important. We've had a lot of things said today. This is how it is funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's funded with moneys from the proposed GSE affordable housing fund, <bill type="h" number="1427">H.R. 1427</bill>, which we passed. It also funds it from the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, savings that result from the enactment of the expanding of the American homeownership program. And it does not go or cost any money. It's pay-as-you-go and does not add to the Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The estimated numbers from these funding sources will result in an initial allocation of $800 million to $1 billion to the States and local communities for affordable housing funds, with a 60-40 match with the States and the local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, not only will these moneys be used for construction, the moneys will be used for rehabilitation. They will be very diverse in usage, acquisition, preservation and operating assistance. These moneys will also be used for both rental housing and for down payments and costs for closing assistance for first-time homebuyers, very, very important considerations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we're going to hear a lot from the other side, and I respect my friends on the Republican side, but it is us on the Democratic side that are clearly responding to the needs of the American people here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're creating, yes, and we're expanding. Why? Because the problem has expanded. As I said at the outset, 1 million people every night homeless. We've been ratcheted from one end of this country to the other for displaced people from Katrina, and God knows what else is going to happen with the global warming and the global climate changing. There could be more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, this is a great program. It's a program that is needed. The timing is right, and the American people are expecting us to respond, and the best way to respond to the American people is to establish this affordable housing trust fund.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to start by thanking the chairman, Mr. Frank, for engaging in, as he always does, a really great debate, and I agree with his idea here but I disagree with the principle that he's using to achieve it by expanding and creating a new government program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HOME program, the gentleman before me just spoke of, provides a very similar application of funds, $2 billion a year, to help with rental assistance and affordable housing. Rather than fixing this program and improving it, they are creating a whole other program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, as I said, I disagree with the principle on the size and scope of government and government's role, but Mr. Chairman, there's a common thread running through the agenda of this new Democrat majority, and that common thread is that there's a massive expansion of government. If government is not needed, they will add a little government intervention, and if there's already too much government intervention, they will just expand it even more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we're debating falls squarely into the second category. The bill, so  far as I can tell, is all about more government control of this process. Rather than using the marketplace to improve the affordability of homes, they're creating another government program which redistributes money, in fact, a tax on every mortgage in this country, and then redistribute it to those through a government program. It makes no sense to create another duplicative  program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague from Alabama said, there are already over 30 affordable housing programs within the government. Most of those programs do not, in fact, build houses, but they give rental assistance. They give assistance so people can buy their first home. They give assistance in a number of different categories, but the Federal Government doesn't build homes. We have to allow the private sector to do that, which is what I think is most important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what is especially true in light of the fact that this bill we're debating today creates a new program that is nearly identical to one already existing, the HOME program, which, as I said earlier, is a $2-billion-a-year program, let's fix that program. Let's look at market-based incentives to allow people to afford housing. Let's allow the marketplace to work rather than create another government program, and that's why we should vote against this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How much time remains, Mr. Chairman?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts has 9 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Alabama has 16 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute just to say that the assertion that this is ignoring the private market would be more persuasive to me if it were not for the fact that every organization that is engaged in the private market building of housing disagrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders, neither of which are known for its socialist tendencies, have written letters in support of this bill exactly as it has been presented. They who fully understand the market, and we don't just use boilerplate rhetoric to describe it, understand the importance of interactivity between some public sector participation and the market, and this creates no new government bureaucracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funds existing State and local housing programs. The Federal role will be for HUD by a formula to distribute it. It is a funding mechanism for the State and local authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400653" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and the ranking member, but I also thank the subcommittee chairperson, Maxine Waters, for the fine, stellar job that she has done with this piece of historic legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is an historic occasion with historic opportunities. This historic occasion provides the historic opportunity to not only cast an historic vote but to also be on the right side of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 2, 1964, this House made history when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which, among other things, outlawed discrimination in public accommodations and encouraged desegregation and education. 289 were on the right side of history. They voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 3, 1965, this House again made history with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, benefiting millions of minority voters. 328 were on the right side of history. They voted right when they voted to protect voting rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 10, 1968, this House again made history when it passed the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination in housing. 250 were on the right side of history. They voted for equality of housing opportunities for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we must cast another historic vote, a vote for a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. For the first time in history, in the history of the United States of America, we will have a fund dedicated to making the American Dream of a place to call home a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, yes, there are other housing programs, some say 30, some say more than 30. Every one of them is needed. Every one of them, even under a Republican-controlled House, Republican-controlled Senate, Republican-controlled administration, the programs were not eliminated. Every one of them is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a need for this affordable housing trust fund as well, and I say to my friends, whether we will make history today with our vote is not the question. The question is what side of history will we be on. Will we be on the side of those who need this affordable housing trust fund or will we be on the side of the rhetoric that is in opposition to a needed program?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want us to be clear about something. We hear from the majority this is a historic moment, and I will say to the majority I believe that it is. I believe that it is very significant. I don't believe that what we're debating here is insignificant at all. In fact, I want to yield the chairman 15 seconds to respond, but I believe the chairman himself has said, my recollection, that this trust fund would be the largest expansion of a Federal housing program in decades, and I yield  to the chairman because when I said that before, he shook his head and I don't know if he was shaking his head at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Yes, in decades. I thought the gentleman said 30 years. I would not claim that it was the largest in 30 years, but it certainly has been the largest since the Republicans took power 12 years ago since they tried to kill them all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Back in June, when you released your press statement, you said this trust fund would be the largest expansion of Federal housing in decades and that was June 28.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I would say 20 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>What we're doing here is we're taking money to fund this large expansion of Federal housing, we're not taking it from the 30 existing programs that specifically address low-income housing, elderly, disabled, AIDS, senior citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're taking it from FHA and from the GSEs which actually that money presently today promotes an affordable mortgage for all Americans. So we're taking from low-income, middle-income Americans, we're taking from programs which promote affordable housing for them, and we're transferring it to other Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing it, we're not reforming. There are 80-something programs. The gentleman had said how many programs, are there 80 or 30. There's 80 housing programs, 34 of which specifically address low-income Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding me time, even though we happen to disagree on this issue. I would also like to thank the chairman for his dedication to affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the creation of the affordable housing trust fund. Many States and communities across the Nation have already created State housing trust funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of West Virginia is one of those, and what we've seen in the creation of that West Virginia housing trust fund is the flexibility in the ability to target certain funds to certain projects, and it becomes a very workable and a very adaptable program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The creation of a national trust fund will continue the good work of providing low-income folks with rental assistance, new construction, preservation of existing units, homeownership assistance and many other important programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This trust fund will provide State and local housing authorities with the funding and flexibility to best address the unique housing needs of their communities. Certainly the needs of communities in my home State of West Virginia are drastically different than those in the larger urban areas. For instance, in West Virginia we have a high homeownership, but we also have a definite question about the quality of the housing that people are living in and the rehabilitation of those homes is extremely  important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have an aging population where the different needs and different  housing situations change, and I don't think we are addressing those needs, and I think this Federal housing trust fund could help with us with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I applaud this bill. I applaud the flexibility and adaptability in it, and I'm very much in favor of the ability that this trust fund is going to have to be able to adapt and create housing opportunities for those who need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield to another of our Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this about Members. Two Members on our side have spoken in favor of this program. It is very difficult for Members to oppose a program that actually creates or has at its purpose creating affordable housing. You will see that by the two Members who are speaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I will say that the majority of our Members believe that if you have 80-something programs and they are not working, you have a program, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program which, actually, this program actually says that if HUD doesn't adopt regulations, just simply adopt the regulations and the distribution of that program. So they almost mirror each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If those programs aren't working, why take money from FHA, which is one of the most successful affordable housing programs in America? Why take money away from middle- and low-income Americans to create yet another program? In fact, if you think about that, you are creating two bureaucracies, two programs with all the Federal employees that go into those programs, and you are putting money in one program, and then you are taking it out of that program and you are putting it in another program.  That, in itself, involves a cost to the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, when you take from one Federal program and put it in another, as opposed to appropriate money, to me that's the worst of all worlds from an efficiency standpoint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I appreciate my ranking member, SPENCER BACHUS, who I think is just an outstanding Member of this Congress, for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation, of which I am an original cosponsor, and am grateful to the ranking member for his understanding about these issues and to Chairman Frank and to Chairwoman Waters' outstanding work in bringing this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are some on my side, obviously, who oppose and are uncomfortable with reinjecting the Federal Government into the construction of new housing. I think it's long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is where I come from on this issue. We have an undeniable and pressing need for high-quality, affordable housing, not just in Connecticut, but around the country. We simply cannot wish the problem away. There are steps that can be taken at a local level, such as requiring affordable units to be included in the construction of new housing. But without the Federal Government's assistance, I am concerned we will have a perpetual problem of families struggling with rent payments that consume  50, 60 or 70 percent of their monthly income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Low-income families who are committing such a high percentage of their income to meeting rent are suffocating. There is less money for food, less money for new clothes for the kids and less for taking care of one's health. A Harvard study reported the number of American households paying more than half their incomes on housing increased to 17 million in 2005; 8.2 million renters and 5 million homeowners have suffered severe cost burdens. On any given night we can find three-quarters of a million  Americans homeless. In these great United States, I believe we can do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation addresses the problem in a creative way. The government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who receive significant special treatment under Federal law by not having to pay State or local taxes and who are able to borrow money at a lower rate because of an implicit government backing, will be required to contribute funds in amounts equal to a percentage of their average mortgage portfolio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, expected savings from passage of legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration will be applied to these funds. These funds will be distributed by formula to the States and localities that will subsequently make funds available under a competitive selection process to qualified recipients for the construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing, including both rental housing and homeownership. The results will be directly and quickly realized in our  communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Capital grants and loans for new and rehabilitated housing, land acquisition, homeowners assistance and interest rate buy-downs will be available. The fund targets low-income individuals but also allows localities to address the needs of working-class families. The fund will be adequately flexible but subject to many responsible use restrictions to ensure taxpayers' dollars are well spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also grateful that among the purposes of this bill is the stated goal of building rental housing in mixed income settings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a strong supporter of the HOPE VI program, which requires mixed income reconstruction, I have seen first hand the value of building diverse communities where people of different income levels can live together, learn from one another, and raise their families in a safe and healthy environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleague to support this legislation and again would like to express my appreciation to my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee who made this excellent idea a reality.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island, my neighbor, Mr. Kennedy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank, for his tireless efforts on behalf of affordable housing and say I am astounded to hear my colleagues on the other side bemoan the fact that there is too much effort being made to provide affordable housing in this country. I don't know where they are living. I don't know who they represent. They are certainly not living anywhere that I have been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, my business community is saying that they can't get workers because there aren't enough affordable housing spots for those workers to be able to live so they can actually work in the businesses that they are needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how my Republican friends think that they are somehow on the side of the free market, when the free market isn't going to even work if the workers they need can't even afford the housing they need in order to live where they work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This housing trust fund is a basic concept. I think it's a fantastic idea. It's one that I support wholeheartedly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just would say that this notion that government is bad, bad, bad, it's funny, because it reminds me of the story of the elderly woman jumping up at a senior town hall meeting saying, get your government hands off my Medicare. Medicare, by the way, is a government program, in case everyone hasn't forgotten, and one of the most successful programs that there has ever been, but you wouldn't know that by the way Republicans talk, 3 percent overhead on their Medicare. You never hear that when they  talk about socialization and government programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would just say there is a story about the Englishman and the German and the Russian. All have a genie that says "Give us your wish." The Englishman says, "Oh, I will have Wyoming, a big ranch out in Wyoming." The German says, "I will have a Swiss chalet." The Russian says, "Well, you know what? My neighbor has a barn; destroy it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sounds like the Republicans kind of have the Russian point of view. It doesn't make any sense. Their neighbors can't have it. That's their attitude.</paragraph>

I have never asked that a Member's words be taken down, but I will tell you that I came as close to doing that as I have any time in my 15-year career. For a gentleman to get up and say that we Republicans today have said we don't care about low-income Americans and we think too much money is being spent on these programs, no one has said that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know where he is getting that. I wish he would talk about the  merits of the program as opposed to slamming Republicans, going into Medicaid, Medicare, and those. But I didn't do that, but I will tell you that those last remarks did not represent what anyone on this side has said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, the gentleman from Rhode Island said he was astounded, and he was bemoaning, and wondering who people like me represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, folks that I represent have a very high expectation of this Congress, and the expectation is that it's a Congress that is going to live up to and match the rhetoric of the campaign of 2006. The campaign of 2006, you recall, was a campaign that seemed to focus on living within our means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't hear, as one speaker on the other side of the aisle, the hue and cry of the American people to come up with a new program. I heard the hue and cry of people within my district to live within the means of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am informed that right now the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development is on the order of $35 billion. When I go back to the Sixth District of Illinois, they are not bemoaning, they are not astounded. They have an expectation that we are going to live within our means, that within $35 billion, not $5 billion, not 10, not 15, not 20, not 25, not 30, but $35 billion, that the taxpayers have entrusted to us, that somehow that's not enough, and that the only way that this problem  can get solved is by going to create another fund, another fund that somehow isn't going to have new Federal employees, somehow is going to be cut out of whole cloth and, counterintuitively, from my point of view, is going to create a higher cost of housing borrowing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, with all due respect to the well-intentioned sponsors, this bill falls short, and we can do better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, what we are talking about here today is creating what the chairman of the committee said back in June was the largest expansion of a Federal housing program in decades. How the chairman proposes, and I don't question his motivation, because I know that his motivation is helping low-income Americans. There is a need for low-income affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has disputed my representation that there are 30 some-odd programs that address low-income affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to include the response to my inquiry to HUD, which is a list of 34 programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HUD Programs--Promoting Affordable Housing Opportunities</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Home Investment Partnerships Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Supportive Housing Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. Rural Housing and Economic Development Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>15. Assisted-Living Conversion Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>16. Cooperative Housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>17. Multifamily Rental Housing for Moderate-Income Families Mortgage Insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>18. Existing Multifamily Rental Housing (Section 207/223 (f)).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>19. Mortgage Insurance for Housing for the Elderly (Section 231).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>20. New Construction or Substantial Rehabilitation of Nursing Homes, Intermediate Care Facilities, Board and Care Homes, and Assisted Living Facilities; Purchase or Refinancing of Existing Facilities..</paragraph>
    <paragraph>21. Supplemental Loans for Multifamily Projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>22. Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>23. Multifamily Mortgage Risk-Sharing Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>24. Mark-to-Market Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>25. Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>26. Housing Choice Voucher Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>27. Homeownership Voucher Assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>28. Project-Based Voucher Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>29. Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing (HOPE VI).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>30. Section 3 Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>31. Partnership for Advancing Technologies in Housing (PATH) Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>32. Ginnie Mae I Mortgage-Backed Securities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>33. Ginnie Mae II Mortgage-Backed Securities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>34. Ginnie Mae Multiclass Securities Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You look over those programs and you find HOPE VI, which, I think all Members would agree, supplies low-income housing for America. We have got section 8. We have got programs to rehabilitate nursing homes, to build intermediate care facilities, to establish boarding and care homes, on and on, support for persons with disabilities, persons with AIDS, disaster assistance or homes for those caught in disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Illinois said, $35 billion is going into those programs. But out of all those programs, this program, if you look at where the money is going to be distributed, it actually says that if HUD does not write regulations that will basically take the HOME investment program, it will be distributed to the same agencies for purposes of low-income housing, which is the exact purpose of the HOME program. If the HOME program isn't working, why wouldn't we appropriate money for the  HOME program? If these programs are not working, why would we do that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Several people have said, the gentleman from Texas on the other side said over 50 percent of Americans today are struggling to meet their housing needs. Most of those, most of those low- and middle-income Americans are homeowners, and they are struggling with making their mortgage payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You open the newspapers, you find that foreclosures are at a historic high; yet what is proposed to us today?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is proposed is that we take money from FHA and from Fannie and Freddie, which are both used. One is, FHA, as we all know, is affordable mortgage for low-income, middle-income Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GSEs promote mortgage liquidities. I don't see how you can take money from FHA, take money from the GSEs, fund this program without it affecting FHA and the GSEs. Diverting GSE funds to an affordable housing fund is essentially a tax on the GSEs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who has to pay that tax? That's a tax on their mortgage business. That ultimately is going to be paid by low-income borrowers. The proposal to take FHA receipts, it's going to mean fewer low-income Americans will have access to affordable FHA mortgages in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can't create something from nothing. You can't create a program funded from an established program which supplies Americans with low-income mortgages or supplies liquidity to the mortgage market. You can't take money from those programs without affecting those programs. There are always costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can't, as the chairman said, have the largest expansion of Federal housing programs in decades, take it from FHA and the GSEs, which supply mortgage liquidity. You can't take that kind of money without affecting those programs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>With all these programs, including the HOME program, which, as I said, mirrors the proposal before us today, we need, in conclusion, let's ask ourselves two questions: If all the efforts today, all these programs, 80 programs in all, 30-something programs addressing this, plus FHA and the GSEs, which also have a mission to loan money for  mortgages for multifamily units, if those aren't working, why wouldn't we fix those existing programs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And even if we conclude that we need a new program, a national housing trust fund, why in the world would we go to FHA and the GSEs and ask them to fund those programs at the very time when we're having a subprime mortgage crisis in this country? And we have all asked, we have directed FHA and the GSEs to address this problem, and now we're taking money away from them and ultimately from low- and middle-income Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="PROGRAM AREA: GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I regret to say that my colleague from Alabama does not appear to be familiar with the bills. I will say, this argument that, oh, how can we do this and create a housing trust fund at the moment that we have a subprime crisis has no validity, it's purely tactical, because exactly the same arguments were being made before the subprime crisis. There's an ideological objection to getting the Federal Government in the business of helping build affordable  housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman finally named some of the programs: Building intermediate nursing home facilities, housing for people with AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question to him, repeated and ultimately unanswered was, where are the programs that help build affordable family housing? It is not an annual section 8 voucher program which doesn't help build housing. It's not intermediate nursing home facilities. It's not help for people with AIDS. It's none of those programs. HOPE VI, yes. It exchanges some kind of housing for others. HOPE VI has not resulted in any net addition to housing. We're trying to prevent it from being a net diminution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then says, well, you're taking money from the FHA and they won't help low-income people. Totally and completely false, portraying a total misunderstanding of the bill. In fact, it is the bill that we passed, unlike the bill that passed under the Republicans, that prohibits the FHA from raising mortgage insurance premiums on people and give that money to the Treasury. That was the Republican approach. We capped those fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's where the FHA money comes from. We take the limit that the Republicans allowed to stand for years on the number of home equity mortgages the FHA can insure. We also, unlike the Republicans, limit the amount that the elderly can be charged for the first time under those by the servicers, and we are told by CBO that as we increase the volume of FHA home equity mortgages at a lower price for the elderly than existed under the Republican rule, we will generate money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if we didn't pass this bill, this administration would take that money and put it into the Treasury so it could go help fund the war in Iraq; it could go help fund highway projects, agricultural subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the choice. Do we, having created an additional revenue stream for the FHA, while limiting fees, let it go to the Treasury for agricultural subsidies and the war in Iraq, or do we put it into affordable housing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the GSEs, until we talked about helping build affordable low-income housing, my Republican friends were very critical of the GSEs on the whole. The stockholders were getting too much money and too much return for too little.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing in this bill will increase the amount that people have to pay on the mortgages any iota. What it says is that out of the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we're going to make them divert some of this for these public purposes. So in direct contradiction to what the gentleman says, there are not 34 programs that help build affordable housing. There is one, now there will be two, and I hope the bill passes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. FRANK, for introducing this legislation, as well as for his leadership in bringing this important issue to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in recent months we have seen a crisis in subprime mortgage lending, which has threatened the stability of the housing market and the livelihoods of large numbers of Americans. This Democratic Congress is committed to strengthening the housing market and stabilizing the economy, and this legislation is an important step toward these important goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the lack of regulation by the Federal Government, many loans were accompanied by fraud, inadequate information and other failures of responsible marketing. With exceptionally high (and rising) foreclosure rates across the country, homeowners all over America are losing their homes. Homeowners are surprised to find out that their monthly payments are spiking and they are struggling to make these increasingly high payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sub-prime mortgage crisis has impacted families and communities across the country. Home foreclosure filings rose to 1.2 million in 2006--a 42 percent jump--due to rising mortgage bills and a slowing housing market. In Iowa, 3,445 families experienced foreclosure last year, up 64 percent from 2005. Nationally, as many as 2.4 million sub-prime borrowers have either lost their homes or could lose them in the next few years. I commend the Democratic-led House Financial Services Committee for  its work on this issue, toward achieving a balanced solution that helps stabilize the mortgage market, stops abuses, preserves access to credit, and aids stable homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> establishes a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund to build or preserve 1.5 million homes or apartments over the next 10 years, and it does so without increasing Government spending or the Federal deficit. This legislation is a fiscally responsible way of expanding affordable housing and mortgage loan opportunities for families at risk of foreclosure, while also strengthening consumer protections against future risky loans. <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> initially allocates between $800 million and $1  billion annually, funded through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This funding is given directly to States and local communities, and is targeted to be used for the construction of affordable housing and support for lower income families, who face the greatest housing affordability challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, 17 million households, or one in seven, spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing. On any given night, approximately 750,000 men, women, and children are homeless. Constructing more affordable housing is necessary to help families who have lost their homes in the subprime mortgage crisis or due to a family financial crisis, such as illness or job loss. It will also make significant strides toward reducing homelessness and the number of Americans living in unsafe housing  conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, established by this legislation, must be used for low- and moderate-income families, or those below 80 percent of State or local median income. At least 75 percent of funds must go to extremely low-income families, who are below 30 percent of median income. This legislation also helps the families of our Nation's nurses, teachers, firefighters, and police officers by reserving 10 percent of trust fund money for families who earn between 50 and 80 percent  of the national median income. H.R.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2895 allows these funds to be used for construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, preservation incentives, and operating assistance to facilitate affordability. These funds may be used for both affordable rental housing and for down payment and closing cost assistance by first-time homebuyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, provisions in this legislation ensure equitable distribution of funds across our Nation. Of these funds, 60 percent will go to participating local jurisdictions, and 40 percent will go to States, Indian Tribes, and insular areas. All grantees will be required to make funds available in rural areas, proportionate to identified need in such areas. Eligible recipients of these funds can be any organization, agency, or other entity that has demonstrated the experience and the capacity  to carry out the proposed trust fund activity, including for-profits, nonprofits, and faith-based organizations. Funds may not be used for administrative costs or expenses, political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling, travel expenses, and preparation of or advice on tax returns. Grantees are required to develop systems to ensure program compliance and oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home district in Houston, homelessness remains a significant problem. Houston's homeless population increased to approximately 14,000 in 2005, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and hurricane evacuees remaining in the Houston area could result in the homeless population increasing by some 23,000. Approximately 28 percent of homeless Americans are veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August, I, in coordination with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, hosted a workshop on the introductory concepts and considerations in applying for Housing Tax Credits in Texas. This workshop  was designed to create new incentives for developers to expand business opportunities in housing development, as well as to generate a significant increase in the availability of low-income and affordable housing for the residents of Houston  and Harris County. I believe that an increase in affordable housing and job opportunities will help reduce the high rates of homelessness among Houston residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the 110th Congress has already demonstrated its commitment to moving America in a new direction. This includes strengthening the housing market and stabilizing the economy, particularly after the recent subprime mortgage crisis. This legislation is an important step toward expanding affordable housing and mortgage opportunities for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="PROGRAM AREA: GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One in seven households now spends more than half of its income on housing and nearly one million men, women, and children are homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we claim to be the leader of the free world yet allow so many of our own to be chained by the bonds of poverty?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there are no programs to help build housing for low-income households. This bill will construct affordable housing for the poorest among us who need it the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will help families who have lost their homes in the subprime mortgage crisis or due to a family financial crisis, such as ill health or job loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will also help reduce homelessness and the number of Americans living in unsafe housing conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of this bill, more nurses, teachers, firefighters, and police officers throughout California will have access to affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that no family should have to choose between paying for food and medicine and safe, decent housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> restores our Nation's promise of a decent home for every American family and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the rule for <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> and the underlying bill, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former member of the Financial Services Committee, I helped author--along with our colleague Bernie Sanders and others--the first housing trust fund bill. I am so very pleased that our two great champions of housing, Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Frank have continued this legacy to bring this proposal before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite frankly it's a real shame that in America we have so many people who have found the goal of simply finding shelter for themselves and their families so elusive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that in my district in Oakland, where more than half of all renters are unable to afford the cost of a 2-bedroom apartment, many low-income families often have to choose between food or medicine and housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This doesn't have to be the case, Mr. Chairman. That's why this legislation is crucial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By producing, rehabilitating, and preserving 1.5 million housing units over the next 10 years, this legislation will take steps to end the affordable housing crisis in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By allocating up to $1 billion annually this bill will address one of the most serious social and economic problems facing our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill, 75 percent of all funds will be used to benefit families at the poverty line or 30 percent of local area median income, bringing meaningful assistance to those most at need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important bill that will move our Nation forward in ensuring that all Americans have a decent place to live.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="PROGRAM AREA: GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first let me thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chair Waters for their work on this important, bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund will help provide funding for low-income families who, absent this assistance, may not be able to afford their own home. There are many dedicated Government agencies, non-profits, for-profits and community and faith-based organizations who will seek to participate in this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that the most productive housing projects are funded--projects dedicated to funding sustainable, successful programs--I am proposing an amendment to introduce a measure of longer term accountability to the trust fund application process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill establishes two levels of applicant-centered accountability:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A trust fund applicant must describe the types of projects he intends to support and must establish performance goals, benchmarks and timetables to help measure the projects' success--later, the applicant must produce a report describing the progress of those projects during that fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the applicant is only required to report on his projects for that year, this process, despite its commonsense ambitions--effectively breaks the chain of accountability between the grantee and his projects at the end of the fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will maintain that chain of accountability by requiring that any previous grantee who seeks funding from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund provide as part of his application a progress report on the previous projects funded by his organization with funds from this trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Affordable Housing Trust Fund will produce billions of dollars worth of grants. HUD does not have the resources to monitor all the projects funded with these funds. The government will therefore have to rely on grantees to shoulder part of the burden. When grantees return for additional assistance each year, they will be required to update HUD on the success of their previous trust-funded projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment and help ensure that the real beneficiaries of this important program are the low-income families it was created to help.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400332" topic="PROGRAM AREA: GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, that great Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey said, "The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the disabled."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund meets this moral test. It fills a critical need for vulnerable families, children, the elderly and people with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The shortage of affordable housing is truly a crisis in our country--and it is not restricted to inner cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virtually all of the suburban cities I represent have long waiting lists for affordable housing. I hear stories every week about families living in their cars, veterans living on the streets, seniors having to choose between medicine and housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several of the communities I represent have sponsored "sleepouts" to raise money and awareness of the problem of homelessness and near-homelessness. They have raised millions of dollars and helped thousands of families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the crisis is just too big. The Federal Government has a critical role to play in helping the 14.4 million families with housing needs in our country. The important assistance in this bill can make the difference between stable housing and no housing at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, by setting aside funds for the production, preservation and rehabilitation of affordable housing, this legislation will help those suffering the ravages of poverty, homelessness and near-homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all members to support this important legislation to expand affordable housing for all Americans. Everyone deserves to have a place to sleep every night that is stable and warm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to address the affordable housing crisis in America. It's time to pass the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="PROGRAM AREA: GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Frank and his Committee staff, particularly Scott Olson, for working with me on this important bill to reach a compromise on issues in the bill affecting small states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation as a whole creates a national housing trust fund for the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of an estimated 1.5 million units of affordable housing for low-income families. Along with food, health care, and energy costs, affordable housing can make all the difference in economic survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Vermont, we have a great need for affordable housing. While so many low- and moderate-income households aspire to own their own home, limited supply, rising costs, and other barriers can make this dream out of reach. Beginning in 2005, the new construction of 12,321 owner-occupied homes in Vermont was needed to meet the total demand expected in 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund is the brainchild of my predecessor in the House, Bernie Sanders, and I thank him for getting the ball rolling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful to Chairman Frank for including two items I recommended into the manager's amendment. The first provision will ensure that each State receive at least one half of one percent of funding. For a State agency, there really is a funding level below which it's incredibly inefficient to administer a Federal program. There are always numerous Federal requirements resulting in a tremendous amount of work to comply. In addition, it's hard to raise the expectations of those who would  potentially benefit from the program and then have very little money to deliver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, numerous social programs, including the HOME program to which this trust fund is similar, include small state minimums. For programs that are targeted at a need that is universal, it is a pretty rational argument that a mechanism should be in place to ensure that a portion of funding gets distributed  nationwide. In this case, for something like housing, it is a nationwide issue so the appropriations of Congress should be a nationwide effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision in the manager's amendment says that within the participating local jurisdictions pool of funding, that each State has at least one local jurisdiction receiving funding. Currently in the bill, for a local jurisdiction set to receive less than $750,000, that amount is reduced to zero. Without this guarantee, many small cities and small States risk receiving no funding under this section of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chairman for his excellent work on this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the "National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act." This legislation does a great deal to expand safe and affordable housing opportunities for millions of American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will initially allocate between $800 million to $1 billion annually to States and local communities for affordable housing projects for purposes such as construction and rehabilitation. Funds may also be used for both rental housing and for down payment and closing cost assistance by first-time homebuyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would reach this worthy goal without increasing Government spending or the Federal deficit. The revenue of the fund is supported through fees from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the increase in the number of FHA loans provided for in legislation already passed by the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fund is also targeted; it must be used for low- and moderate-income families, below 80 percent of State or local median income. The bill also prohibits funds from being used for administrative costs or expenses, political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling, travel expenses, and preparation of or advice on tax returns. Any misuse of funds is required to be reimbursed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, now more than ever, is worth supporting to expand affordable housing and mortgage loan opportunities for families at risk. I urge a "yea" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I don't believe any of these are controversial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first thing we do, we had in the committee an adoption of an amount, a minimum amount that would go to each State. Remember, this is largely a distribution to the States. It's not an existing Federal. This would not be administered at the Federal level. It would be sent to the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And some of the smaller States raised a question, and the smaller communities that they might be excluded. Indeed, while this is not exactly what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) had wanted to offer, which I thought was perfectly reasonable, it comes close to, it touches on the same area. So this would make sure that no State would go without, and at least one community in every State would get some funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, we had a provision that really didn't make sense requiring a mixed income requirement in elderly projects. We didn't think that was reasonable, and we take it out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a clarification involving the number of units that go to people who are below 50 percent, and we say that applies to all units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, in response to concerns in the House, we had language that could be better worded. It was somewhat hastily added at the last minute, and I hope it will be improved as we go forward, which seeks to say that no one who is in the country illegally should be allowed to be a resident of one of these projects.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from California, in consultation with a number of groups, put this forward, and it's to give more flexibility to the recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from California who will explain the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank, I applaud you for your willingness to modify the trust fund proposal as it has moved through this Chamber to reflect the realities of the housing market while simultaneously keeping your eye on the prize, a significant increase in the production of affordable housing for the very poorest Americans. This amendment continues to maintain such a balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me share some simple math with my colleagues. The monthly SSI payment in California is $836. As the Brooke amendment established, the Federal Government considers an affordable rent to be 30 percent of that income, or $250 per month. Nobody can operate housing anywhere in California, much less in high-cost areas like Los Angeles, for $250 per unit monthly. It doesn't matter whether you're a nonprofit or for-profit or whether you have significant debt service on loans for the capital, or if  someone has just handed you a brand new building for free. As the green eye shade types in the real estate business say, it just "doesn't pencil out."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This need to address the operating cost shortfall in projects targeted to the lowest income folks, especially those at SSI income levels and below, is not news to those of us who have been fighting for a national affordable housing trust fund for over half a decade. Nor, to be clear, does it suggest that there's any shortage of need for plain old low-cost bricks and sticks capital grants which will comprise the vast majority of funding under <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, even if this amendment is adopted. What  has become clear, though, is that the State and local housing agencies need some flexibility with the trust fund dollars to address the operating shortfall issue in order for the trust fund to generate the greatest number of new units for the poorest, most disabled residents of trust fund projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Critically, neither this amendment nor the underlying bill discourages grantees from seeking other sources of operating subsidies or rental assistance. Indeed, it requires as much. Even the full 10 percent of the trust fund in a given year, should States and localities choose to use the maximum permitted to operate accounts, will not come close to providing the total amount of operating subsidy needed to achieve the trust fund's targeting goals. So grantees like my own California Housing Finance  Agency or Los  Angeles City Housing Department will have no choice but to leverage trust funds with section 8, McKinney-Vento subsidies and State or local rental assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this flexibility will ensure that some projects can move forward that otherwise could not in the current environment, where section 8, for example, has been under attack since the moment the trust fund movement began. That is the essence of the trust fund bill that you have championed, Chairman Frank, recognizing and overcoming the obstacles to affordable housing production for the poorest people in this country. This amendment is wholly consistent with that goal, and I urge my colleagues  to support that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I do not oppose this amendment. I think some of us had a concern early on that converting any of these monies to operating monies was a precedent we didn't want to move down. I think the purpose of the bill is to build housing. Although I believe this does help some of our very low income families, we would hope that they would not have to use any of that allocation for that. But this amendment does give them the flexibility to do that, and so we will support this  amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>. I commend Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters and the full committee for their work on this legislation, and particularly the work of Ranking Members Bachus and Biggert as well as those that I have complimented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of my amendment is to include flood and disaster specific insurance counseling in the home ownership counseling criteria for beneficiaries of the trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that we're all concerned about the current instability in the housing market, and increasing foreclosure rates around this country, and especially in places like where I live. One of every 50 households in my congressional district have filed for foreclosure already this year. All of us know that that's unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the unfortunate truth is that many of these foreclosures have come from a lack of financial literacy and limited understanding of all the costs associated with owning a home. In many regions of our Nation more prone to disasters, appropriate insurance is one of many added costs of homeownership that can push people to the edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And when you are on the edge, staying in your home or returning to your home after a disaster rests on having the right insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't even need to point out to the Members the tragedies of withheld insurance from many of the victims in Hurricane Katrina. Knowledge of the specifics and nuances in disaster and flood insurance policies will encourage further financial empowerment and homeownership stability among our Nation's most vulnerable populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to support the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment reflects homeownership counseling criteria which I initially included in the Workforce Housing Act of 2006, a bill which I introduced last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While my legislation from the 109th Congress focused on developing mortgage down-payment accounts and other development incentives, local and state housing trust funds have also been very effective in providing access to affordable housing. I applaud the approach of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, which will take these local successes even further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I commend my friends Chairman FRANK and Chairwoman WATERS for shepherding this legislation to the floor and considering my contribution to their fine work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I think anytime that we can make sure that our people involved in housing, homeowners, renters, everybody, has the appropriate counseling is a good strategy, because in many cases what we find is people lose their assets or lose opportunities because they did not take advantage of some of the things that are available to them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Washington has been a strong advocate of energy efficiency and reducing excess energy costs. He approached the committee and argued that it would be very useful to have in the bill the language of this amendment, which says that you will take into account, in making the grants, the extent to which the money would reduce utility costs for residents. This would, of course, have the dual advantage of making it less expensive for these  low-income residents and also conserving energy. So it seemed to us an entirely reasonable approach, and I was glad to tell the gentleman from Washington that I agree with him and, in fact, to serve as his designee in offering it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, certainly I think that anytime we are  going to be investing Federal dollars in any housing in the future, we need to make the sure the houses are as energy efficient as they possibly can be. And as I understand the gentleman's amendment, this would be about making sure, in consideration for granting funds for that, that the construction, the design, all of the phases of creating housing in this country would take into account  the utility costs and, hopefully, the overall operating costs of those projects.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we have in our committee been working hard to try to incorporate pro-environmental, energy-saving measures, measures that would reduce global warming. And this is an amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode Island that is very much in tune with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for further elaboration, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I appreciate his leadership in guiding the committee to deal with issues of affordable housing, the crisis that plagues our country dealing with the mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are serious about providing affordable housing for families, then we need to be serious about building that housing in a sustainable fashion. Energy costs are increasing much faster than family incomes. Green homes are often 30 percent more energy efficient; that can cut utility costs by hundreds of dollars a year from the outset and an amount that is going to compound over time. We need to do well by our environment but we also need to save families' hard-earned money.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H11434]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also strong evidence that green homes are also healthier homes. More than 4 million American children have asthma, and it is estimated that had more than 40 percent of diagnosed asthma is due to residential exposure. Green homes use building practices and materials that minimize moisture, that provide proper ventilation, that prevent infestation and avoid toxic materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity last night in Portland, OR, to be part of a celebration for our Oregon's architectural foundation, and these folks are zeroing in on practices that make a difference and add value. Many of the advantages of "going green" are based on people just having the fundamental information. There is a great deal of misinformation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would provide a "green housing clearinghouse" that will provide fundamental information for people who are involved with the industry. It requires grantees to self-certify how many of the total units they build with the grants were green. This will help keep the grantees accountable. It gives HUD important information on how many affordable housing units are, in fact, green. And I think it's going to be an important step, low cost, high impact, that is going to promote the housing  in this arena to be of the highest quality and most sustainable practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>So one of the things that you and I have talked about is we want to try to make this money go as far as we possibly can and avoid as much duplication as we can.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is absolutely right. And that same issue, as he knows, is arising in the context of our work on HOPE VI. We want to do the green building standards. We want to do them in a way that will be sensible and reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be very clear. There aren't enough law enforcement people in the world to make this work if there isn't a willingness on the part of those involved to do it. If people think it is too rigid or inflexible, it's just not going to work as well. I think we have a wide willingness now on the part of the homebuilders and others to be participating in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, yes, we will make this very much a collaborative enterprise. Of course if the gentleman's substitute were to pass, it wouldn't be relevant. But in case it didn't, we will work together.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a very reasonable and thoughtful amendment from the gentleman from Maryland. What it says is that we hope this program is established, we hope that there will be entities that will be repeat applicants. We just want to make explicit that if people have gotten a grant and now come back for another one, they be very explicit about what they have done with it. It is, I think, a very useful kind of oversight that's built into the program. It may seem  obvious, but we sometimes read about people getting renewed programs when they haven't done a very good job in the last one. This won't make that absolutely impossible, but it will make it less likely. I think it is a very useful amendment by the gentleman from Maryland, and I hope it's adopted.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was really tempted here to let the chairman be my designee on this, with the hopes that I would have the same success on my amendment as he had on those that he was acting as designee on, but since I'm here, I'll act in my own behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, one of the things we've heard a lot today about is that there is a need for making sure that we are taking care of our most neediest Americans when it comes to their housing needs. What we've also learned, though, is that there are a lot of programs out there, 70 something housing programs, 30 some odd that may be addressed as some form of housing for our low-income citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that I think the American people are kind of concerned about is they keep hearing that government solution to all of the problems. If we're not doing a good job with the programs we have, let's add another program, and I think they're getting kind of tired of that. So one of the things that my amendment does is it makes an existing program, it incorporates many of the good ideas, and may I say, Mr. Chairman, there are some good ideas that have come in this particular piece of  legislation, updating it. And what I'm talking about is the HOME program. The HOME program currently does a lot of the functions. In fact, when you look at the HOME program in this bill, many of those overlap. And yet we're now going to separate into two different funds an affordable housing fund and a HOME program. Instead of using the combined resources of those two programs to help further the housing situation, we're going to have two different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we talk about the fact that we're already spending over $28 billion for affordable housing, low-income housing, and then we're going to take money out of one pocket and put it over to an area separate from that, quite honestly, Congress will not have the opportunity to really sit down and assess, hey, where are the American people, where are the people that are the recipients of low-income money, the people who are benefiting from this housing, where are we getting the best bang for our  buck? But instead, we are separating those programs. I don't think that is good policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other issue here is that many communities, almost every State in the Union, and I think like 350 or 360, maybe it's a larger number, I don't have it in front of me, communities are already participating in the HOME program, they already have some familiarity with that program. And so now we're going to take the ramp-up time of having to learn a new program, to write the rules for it, to do all of the things that it takes to get a new program off the ground. We're going to have to form a new  branch of government within the Department of Housing to be able to ramp up and have the employees that it needs to do this, another inefficiency of adding additional programs to something that maybe we're not satisfied with. And I would agree, there may be some things that need to happen in the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What my amendment also does is says, look, GAO, go in and analyze what's going on, work with the various housing partnerships, let's determine some of the things that we need to do to the HOME program. Let's make those changes, and then let's make the HOME program a better program incorporating many of the good ideas, even that we've seen in some of the amendments here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we had, I believe, seven amendments from the Democratic side, unfortunately, and I appreciate the Rules Committee making mine in order, but I think we had some other good ideas from some of my colleagues on my side of the aisle that we could have incorporated into this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that's the reason I'm down on the floor today offering this amendment. I'm encouraging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you're really serious about two or three things, and let's talk about those things; one, are you interested in making sure that we have the most efficient delivery system to our low-income families to make sure that they have housing? If you're interested in that. Secondly, if you want to do that in a way that's a good steward of the American taxpayer's dollars,  that's another reason to vote for this amendment. And thirdly, if you believe that we ought to be able to prioritize our spending and not separate into a different fund, separate and aside from what we're already doing for a lot of our low-income housing families, then the Neugebauer amendment is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 10 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is an unusual amendment. The actual author offered it, and the Member rising in opposition actually opposes it for the first time today. And I appreciate the cooperation we've had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say that I appreciate, not just that, but the gentleman from Texas, who has been a very constructive member of the committee. We have some differences. That's why we have different parties. But we have a great deal in agreement. And the gentleman's expertise in the homebuilding field has been very helpful as our committee has gone forward. And here is, perhaps, a philosophical difference between us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main difference here is that the gentleman's amendment, recognizing, as he does from his own experience, the value of additional housing construction, would do away with our two funding sources. Now, we chose to go in addition to the HOME program, which is the one program where there is a parallel, for a couple of reasons. First of all, the HOME program is, of course, subject to annual appropriations, and that's appropriate for most government work. But we did want to have in the government  a program for housing construction that had a little bit more assurance for people than an annual appropriation. Appropriations get caught up in omnibus issues, CR issues. The trust fund will be outside of the kind of deadlock that we have had in the past and may, we hope not, but may have in the future. If you're trying to build housing, the notion that your funding has been slowed down because there has been a fight over some unrelated issue, like the debate about the Iraq war funding, could slow you down, we want to avoid that, so we</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we do have two additional funding sources. Now, there is some debate about that. I do want to stress, in the FHA bill, which was already voted on by the House, we say in the first place that if any question arises about the solvency of the fund, if the FHA fund should appear to be in trouble, not a penny can go into the affordable housing fund that year. Only after the HUD Secretary has certified that the money won't be needed to hold down premiums or prevent insolvency will this go  forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have said that by the creation of a new funding stream, namely, allowing an unlimited amount of home equity and mortgages, we get a lot of money that CBO made available. And I should note, by the way, that some of that money, as the gentleman from Texas, among others, have suggested, has gone to upgrade the computer system of the FHA. Some of it will go for a great increase in counseling to homeowners, which is, again, supported on both sides. A good chunk will be left over, we're not sure  exactly how much, we hope it will be $200 million a year. But it only goes to the housing trust fund if it would otherwise have gone to the Treasury. There is zero chance, the way this bill is written, for it to force that kind of an increase. That, by the way, is why CBO gives us a flat score on this. There is no budget deficit situation here at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and here I have to say some of my Republican colleagues have been a little inconsistent, the administration, some of them, they've been critical of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They've said, you know, we give all these advantages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a line of credit, some people think they're government-run, there used to be government members on the board, although we will not have that if our bill passes, and here they are, they're making  all these profits and they're not doing enough for public purposes. Well, in our Fannie and Freddie bill, we amend that to some extent by increasing the housing goals they have by dropping the credit they get from 100 percent to 80 percent immediately. But we also say,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, I find it a little odd that people who have said that we should basically reduce the portfolio of Fannie and Freddie and make them securitize more, which they believe will do more damage to their ability to function  than anything else, that now they become very concerned when we talk about a housing trust fund. I should be clear that that does not describe the gentleman from Texas, who understands very well how best to help Fannie and Freddie.  And I think we put through a bill that will enhance their ability to function while better regulating them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in other words, we have 800 or $900 million, we hope, in the first year, and we hope it will go up. And this is the main difference between us, it doesn't come from appropriated funds. And I believe we have written it so it will not interfere with either Fannie and Freddie or FHA's ability to function. And we do not create a new bureaucracy. We distribute it to the State and local housing funds. Indeed, many of the amendments that we've adopted here in agreement by both sides, and some that  we adopted in committee, I was looking it over, in committee we adopted a number of amendments, more from the Republican side than the Democratic side because I don't have to worry about other people telling me where we are on that. We have, in every one of these amendments, increased the flexibility for the local housing trust funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, I hope that the substitute is defeated and that we will continue to improve this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes remaining; the gentleman from Massachusetts has 4 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>At this time, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert), who is the former ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Neugebauer amendment. I think that we have to look at bureaucracy. And I must say that I think that the existing federally administered program designed to serve the housing needs of low-income Americans, the HOME Investment Partnership Program, is a program that's already in place. It has the personnel system, the regulatory oversight in place to accomplish the same objective as the National Housing Trust Fund. And instead of creating a new Federal bureaucracy  to address low-income housing availability, I think we should focus our efforts on improving the HOME program. Mr. Neugebauer's amendment creates a pilot program, and I think we could call it "HOME Lite," within the HOME program. And so instead of reinventing the wheel and establishing another Federal trust fund and a brand new program, I support improving and being creative with an existing program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look at the HOME program, the staff is already participating, they understand the jurisdictions the HOME program will be looking at, and so there is no learning curve for implementation. Revitalizing the HOME program will be more efficient by having less start-up costs, administrative costs, and the funds will be distributed to the project sooner, and not later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>At the same time, I think the national trust fund would be administered by exactly the same people who will be administering the program in the States and at the local level, so it will be able to allow them to operate under one program instead of two separate programs with a little different objectives but not much. So they will be doing the same thing twice and having to work with two different bureaucracies to establish an affordable housing program. So I think there might be some changes  to the HOME program to align it more closely to some of the things that have been spoken about in the trust fund program. But I think that this would be a good compromise and would still have the trust program that will provide the affordable funding but do it through HUD at a program that has already been established.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just want to close by saying that 50 States, 585 local communities, are already using the HOME program as a model for building and developing low-income housing in their communities. It just makes sense that we take an existing program, make the revisions that have really made, there are some good ideas that have come through this legislation, let's incorporate those ideas into the HOME program. Let's take an existing vehicle. Let's ask the United States Congress  to prioritize where they think that we are getting the most bang for our bucks as we deliver low-income housing programs for the American people and for the people that need them so badly. Let's do it right. The right way to do it is to take this existing program and fold into it many of the good ideas that have come from that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400287" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, without question, as we have heard here today, there is need in this country for affordable housing, particularly for the elderly and the disabled. But when government-financed, low-income housing is occupied by able-bodied adults who have chosen not to work, they are displacing these very people who are the most needy; the elderly, the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, Congress and President Clinton agreed that able-bodied adults ought to be required to work if they are going to receive government welfare. Today the proposal that I am putting forward to amend this bill is to extend this same commonsense requirement to the new housing financed by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to make it very clear, Madam Speaker, this proposal does not apply to the elderly or the disabled or single parents of children under 6 years of age who are unable to find appropriate and affordable child care, in addition to many others. But I think we can realize, if you are able-bodied, capable of working or even applying for a job, then American taxpayers expect that in exchange for this taxpayer-financed housing, you will commit to at least 20 hours of work activities per month.  That is minimal part-time work. And work activities can include job training, community service programs, and even providing child care. The work activities requirement is taken from the current standard under the Federal welfare reform program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully expect that the most able-bodied adults who occupy housing financed by this bill will already meet the standards laid out in my amendment. This amendment simply guarantees that taxpayer-financed housing isn't going to turn into free housing for able-bodied adults who are unwilling to work or contribute to society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we should be in the business of providing low-income Americans who are struggling for stability with a hand up, not a handout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you were part of the bipartisan coalition who supported including work requirements in welfare reform, then I strongly urge you to support this proposal as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to try to save the bill from this effort to kill it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is the gentleman opposed to the motion?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>First, if this were a serious effort to put on a work program, it might have been offered as an amendment to the bill. It wasn't offered before the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it would have said "report back forthwith," and it would have been voted on and it would have been  added. It says "promptly." Now it is true that if we were to adopt a motion to recommit that says "promptly," it would go back to the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our committee is a fairly busy one. We have the subprime issue before us. We have credit card reform issues. House floor time is fairly busy. I am told there are Members who don't think working here on Friday is the best thing that has ever happened to them. We are getting towards the end of this session. We have the appropriations bills. So the choice of "promptly" rather than "forthwith" is clearly motivated by animus against the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having failed in several tries to kill the bill as a whole, they now say, let's do it this way. And on its own merits, here is the problem. I have not been a supporter of the work requirement within the public housing area, but at least in public housing you have administered a framework where it can be applied, although I think inappropriately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we are talking about a program whereby the Federal funds will be distributed. And by the way, they are not mostly taxpayer; they are shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dollars in the largest amount. But what we are going to do is distribute this money to hundreds of local housing funds, State and local funds. You talk about unfunded mandates. This says to all of the grantees, the Catholic Church in some places, or B'nai Brith housing or other local housing groups, Habitat for Humanity  or any of the others, you must, in addition to building the housing, undertake to administer this kind of volunteer work program. Lest anyone think this is something that they can do easily, read the third page of the recommittal motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>"Administration. A grantee providing assistance with Trust Fund grant amounts may administer the work activities requirement under this subsection directly, through a resident organization, or through a contractor having experience in administering work activities programs within the jurisdiction of the grantee."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This takes some of the limited amount of money that would be available for housing and creates another new set of contractors. Maybe Blackwater will lay down their guns and come over here now when they get run out of Iraq and so a whole new set of contractors will be dealing with this. And the organizations that get this money, they are religious organizations, they are nonprofits, they are homebuilders. They will now have this new mandate to go and make people work, and it becomes a complicated  one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's what it says. For example, if you are "a single custodial parent for a child who has not attained 6 years of age," then you have to go out and do this volunteer work for 20 hours a week, unless you can show that you couldn't get child care. You've got to show that it's unavailable. There are three different kinds of paragraphs. It's a very complicated thing to administer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you say to people, you know what, thank you for helping build affordable housing, thank you to the archdiocese, thank you to the Methodists, thank you to Habitat for Humanity, thank you to these charitable groups. Oh, and by the way, you are now in charge of making the parents of small children go to work unless they have first shown to you the unavailability of child care, and you have to go out and hire somebody to administer this for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, even if it were "forthwith," I would be opposed to it, but "promptly" means that the people who are opposed to using funding to help build affordable housing want to at best delay the bill, and maybe if they're lucky enough, because they can combine this with other filibusters, kill it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very difficult program to administer. It is not one for which there has been any demand. I guarantee you it will be strongly opposed by all of the organizations, the charitable and nonprofit organizations, that will be told to administer this housing. It is an unfair imposition on some of the best-motivated organizations and people. It doesn't give them any money to do it. It gives them this very difficult task. It delays the bill at best, and I hope it is defeated for what it is meant  to be, an effort to derail a bill that can't be derailed in a more straightforward fashion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, is it not true that if, indeed, this motion passed that this bill could be reported back to the committee or committees to which it has been designated, and then it could be reported back to the whole House tomorrow?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> As the Chair affirmed on May 24, 2000, the adoption of a motion to recommit with instructions to report back promptly sends the bill to committee, whose eventual report, if any, would not be immediately before the House. Unlike the case of a motion to recommit with instructions to report back forthwith, a motion to recommit with "non-forthwith" instructions would not occasion an immediate report on the floor. As the Chair put it on the cited occasion, "at some subsequent  time, the committee could meet and report the bill back to the House." But the Chair cannot say what in the rules of the committee might constrain the timing of any action it might take. Neither can the Chair render an advisory opinion whether points of order available under the rules of the House might preclude further proceedings on the floor.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I regret to inform our Members that our former Member from Illinois, George Sangmeister, has died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Sangmeister served the people of Illinois in the 11th and 4th Congressional Districts from 1989 to 1995, when he retired. George was a wonderful person and served with honor and distinction in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend from Illinois (Mr. Weller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE LATE HONORABLE GEORGE EDWARD SANGMEISTER, FORMER MEMBER OF CONGRESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, JERRY COSTELLO, for yielding and join in honoring the life and service of someone who was a friend to many in this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend and predecessor, George Sangmeister, served in this body for 6 years, representing the district I currently represent, the 11th Congressional District, which was previously numbered as the 4th District of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Sangmeister was born in Frankfurt, Illinois, 76 years ago. He attended Joliet Junior College before entering the military and serving in the Korean War. After returning to private life, he attended Elmhurst College and then earned a law degree from John Marshall Law School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Sangmeister had a distinguished service career of 34 years of public service. He began his practice in private law before becoming a magistrate and justice of the peace for Will County in 1961; in 1964, became Will County State's Attorney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, George Sangmeister was elected as a Democrat to the Illinois House of Representatives; 1976, after two terms in the State house, he was elected to the State senate. George Sangmeister became a respected Democratic leader in the State legislature, and, in 1986, Democratic nominee for Governor, Adlai Stevenson, chose George Sangmeister as his running mate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, George Sangmeister was elected to Congress, served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee where he helped to bring the veterans outpatient clinic to Joliet and worked tirelessly to expand health care benefits for veterans. After three terms in the House, he declined to seek reelection in 1994. He chose to return to private law practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Sangmeister is survived by his wife, Doris; a son, Kurt; a daughter, Kimberly; and four grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my friend JERRY COSTELLO and members of the Illinois delegation in asking this House to honor and remember the late Congressman George Sangmeister for his 34 years of public service to Illinois and our Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400082" topic="MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE LATE HONORABLE GEORGE EDWARD SANGMEISTER, FORMER MEMBER OF CONGRESS">
