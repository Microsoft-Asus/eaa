    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the unveiling of the dedication of the Victims of Communism Memorial here in Washington D.C. It is a replica statue of Lady Liberty, the Lady Liberty that inspired the Chinese students and their fellow people in Tiananmen Square.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was this period of time in which there was great hope within the Chinese people that their desire to breathe free would finally be realized. Yet that hope, that inalienable right, which we all as human beings share, was crushed beneath the tyrant yoke of the Chinese communist party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, at the dedication of that memorial, to not only those students and those Chinese people, yesterday at that dedication, which commemorated all the tens of millions who have died beneath the inhuman atheistic ideology of communism, the President of the United States made his remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to say that I have an enormous amount of respect for the President. He has been a steadfast leader, and I believe he is a good man, but I am saddened by the fact that he missed the opportunity, not to simply and nobly and necessarily commemorate the victims of communism and the triumph of liberty in parts of the world over that invidious ideology, but he missed the opportunity to issue a clarion call for the American people and all free peoples in our world to summon the courage to call  for the end of communist regimes that still exist in our midst, Communist regimes from North Korea, to Cuba and, obviously, to Communist China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For it is easy for people to believe that we had reached the end of history, to view communism as an ideology that is no longer a threat to our freedoms, our way of life and to the way of life to all people, yet it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Cold War ended, we had won the European theater of the battle between freedom and communism, and, yet, hundreds of millions across the globe remained enslaved. It is too little to say to them, good luck finding your freedom. If, we as a free people, are a beacon of hope to all humanity, we must also accept the responsibility that we bear to do everything within our power to ensure that our fellow people have the opportunity to enjoy their freedom, for they are equally God's children,  as are we.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would suggest to the President of the United States that he recall that the struggle, what John F. Kennedy called the bitter twilight struggle between freedom and communism is not over. It is not time for a victory lap. It is time for a rededication of ourselves as a free people of a Nation conceived in liberty to continue our historic and our moral mission to emancipate all humanity from this insidious ideology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For we are a revolutionary country by birth, and we must remain a revolutionary country in present. If we fail that mission we lose part of ourselves, not only our legacy but the legacy we must leave to our children and to all humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I would urge the President of the United States to realize that the victory over communism is not complete and that we as Americans must continue to be champions of human freedom in our world.</paragraph>
