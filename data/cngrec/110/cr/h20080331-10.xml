    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill>, the National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation Act of 2008, was introduced by our colleague from Maine (Mr. Allen). This bill establishes a National Integrated Coastal Ocean Observation System to gather real-time data on the ocean environment, to refine and enhance predictive capabilities, and to provide other immediate societal benefits, such as improved fisheries management and safer navigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Capitalizing on newer and better integrated technologies would help address huge information gaps and significantly advance our understanding of ocean processes. I would say coming from a State called The Ocean State, this is a particularly important piece of legislation, and representing a university that is a recipient of Sea Grants, we are very interested in passing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support passage of this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Committee, I submit the following exchange of letters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Technology,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 27, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN RAHALL: I write to you regarding <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill>, the "National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation Act." This legislation was initially referred to both the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Science and Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill> was marked up by the Committee on Natural Resources on March 12, 2008. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this legislation before the House in an expeditious manner, and, accordingly, I will waive further consideration of this bill in Committee. However, agreeing to waive consideration of this bill should not be construed as the Committee on Science and Technology waiving its jurisdiction over <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I request your support for the appointment of Science and Technology Committee conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this legislation. I also ask that a copy of this letter and your response be placed in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bart Gordon,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House of Representatives, Committee on Natural Resources, </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 27, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your willingness to allow floor consideration of <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill>, the National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation Act, to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to waive your Committee's right to further consideration of <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill>, even though your Committee shares jurisdiction over the bill and has received an additional referral. Of course, this waiver does not prejudice any further jurisdictional claims by your Committee over this legislation or similar language. Furthermore, I agree to support your request for appointment of conferees from the Committee on Science and Technology if a conference is held on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As is customary, I will insert our two letters in the Congressional Record as part of the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill> on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With warm regards, I am</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nick J. Rahall II,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are currently many Federal and State agencies, universities and private entities collecting ocean and coastal observation data. <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill> will coordinate these efforts and create a national integrated coastal and ocean observing system. The national system will provide many benefits to the Nation by support weather, marine forecasts, marine transportation, public safety, scientific research, and public outreach and education activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would just say once again, Madam Speaker, we are in the process as a Nation of taking an assessment of our coastal zones, and in particularly in light of our energy needs, for our wind needs, for the possibility of harnessing the oceans for purposes of energy in our oceans, and, of course, tabulating the effects of global warming. All of these things use data, and those data points can certainly be drawn from the passage of legislation like this that will integrate all of those  data points through a coastal and ocean observatory system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to the author of this legislation, Representative Allen, for the work that he put into authoring it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I would like yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="ALLEN" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for <bill type="h" number="2342">H.R. 2342</bill>, the National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation Act. I commend Chairman Rahall and Chairwoman Bordallo of the Natural Resources Committee for their leadership and foresight in supporting this legislation to give us the tools we need to manage and protect our marine resources and coastal communities. I also want to thank Mr. Brown and Mr. Young for their work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation establishes a nationwide integrated ocean and coastal observing system, based on the internationally acclaimed Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, GoMOOS. That is the acronym, GoMOOS. GoMOOS was developed by Maine oceanographers, and has improved safety for fishermen and boaters, increased understanding of ocean weather and helped forecast the effects of global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation builds on the success of regional programs like GoMOOS and will greatly enhance our knowledge about our oceans and their resources and vastly improve our ability to manage them properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, Pew Oceans Commission, and the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative have all established creation of a comprehensive ocean observing system as a top priority. In fact, Admiral James Watkins, Chair of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and Cochair of the Joint Oceans Commission Initiative, has testified that an oceans observing system, and I quote, "is probably the most important single program. I think if it were to be implemented properly and funded to the  extent we have recommended in our report, it will be one of the most important things we can do for future decision making."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Implementation of the Integrated Ocean Observing System will have a myriad of positive impacts. Implementation will, one, improve predictions of climate change and weather and their effects on coastal communities, including impacts on water and energy management; two, improve the safety and efficiency of marine operations; three, improve national and homeland security, particularly within ports and the Nation's heavily populated coastal regions; and, fourth, enable the sustained use of ocean  and coastal resources and better manage fisheries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to monitoring and forecasting climate change, the Ocean Observing System would protect coastal communities and economic interests of oceangoing industries like shipping and commercial fishing by improving warnings of tsunamis, hurricanes, coastal storms and other natural hazards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Integrated Ocean Observing System is not just another combination of data satellites and buoys. It has real-time and real life practical applications. In the past, regional ocean systems have provided early warnings of harmful algal blooms that can severely impact the shellfish industry. Scientists use the regional system to target testing areas, and managers use it to issue timely and necessary warnings to protect public health. The Coast Guard is another frequent user. They look to the  system for critical information to aid in search and rescue operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fishermen have used Maine's Ocean Observing System for years for real time information on sea conditions and weather. More observations provide more data and allow fishermen to make informed and safe decisions. I would just say in that context that I have had fishermen in Maine tell me that whereas they used to be gambling on what the weather might be 7 to 10 miles offshore, now they can look at their computer, they can get real-time data from a buoy 7 miles offshore and know whether or not it  is safe to go out that distance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many elements of a national ocean observing system are already in place, but currently they operate independently. Legislation is needed to formally define the fiduciary, legal and oversight structure to enable the integration of the disparate components of the ocean, coastal and Great Lakes observing activities. Legislation authorizing an integrated system will ensure the coordination and integration among all the elements of a national system, both Federal and regional, and would provide legal  authority for sharing funds across Federal agencies for implementing IOOS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A national Integrated Ocean Observing system would enable managers at all levels, local, regional and National, to make informed and timely decisions to manage our ocean resources and protect our coastal communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To summarize, what we are talking about is being able to get information about our oceans in the same way and on the same scale that today we get information about the atmosphere, and because of the interconnection of what is happening in the atmosphere and what is happening in the oceans, this will dramatically increase and expand our understanding of both the atmosphere and the oceans. It is an important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
