  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to extend congratulations to two of the citizens of my community, two of my constituents who have made invaluable contributions to the lives of people in the neighborhoods where they live, as well as people throughout America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Tom and Lois Miller became and still are pillars of their community. They raised four daughters, have four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Ever since their marriage, they have been rocks of the Greater Zion Missionary Baptist Church. They are founding members of the 4500 West Congress Block Club in Chicago, and have been active in many other civic and social endeavors. For the past 10 years, they have lived in the village of West Chester, Illinois, where they have immersed  themselves in community life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 50 years is a long time and when you can spend those 50 years in a state of peace, happiness and productive engagement, you have been truly blessed, just as you have been able to bless others. I have been told that "to those to whom much is given, much is expected in return."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Millers have been fortunate to have a great family, great children, grandchildren, friends and relatives. They have given much to those who have known them, and have received much in return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Miller has retired after having worked at Alcola Company for more than 30 years, a productive career. Mrs. Miller established her own business, a beauty shop, that has been in operation now for more than 47 years. And so I simply pause, take this opportunity to commend them for their tremendous civic and religious involvement, wish them well as they celebrate their 50 years of marriage, and trust that they will have many more productive, happy and beneficial years.</paragraph>
