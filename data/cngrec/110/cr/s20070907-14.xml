    <paragraph>Mr. President, I strongly oppose coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization, and was pleased that the fiscal year 2008 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill included a provision prohibiting U.S. funds from going to any organization or program that directly supports such horrific practices. Unfortunately, the amendment offered by Senator Brownback undermined this provision by allowing the President to deny funds to any organization or program that he claims supports  such practices. This administration has misused similar language to deny resources to the United Nations Population Fund simply because this agency has programs in China, where the government practices coercive abortions to enforce its one child policy. In fact, however, the UNFPA's program in China is specifically designed to pressure the Chinese to end the use of coercive tactics, and this amendment would undermine the good work that the UNFPA does.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as we consider legislation to provide funding for our important international development and assistance programs, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the issue of quality basic education and the ways in which increasing access to basic education can improve social, economic, and health  outcomes in countries around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot underestimate the importance of efforts by our Government and its partners around the globe to provide access to education for girls and boys around the world. Basic education is the cornerstone for success in sustainable development. It has a profound impact on the future of individual children, their families, communities, and nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A population that can read, write, and think critically is far more likely to achieve democracy, economic growth, and improved health. A 2004 report by Barbara Herz and Gene Sperling from the Center on Universal Education at the Council on Foreign Relations detailed the benefits that result from investments in education, particular for girls and women. A single year of primary education correlates with a 10 to 20 percent increase in women's wages later in life, and a study of South Asia and Sub-Saharan  Africa found that from 1960 to 1992, equality in education between men and women could have led to nearly 1 percent higher annual per capita GDP growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nor is there any doubt that education saves lives. Educated children are less likely to contract HIV/AIDS and other deadly diseases. Oxfam estimates that if all children completed primary education, 700,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in young people could be prevented each year, totaling 7 million cases in a decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend the Senate for its efforts to significantly increase U.S. investments in basic education in the developing world. Over the last 15 to 20 years, there has been dramatic progress, particularly for girls, in school enrollment around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, our Nation made a commitment to the goal of achieving universal basic education by 2015. Through some of the initiatives and partnership in which our Government is participating with its international partners, such as the Education for All Fast Track Initiative, we have made progress. Since the Fast Track Initiative was launched in 2002, approximately 4 million children each year--both boys and girls--have gained access to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But much more needs to be done. We are not on track to meet our 2015 goal. In order to do so, we would need to help millions more children enter school each year requiring a global financial commitment of more than $7 billion every year. Of the 77 million children who are not in school, three-fifths are girls. Forty-three percent of all out-of-school children are in countries affected by conflict and are often the hardest to reach. Approximately half of the school-age children who start primary  school do not complete it. And there are hundreds of millions more children who are denied the opportunity to complete a secondary school education to become the next generation of doctors, nurses, lawyers, scientists, and teachers. These statistics represent an unconscionable misuse of human potential--a misuse that we can and must remedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced legislation--the Education for All Act--that would enable the U.S. Government to make a significant commitment to reach the 2015 goal and help children in developing countries, particularly areas experiencing conflict or humanitarian emergencies, have access to a quality basic education. But I would also encourage my colleagues to support increased appropriations for basic education programs, and as this legislation moves forward, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that  the United States is in the strongest position to meet its 2015 goal and make education for all a reality. This is not only the right thing to do for the world's children; it is right thing and the smart thing to do for this country.</paragraph>
