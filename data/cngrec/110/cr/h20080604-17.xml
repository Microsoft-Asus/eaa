  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>The national average cost of gasoline at the pump today is $3.98 a gallon. When I was home over the Memorial Day break, one Hoosier after another stopped and asked me the same question. They said, Mike, what is it going to take? What is it going to take for Congress to take action to give the American people more access to American oil?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is today that the Democrat majority thinks that we can tax our way to lower gasoline prices. A few weeks ago, they actually passed legislation suggesting we could actually sue our way to lower gasoline prices. But the American people know the only way to lessen our dependence on foreign oil is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must take action now to allow additional drilling in environmentally responsible ways on American soil off American shores so the American people can increase global supply, reduce the price of oil, and bring real relief to families and businesses and farmers at the pump.</paragraph>
