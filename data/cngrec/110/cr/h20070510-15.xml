    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today this House is again going to consider legislation that would heed the  will of the American people by changing course in Iraq and paving the way for responsible redeployment of our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the President claims that he is interested in cooperation with Congress, his most recent veto threat shows that to him cooperation still means, "I'm the decider, you will do what I say." Well, the American people feel differently. The President is going to have to acknowledge that his course in Iraq is the wrong course, and that it is time to abandon this approach and work with Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering today funds our troops, enhances our ability to go after al Qaeda and ensures benchmarks for the Iraqi Government that will ensure we are not on a road to nowhere in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill sets the stage for responsible winding down of our military involvement in Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the President to sign it.</paragraph>
