    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tomorrow we're going to be voting on a very important piece of legislation. This is the farm bill, something that we reauthorize every 5 years or so, and I would  have hoped that we could have a good debate tomorrow. But I just learned a few minutes ago that the bill will come to the floor under a structured rule which will not allow anybody opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, if you can believe this, this is one of the most expensive, most important pieces of legislation to come before this body in years, and it will come to the floor under a structured rule that does not allow those opposed to the rule to claim time in opposition. This is a bill that the President has said that he will veto. This is a bill that has opposition. But those who favor this farm bill do not want those who oppose the bill to be heard. Imagine that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is time under the rule, as with any bill that comes to the floor, for what's called general debate. If you can think of this, general debate tomorrow will mean that time will simply be split between the majority party, which favors the bill, and those on the minority party who also favor the bill. If you oppose the bill, you cannot claim time in opposition, and you must go and get time, which you may or may not be able to get from your respective party officials or those who are controlling  the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is simply wrong. We shouldn't run the House this way, under Republicans or Democrats. A bill of this importance should be debated, should be debated fully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain a few parts of the bill that I think led to the decision to make this a structured rule where those opposed to the bill cannot claim time in opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have said we had heard that we were going to have some reform in this farm bill. Those who are on farms making millions of dollars on farms in the past have been able to claim massive subsidies. We were told that this was going to change. In fact, what the President said is that we should have a limit of $200,000 adjusted gross income, or AGI. Anything above that and you should not be able to receive subsidies. That sounds reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But instead, in this piece of legislation, you can make in farm income $750,000 in adjusted gross income. As an individual, a single farmer can make that. Remember, that's adjusted gross income. That's your income minus expenses. That's after all expenses are taken out. You can still make as a single farmer $750,000 and receive subsidies. If you're married and you structure it properly, your spouse can also make $750,000. That means you can have adjusted gross income as a couple of $1.5 million  and still receive thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars in subsidy payments from your government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's more, if you're a farmer and the farmer's spouse making up to $1.5 million in adjusted gross income, if you have non-farm income, that can amount to $500,000 in addition, and then if your spouse has non-farm income, that's another $500,000. So you can have a couple making $2.5 million in adjusted gross income. Again, adjusted gross income is your income minus your expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People will point out farming's an expensive venture. There are a lot of expenses, but those are taken out, and you can still have adjusted gross income of $2.5 million and collect subsidies under this bill. Is it any wonder that those who favor this farm bill didn't want anybody to be able to claim time in opposition to the bill tomorrow when we debate it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few other things that should be discussed here. I should mention that over the past couple of years, since we passed the last farm bill, farm incomes have shattered all kinds of records. We have net farm income that will reach $92.3 billion in 2008. That's a 56 percent increase over 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Average household farm income significantly exceeds the national average. In fact, average household income for farmers is $89,434. Why do we have these kind of subsidies for those who are far better off than the average American? It simply doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also some pretty severe budget gimmicks in this bill to make it look like it's coming in under budget when it really isn't. The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, identified numerous gimmicks in both the House and the Senate versions of the bill that, for example, they shift costs outside the 10-year window and unrealistically assume that some of these programs will be ended in 5 years, and we know that they won't, just to fit them under the budget window.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also under this legislation, for the first time that I've seen this, those writing the bill were able to go baseline shopping where you basically say I don't like this year's baseline funding or baseline limit so I'm going to go off last year's baseline limit; that will allow me to spend more. It's like if I were filling out my taxes and I said, well, you know, I could pay less if I claimed last year's income instead of this year's and I would be able to choose that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's what the sponsors of this legislation have done. They've shopped for a cheaper baseline so they could fit more spending. That gimmick should be exposed, and it's no wonder they didn't want anybody to claim time in opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I don't know how anybody in America thinks that we're going to be serious enough to address the entitlement problem we have in this country with Social Security and Medicare if we can't say no to millionaire farmers. How will we ever address entitlements if we can't say no to millionaire farmers?</paragraph>
