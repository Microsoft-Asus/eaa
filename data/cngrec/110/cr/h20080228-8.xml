  <narrative>DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO END SUBSIDIES FOR BIG OIL AND INSTEAD SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1158]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House eliminated wasteful and unnecessary taxpayer subsidies to some of the largest multinational oil companies and instead invested this money in subsidies for regular individuals and businesses who are investing in clean energy. This legislation will not only help ease the pain at the pump for many Americans, but it will also help us get us on the road toward energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill comes shortly after the big five oil companies reported their latest record profits. Earlier this month, for example, ExxonMobil reported earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007, the largest corporate profit in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why should the big oil companies receive billions of dollars in government welfare? Well, they shouldn't. It's simply a waste of taxpayer dollars at the expense of our very necessary drive towards energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the House has acted on legislation that will lower energy costs, improve national security by making us more energy independent and ending wasteful taxpayer subsidies for companies that clearly do not need them.</paragraph>
