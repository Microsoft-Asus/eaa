    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the past few years this administration has been beating the drums of war against Iran. There are parallels against their efforts to try to create a war against Iran and the falsehoods that set us on the path to war against Iraq. We know that the United States intelligence community was able to demonstrate that the administration's claims that Iran had a nuclear weapons program were in fact not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The January 6 incident at the Strait of Hormuth is still another cause for this Congress to look deeply at the administration's Iranian war buildup, because it appears from news reports that the Department of Defense grossly inflated an encounter that took place in the strait, an encounter that was not like any that had taken place before, and then not only inflated it, but fabricated information that would cause the American people to believe that Iran was demonstrating military aggressiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We really have to get off the path of war towards Iran and start working on building diplomatic relations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
