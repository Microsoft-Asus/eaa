  <narrative>IN HONOR OF BOB VALEU -- (Senate - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2339">S2339</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on May 1, 2008, Bob Valeu ends his service to the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 16 years, Bob Valeu has done an outstanding job as the director of my North Dakota Senate offices. His passion for public policy, his dedication to our State and country, and his commitment to excellence have been a hallmark of his service these past years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who serve as Senators get attention for the work we do. But we understand that very often that attention and our accomplishments are a result of some very talented and dedicated staff who work with us to advance the interests of our State and our country. That is certainly the case with Bob Valeu's service to me and to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever an event ended, the lights were turned down, the microphone was turned off, and I had moved on to another event, Bob Valeu was usually still there solving problems and working with people to address their needs. He was that kind of State director--the type every Senator aspires to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob and I have traveled tens of thousands of miles together to every nook and cranny of our State. We have been to every kind of event imaginable: high school convocations, Main Street tours, ribbon cuttings, university commencements, lutefisk dinners, State fairs, karaoke competitions, and chili cookoffs. But beyond all of that--and even more importantly--Bob Valeu had provided wise counsel and advice over the years. And I know that even as he leaves my official staff, he will continue to be  a valuable advisor and a good friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to use this opportunity to publicly thank my friend and a very dedicated American with whom I have been privileged to serve these past 16 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Bob and his wife Marge and their entire family, on behalf of the Senate, I tell you that our country is a better place because of your service. And this Senator is deeply appreciative of the many years of excellence you dedicated to the best interests of our great Nation.</paragraph>
