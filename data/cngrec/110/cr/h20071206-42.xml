    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, back on January 22, I got up here at this very spot because we had passed a bill that week that was going to force the price of gasoline to skyrocket upward. A year later it's up a dollar. Today we passed another anti-energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, there are a number of States in this country who just say we want to use all the energy but we don't want to produce any. So there are States like Texas, Louisiana, a number of States, we're cranking out all the energy we can to help the Nation. This bill we passed today not only says we have got lots of energy we're not going to let anybody produce, but we are going to penalize the States that have been more than team players and we are going to force the price of gasoline higher and  higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope my colleagues across the aisle, as gas goes up towards $5, will also come to the floor and say, "That's right, it's $5 a gallon, and we are proud of it. We did that for you; so you can thank us."</paragraph>
