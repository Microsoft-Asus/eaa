    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank the Blue Cross/Blue Shield of South Carolina Foundation for the hard work on behalf of the citizens of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Foundation is to promote the health and well-being of economically disadvantaged South Carolinians through expanded access to quality and affordable health care. Through the awarding of grants, the foundation provides necessary resources to free clinics, health education programs, and school nursing programs. Realizing that it is often children and young adults most adversely affected by inadequate health care, the foundation focuses on providing grant  money to services that will assist children and adolescents who are either uninsured or underinsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year they have embarked on a state-wide tour to recognize the $1.6 million in grants that they will be awarding. This is part of over $7 million in grants they have awarded since 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the foundation's executive director, Harvey Galloway, and the CEO of Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Ed Sellers, for their strong leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
