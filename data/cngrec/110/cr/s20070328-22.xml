    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today on behalf of the Tuskegee Airmen; specifically, I would like to speak about Dr. James Williams, a Tuskegee Airman, renowned physician, and one of my Las Cruces constituents. He has lived a fascinating life and I think that the following story truly exemplifies why he is deserving of a Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a World War II-era first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, Dr. Williams was put into a terribly difficult situation when he refused a superior White officer's order to sign a base regulation. The effect of this regulation would have been to keep Black officers from entering the White officers' club, tennis courts, and pool. He rightly recognized that a segregated Army was not one that would be able to fight wars together. Because of this act of disobedience, he and 100 other Black officers  were sent to Godman Field, KY, where they were met by 75 armed MPs. Held under house arrest at Godman, some there felt that they were being more closely watched than the German POWs being housed there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, the house arrest only lasted for 5 days before the Black officers were able to show that the White officers looking to keep the base facilities segregated were failing to follow Army regulations. They were quickly released and returned back to Freeman Field. However, a letter of reprimand  stayed in all of their files until 1995, when the Air Force officially vindicated them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though Dr. Williams's unit never saw action in the European theater, they did fight against racism and for equality while serving our Nation. His contributions to this fight did not end with his military career. As a surgeon and the president of the Cook County Physicians Association, he worked to end discrimination in Chicago area hospitals. He met with President Kennedy on the issue and also served as Dr. Martin Luther King's physician when he was in Chicago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Mexico is lucky to have such a great man as a constituent and I am pleased to see that he and his comrades have finally received their Congressional gold medals. It is late in coming, but I believe it demonstrates that our Nation recognizes his fight as our own. Using Dr. Williams's selfless example, I will continue working to ensure equality for all Americans and end discrimination of all kinds.</paragraph>
