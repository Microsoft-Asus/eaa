  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to address the continuing tragedy of racial and ethnic disparities in America. I want to commend my colleague, the gentlelady from Ohio, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and my colleague, our great Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Carolyn Kilpatrick, for tonight calling us all together later in a Special Order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to talk just very briefly in support of the efforts of my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to highlight health care as a central and important policy issue in the 110th Congress and to call for an end to racial and ethnic health disparities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must no longer turn a blind eye to the continuing pattern of racial bias in the delivery of health care in America. The fact is that if you are a person of color, are poor or speak a different language and walk into a hospital in need of care, you are less likely to be diagnosed correctly, less likely to receive the accepted standard of care and less likely to walk out. It is a death sentence for millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appalling that our Nation cannot commit the resources necessary to eliminate once and for all the devastating impact of unequal health care delivery in America. We must root out the causes of the continuing discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities in our health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must increase the diversity in the professional health care provider workforce. Health care must be delivered in a culturally and linguistically appropriate way without having to turn to intermediaries or family members to relay private information, health information. Funding research into the reasons for the different rates of disease incidence and minority populations must be a national priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Latinos and African Americans make up over 25 percent of the U.S. population, they account for more than 67 percent of newly reported AIDS cases. Diseases that primarily impact communities of color continue to be neglected. We must commit to providing access to comprehensive preventive care, educational outreach, health screenings and follow-up consultation for at-risk populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our health care system is broken. Health care should be a right, not a privilege. We spend more money on health care than any other Nation in the world; yet the United States ranks 23rd, 23rd in infant mortality among industrialized nations. We ranked 67th in immunization rates overall, right behind Botswana. We were first in life expectancy in 1945, and now we rank 20th behind nations like Canada, Britain, France and Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1960s, I lived in Great Britain, and I was exposed to the assurance that the British public had in their access to quality health care with the British national health service. We in America can do better. We must do better. We can ensure that every person in America be treated equally, given a fair and thorough diagnosis and be treated with the most up-to-date treatments that are available. We must remember that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any hospital on any given day or night, in communities with large numbers of people of color and African Americans, the poor, you will witness this terrible health care crisis firsthand. Just go to an emergency room and see who needs medical attention, emergency or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's about time that we invest resources to close these deadly, and that's what they are, they are deadly disparities. We need to enact universal health care for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is the wealthiest industrialized country in the world. It is a shame and disgrace that over 47 million have no health insurance and that such a large percentage are African Americans, Latinos and Asian Pacific Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is wrong with this picture? I just want to commend, again, Congresswoman Tubbs Jones and the Congressional Black Caucus; and also our Tri-Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Asian Pacific American Caucus for insisting, and I mean insisting, that this House of Representatives begin to focus on closing these deadly health care disparities among communities of color.</paragraph>
