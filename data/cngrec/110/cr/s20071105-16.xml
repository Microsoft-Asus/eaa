  <narrative>NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY -- (Senate - November 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13766">S13766</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge National Adoption Awareness Month and National Adoption Day on Nov. 17, 2007. With over 114,000 children available for adoption out of the U.S. foster care system, I think it is crucial to celebrate those lawyers, social workers, officials and, most importantly, parents who help many children move from foster homes to adoptive families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adoption has personally touched my life this year as two new children have been welcomed as members of my family. My son Brendan and his wife Jana recently adopted Trualem, age 11, and Peneal, age 8, from Ethiopia. I am now a proud grandfather of five, and our family is larger and richer with them in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Adoption Day was started in 2000 by the Alliance for Children's Rights, the Freddie Mac Foundation, and the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption and helped complete foster care adoptions in nine jurisdictions in its first year. National Adoption Day has quickly grown since that time. In 2006, a milestone was surpassed, as National Adoption Day was celebrated in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for the first time. In total last year, over 3,300 adoptions were finalized  on National Adoption Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to assisting children in the United States to find stable, loving, and permanent homes. Additionally, I support the goals of National Adoption Day to encourage others to adopt children from foster care, to build stronger ties between local adoption agencies, courts, and adoption advocacy organizations, and to continue to research and learn more about families wanting to adopt and the children waiting to be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that Members of the Senate continue to support ways to make adoption easier and more affordable. Since the cost of adoption can be very high, we ought to do what we can to lessen this initial burden for the exceptional people who provide caring homes for children. Adoption proceedings and legal fees for some domestic adoptions can cost more than $40,000. To ease some of this burden, Congress adopted a $10,000 tax credit for adoption expenses. If we ask individuals to care for and adopt  children, we must provide some relief from the financial burdens associated with that care. The adoption tax credit is an effective vehicle to provide this relief, and it is vitally important that this tax credit does not expire at the end of 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In keeping with the celebration of adoption, this year I am proud to recognize Audrey Kirkpatrick as an Angel in Adoption. Audrey is a social worker with Catholic Social Services in Rapid City, SD. She is an integral part of Catholic Social Services offering her knowledge to fellow employees and often her services to birth mothers and adoptive families 24 hours per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also proud to recognize the Amiotte family, whose portrait is displayed in my front office as a part of the Voice of Adoption Adoptive Family Portrait Project. David and Malinda Amiotte began their foster care experience not planning to adopt. However, after meeting and growing attached to biological siblings Medina and David, and biological sisters JoAnne and Karen, David and Malinda wanted to keep these sibling groups together. Despite challenges with the legal process, adoptions for all  of their children have been finalized, and I wish them many years of happiness in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commitment of adoptive parents in South Dakota and throughout our country to provide children with safe, permanent, and loving homes will, of course, have a positive impact on their lives. As we celebrate National Adoption Awareness Month and National Adoption Day, I call on my colleagues to continue supporting efforts to make adoption easier for parents, children, and other important participants in the adoption process.</paragraph>
