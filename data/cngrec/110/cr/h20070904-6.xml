    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President visited our troops in Anbar province, Iraq. Along with his message of continued resolve to stop enemies, he brought with him the thoughts and prayers of a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are blessed to have the new Greatest Generation who are sacrificing to protect American families by promoting freedom to millions around the world. Their dedication to duty should inspire us all. We must honor their hard work by ensuring that they have our support and the resources to complete the mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming days, Congress will hear from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about conditions on the ground. I hope my colleagues will join me in welcoming their recommendations and listening with an open mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as our soldiers have the courage to stop our enemies, so should we have the strength to make the right decisions that will ensure the safety of our troops and stop additional terrorist attacks on America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
