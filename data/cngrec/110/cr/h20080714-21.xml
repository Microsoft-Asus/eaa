  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas more than 2,000,000 Americans are demonstrating their devotion to the United States and freedom by serving in the United States Armed Forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there are a multitude of family members, including mothers, fathers, siblings, spouses, and children, supporting each member of the Armed Forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, even in peacetime, the family of a member of the Armed Forces makes concessions given the inherent dangers of military service and the frequent relocations resulting in disruption of everyday routine;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, during wartime, family members endure increased sacrifices, forgo time with their loved one, and face increased worry and uncertainty when their loved one serves extended tours overseas or engages in enhanced training activities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas an increasing number of family members have taken on volunteer responsibilities in organizations associated with the Armed Forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the family of a member of the Armed Forces wounded in action willingly accepts the additional role of caregiver, even when it requires postponement of personal goals;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the families of members of the Armed Forces serve as a pillar of strength and encouragement for those serving the interests of the United States at home and abroad; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the families of members of the Armed Forces play a critical role in providing emotional support and readjustment assistance as members transition from military life to civilian life: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Current Resolution 295, which expresses the deep appreciation of Congress to the families of members of the United States Armed Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Over 2 million American men and women are serving in the Armed Forces today. These military men and women have parents, spouses, and children who are being asked to sacrifice their time with their loved one. Given the high operational tempo, these families have faced continued and sustained separation from their servicemember, many of whom have been deployed more than one time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Living without the support of a beloved servicemember can be a daily struggle, and especially so for young children. Even so, our military families rise to the challenge with incredible strength and perseverance. These families are proud to know that the sacrifices that they and their loved one makes are to serve the country they love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a member returns home, it is our military families who are there for warriors. They provide our first line of defense to ensure that warriors who are wounded or need assistance receive the help that they have earned and deserve. Families are often the first to identify the needs of their loved one and to help ensure that those needs are met. Many families have made tremendous sacrifices to support their wounded warrior, often giving up their own personal goals to ensure that our wounded  warriors are well cared for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military families are also unsurpassed in their devotion to their military communities. We depend on military family members who volunteer to support units and other families. As the demand has only increased over time with repeated deployments, the responsibilities that these family members have undertaken has also increased tenfold. These are Americans who answer the call in their hearts to serve the men and women who protect our homeland. Their strength, compassion, and unselfish sacrifice  truly epitomize all that is good about the American spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 295 is our way in the Congress of expressing our sincerest appreciation to our military families for the unwavering support that they give to the men and women who serve to keep the United States safe. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this very important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 295, which expresses the deepest appreciation of Congress to the families of members of the United States Armed Forces. I would like to thank Mr. Bilirakis of Florida for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute today to the force behind the force: the military family. It has long been known that the military services recruit individuals but we retain families. This has never been more true or more critical than it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The support our troops receive from their loving families--mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, and children--is intangible but it is nothing less than a powerful force multiplier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today millions of Americans have one or more family members serving in the Armed Forces. These incredible families attempt to lead normal lives while their loved ones stand in harm's way, fulfilling our Nation's oath to serve and protect. The strength of the military family is astounding. Military parents give their sons and daughters to our Nation and pray relentlessly for their safe return. They look forward to every letter and phone call, while fearing the ringing of the phone and the doorbell  at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate military families, let us not forget the sacrifices of the children. Military children are special in their strength and their maturity. They do not always have "hometowns," but they have a heightened sense of family both in the traditional sense and in the special characteristics of the military community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military families have an uncanny resilience. They are some of the strongest citizens in this country, and I am privileged to recognize them not only today but every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this very important resolution. Without the support of our military families, the Armed Forces would not be the incredible power they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my friend and colleague and leader, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we recall that our Nation has been at war for over 6 years. It is often in times of conflict that our uniformed services are called upon, as in wartime now, to extraordinary duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is their families that we seem from time to time to forget, but the support of their families is so very important. They are a very special group. Military families regularly face months of separation, one, two, three, and in some cases, four deployments. Children being born--I recall, Mr. Speaker, not all that long ago coming into port and then helicoptered out to the USS Harry S. Truman and seeing a good number of sailors being allowed to leave the ship first to meet their family  and to meet the newborn children of those families that they had never seen before. Stories of children being born, of precious moments like graduations and birthdays being separated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important that we in Congress recognize the importance and give moral support and comfort and thanks to those military families who bond together in times of crisis and help each other. And I think it's incumbent upon every American not only to say thanks and show appreciation to those we see in uniform but to do the same thing for the spouses and the children in those wonderful families.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="295">H. Con. Res. 295</bill>, which I introduced. I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for allowing this resolution to come to the floor. I also want to thank Mr. Courtney and, of course, Mr. Rogers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the many things that make our Nation so great is our strong and valiant military. The strength, courage, and dedication of the men and women in uniform keep us safe at home from threats abroad. While Congress rightfully has and continues to recognize these men and women, so too should we honor their family members who serve as constant pillars of strength for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Behind each and every one of the more than 2 million individuals serving in the United States Armed Forces is a multitude of family members, be it mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, aunts, uncles, extended family, offering encouragement and providing the emotional and physical support our defenders need to successfully protect our Nation. These family members make daily sacrifices as they forgo time with their loved ones and face increased worry and uncertainty as members of the Armed  Forces serve extended tours abroad and engage in more frequent training missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even under the most difficult circumstances, when one of our soldiers is wounded in action, these families willingly take on the role of caregiver. They selflessly postpone their personal goals and rearrange their lives to meet the physical and emotional needs of their loved ones as they transition back to civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our members of the Armed Forces are able to exhibit the level of strength and devotion that is their trademark, in part because of the network of support that they know they have at home. That is why I have introduced <bill type="hc" number="295">H. Con. Res. 295</bill>, which recognizes the integral role the families of our servicemembers play in defense of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and privilege that I rise today to express my deepest appreciation to the immediate and extended families of the members of the Armed Forces for their unwavering support that they provide to our Nation's heroes. I urge all my colleagues to do the same by supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
