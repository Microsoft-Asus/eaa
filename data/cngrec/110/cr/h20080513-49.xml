  <narrative>COAL TO LIQUID TECHNOLOGIES -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3753]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we just took an interesting vote on the floor a few minutes ago, and that was to stop filling the SPR and make sure there's 70,000 barrels on the market. The projections by my friends on the other side is that this will affect the cost from 5 cents to 25 cents per gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just think what putting a million barrels of crude oil into the market--and we can do that by bringing on more supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've been on the floor numerous times to talk about coal to liquid technologies. We have 250 years worth of coal in the Illinois coal basin alone. Turning that into liquid fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of as great importance is the Outer Continental Shelf, billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, off-limits based upon policies enacted here in this House. And if 70,000 barrels will do 5 to 25 cents a gallon, just think what a million barrels of crude oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have one problem. We haven't built a refinery in 32 years.</paragraph>
