  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - August 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10531">S10531</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today there will be 30 minutes of morning business, and it will all be under the control of the Republicans. Following that time, the Senate will resume consideration of the children's health bill and then conduct 30 minutes of debate with respect to the Ensign amendment. That time will be equally divided and controlled between Senators Ensign and Baucus. Upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate will vote in relation to the Ensign amendment.  Following the disposition of the Ensign amendment, the managers hope to come to a short agreement with respect to the Gregg amendment and have a vote shortly thereafter. Senator Byrd is to be recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes at 12 noon. Other votes with respect to the bill are expected today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have two major amendments we have been told exist with respect to this children's health legislation. One will be offered by Senator Kerry, which is going to increase the amount of money we believe is needed in this legislation. The other is by Senators Lott and Kyl, which is a substitute amendment. I hope those Senators who are going to offer those amendments will come and do them quickly. We need these two amendments. That is what this legislation  is all about. Other individuals also have a right to offer amendments, but I do hope those two amendments will be offered very quickly. We need to finish this bill. We are going to finish this bill before we leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, everybody knows we have, in the morning, the cloture vote on ethics and lobbying. We will do that an hour after we come in in the morning. I very much appreciate the willingness of the minority to work with us and that we didn't have to go--because it was a privileged piece of legislation that came from the House, that we didn't have to waste time from last night until tomorrow morning. I appreciate very much the Republicans allowing us to work on this legislation today. It would have  been a wasted day otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can get a lot of work done on SCHIP today. I will speak with Senator McConnell as to when, if at all--and I hope it is not necessary--we will file cloture on SCHIP to finish it. I hope we don't have to do that. We had good luck last week on the first appropriations bill and not having to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have one other must-do item before we leave here, and that deals with the surveillance program that everybody has read about and knows about. That has to be done. I had a briefing meeting with Admiral McConnell this morning, and he has sent some proposed changes to the legislation up here. It is already here. We hope that will be enough to have that legislation pass quickly. I hope we can get it done. It is something on which we all acknowledge we should give it the old college try and do  everything we can to complete that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the things we must do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other things we would like to do. One of them is the competitiveness bill, which is very important. It is such an interesting piece of legislation. In conversations with the most liberal members of my caucus, I find that they  love this piece of legislation, as do moderates and conservatives in my caucus, and it is the same with the Republicans. They think this legislation is very good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my friend from Tennessee on the floor who worked with Senator Bingaman on this early on. I hope we can do this before we leave. It is my understanding that the conference, if not completed, is virtually completed. It would be good to do that before we leave. It would show real bipartisanship.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know others are waiting to begin morning business. Let me first add my hope with the majority leader that we will be able to move through these bills with some expeditious action this week. There has been so much delay in the Chamber. I know the majority leader wishes to move through and get these things done. I hope we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to mention to the Senator from Nevada that I have offered to the children's health insurance bill the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I did that yesterday as an amendment. There are 3 million children benefitted by the children's health insurance bill, but there are 2 million American Indians who are subject to full-scale health care rationing. It is unbelievable what is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had 11 separate bills introduced in the Congress since the authorization for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act expired some years ago, and none of them have moved. So I offered the amendment because I felt I had to do it to the Children's Health Insurance Program that is on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I indicated yesterday, however, in response to Senator Baucus, who said that he would mark up on September 12 in the Finance Committee the portions of the bill relevant to them, I indicated I would withdraw my amendment from the children's health bill if I could get a commitment to get the Indian health care bill to the floor of the Senate. I have already marked up the Indian health bill in the Indian Affairs Committee, my committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is urgent. We have a problem with respect to rationing of health care with American Indians. I ask my colleague--and I know we have visited about it, and I know how strongly he supports American Indians and health care for them--can we have a commitment to get the Indian health bill to the floor of the Senate? If we can do that, I will withdraw my amendment here in anticipation of having that debate on Indian health in the next couple of months in the Senate.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, a tireless advocate for Native Americans his entire career, I have 22 different tribal organizations in the State of Nevada. You say "rationing" health care. I think that is even being too generous because there is no health care rationed, in many instances, in Nevada. We have gone from having two wonderful hospitals for Native Americans and now we have one that is closed. The other they  don't use for acute care. It is a situation that, for our country, should be an embarrassment. It is an embarrassment. People just don't know how bad it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, through the Chair, that we are going to do this bill this year. If it is reported out of the Finance Committee, we will find a way to bring it to the floor. It is the right thing to do. We talk about people who don't have advocates for them. My tribal organizations in Nevada don't have people back here advocating for them. We need to advocate for them. I have to do that, especially on this issue of health care. They deserve the basic minimum; they deserve the ability to have  some kind of health care. It is in such a state now that I, frankly, don't know what to tell the tribal organizations when they come to see me. There has been more than a decade waiting to do something about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I support my friend from North Dakota and will do everything I can to move this forward and make a commitment that we will do something this session of Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, that commitment of the majority leader is welcome. I observe this: There are few places in this country where someone having a heart attack would be wheeled into an emergency room with a piece of paper attached to their thigh by masking tape that says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the hospital: By the way, if you admit this woman, understand you are on your own because contract health care from the Indian Health Service has run out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very few places in this country will you see that. It describes how unbelievably urgent it is to pass this bill. The commitment from the majority leader is very welcome. It reflects his long-term commitment to deal with Indian issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commitment from Senator Baucus to mark up his portion of the bill on September 12 is welcome. Therefore, when we are back on the children's health bill, I will withdraw my amendment as a result of the commitment to move it separately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
