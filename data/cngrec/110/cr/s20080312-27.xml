  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers, a family-oriented business from my home State of Maine that continues to thrive after 36 years of producing extraordinary furniture. With galleries open in nine locations, including one in South Korea and its newest in Los Angeles, Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers has truly exceeded expectations while staying true to its Maine roots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers' founder, Thomas Moser, began his professional career as a professor both throughout the United States as well as in Saudi Arabia. Shortly after getting married in 1957, Mr. Moser and his wife began purchasing old furniture, refurbishing it, and then reselling it to supplement their income. Realizing how passionately he enjoyed woodworking, Mr. Moser gave up teaching to pursue the legacy that has now propelled his product into a household name. Working with his sons,  Mr. Moser is dedicated to maintaining a family business for years to come and credits his success to his partnership with his wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has always stood out about Thos. Moser is that the company adheres to a creed that stresses function over fashion, creating beautiful works for everyday living. From dining tables and stools to beds, benches, and rocking chairs, Thos. Moser's furniture belies a unique and timeless quality. The company's various collections and pieces have frequently resulted from Mr. Moser's worldwide travels and experiences. The inspiration of Danish furnituremaking provided the impetus for the curved Astral  Bench while the Eastward Stool pays tribute to the famed Japanese-American woodworker George Nakashima. Mr. Moser's furniture additionally celebrates places of natural beauty in Maine, from its largest peak, Mount Katahdin, to the island-laden coastal town of Harpswell,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To continue constructing such superb furniture, and to stay competitive in the woodworking industry, Thos. Moser recently teamed up with the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership to incorporate the Lean manufacturing program into its regular business practices. This program helps workers and management alike think in an innovative, goal-oriented manner, and as a result, many employees at Thos. Moser have taken up leadership positions they never would have attempted otherwise. In all, 35 employees  were trained through the program, but the benefits were far-reaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers grew out of a passion for woodwork, and the current operation has sacrificed none of that early fervor. The company is a strong example of Mainers' determined entrepreneurial spirit, and it shows no signs of letting up. I congratulate Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers and its over 200 employees for their steadfast enthusiasm and committed work ethic, and wish them much continued success.</paragraph>
