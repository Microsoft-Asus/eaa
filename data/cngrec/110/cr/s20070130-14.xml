    <paragraph>Madam President, we are prepared to move ahead on the amendments. We have some that are in the Finance Committee, some in our HELP Committee. We are prepared to move ahead on the Chambliss amendment. We would hope that the Senator might come to the floor to debate it. We are prepared to proceed. Senator Feinstein is prepared to speak on it. I am prepared to debate it. The Finance Committee is in the process of working with Senator Kyl on some of the other matters.  It is 3:15 in the afternoon, and we are prepared to move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand it, Senator DeMint chose not to offer his amendment. So the Chambliss amendment would be the one amendment that is germane postcloture. We are prepared to deal with that at this time. We invite the Senator to come and debate the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard a great deal about how we want to move ahead, how we want to deal with the amendments. We are prepared to do so. I hope the good Senator will choose to come to the floor so we could continue to proceed with this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to talk about a subject that involves common decency and economic fairness--raising the minimum wage. In my State of Montana, thousands of workers struggle just to make ends meet with less than the State's current minimum standard. Twelve counties in Montana have 9 percent of their workforce making less than the State's current minimum wage standard. That makes it virtually impossible for those folks to try to obtain the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising the minimum wage is the first step to empowering the middle class, to making the middle class all it can be. We have talked about and for the last 6, 7 days we have heard about how important it is to raise the minimum wage. Let me tell my colleagues, if we are going to make this country all it can be, we need to show some attention to the middle class. This raising of the minimum wage, make no mistake about it, is the first step to empowering the middle class to make it vibrant once again.  There are many things that can be done and I hope will be done when this 110th Congress goes forward. We are doing the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, people deserve a fair wage for the work they do. The current minimum wage at $5.15 an hour translates into less than $11,000 per year. One can't pay the bills with that kind of income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell my colleagues that as I drove around the State of Montana over the last year and a half, one of the fellows who made one of the biggest impressions on me was at a truck stop, when he asked me what I was going to do for average workers in the State of Montana. I said: What do you have in mind? He said: Currently, I work three jobs, and I still have difficulty making ends meet. What kind of quality of life can a person have working three jobs, struggling every day just to pay basic bills  like heating, lights, and insurance?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that around this country, many States have passed minimum wage laws that have increased the minimum wage. Unfortunately, the leadership has not come from Washington, DC, on this issue; it has come from the States. And I think it is high time that this Congress--and it is unfortunate it hasn't happened before, but it is high time and it is welcomed that this Congress would step to the plate to increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. It is the right thing to do, and it  is a good first step. I will applaud the Senators if we, in fact, get this job done, which I think is entirely appropriate, to increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State of Montana is one of six States that passed initiatives last November raising the minimum wage to a wage higher than the Federal standard. It passed with 73 percent of Montana's voters favoring this minimum wage increase. It is now at $6.50 an hour, indexed for inflation with no tip credit, meal credit, or training wage. This means employers may not count tips or benefits as part of the employee's wage for minimum wage purposes. This is a significant step forward for our workforce, and  I hope the Federal Government will follow suit with passing this bill to make the economic struggles of almost 15 million Americans, including 7.3 million children, a little easier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising the minimum wage is long overdue. It is about time, and it is about time we showed an appreciation for America's workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator from Montana for his statement in support of the minimum wage. He comes from a very special part of this Nation, the northern part of the Rockies. It has great agriculture and farmlands. It has a number of communities--Butte, MT--where there is mining and a number of smaller communities where people have worked in manufacturing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for his statement and for his support. He has been on the floor a good deal of the time during the course of this debate, and having been just elected he brings to the Senate that fresh perspective of what people are thinking about in the heartland of the Nation. His comments bring additional strength to the argument in support of the increase. I express my appreciation to him for his good comments and statement in support of an increase. I thank the Senator.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, Montana is no different from any other State in this Union. We have a lot of hard-working folks who work for every penny they get. Quite frankly, sometimes they feel pretty unappreciated. It wasn't many years ago that we talked about American-made products and how proud we were of them and how proud we were of the workers who made those American-made products. We need to get back on that road once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say, as I said a few minutes earlier, this is long overdue and is something on which I wish the Federal Government would have taken the lead. But better late than never.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Georgia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have amendment No. 118 which is under consideration. After consultation with the Senator from Massachusetts, I am going to withdraw that amendment, but as I withdraw it, I want to say, as we move into the immigration debate, which we will do on the floor of the Senate hopefully sooner rather than later, this amendment will come up again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of this amendment cannot be overstated. There are farmers and ranchers all across America who use a legal workforce versus an illegal workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between now and the time this debate comes up on immigration, I am afraid that by not moving ahead with the adoption of this amendment, we are going to encourage farmers and ranchers in the use of illegal immigrants. But the fact is, we have been debating this minimum wage bill now for 2 weeks or more. It is time to conclude it. This amendment has stirred up some controversy--for the right reasons, because we do need to talk about the amount of money we pay to our workforce in the agricultural  sector. But I do appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts, in his conversations and his commitment to me, that as we move into the immigration debate we will talk about this once again, as we did last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, at this time I withdraw that amendment. I ask unanimous consent to do so.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The amendment is withdrawn.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a new issue. I know my friend and colleague from California is going to speak to the substance of it. The Senator from Georgia raised this during the last debate on the immigration bill. He has spoken about it a number of times earlier in the debate. These are complicated questions and issues that have enormous impact, these wage rate issues, in terms of agriculture across this country. He speaks for his State on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful he is going to withdraw this amendment at this time. I am very hopeful we are going to get to the immigration issue in a timely way. We have it as a high priority on our side to address it. We are very hopeful we are going to get to it in March, this year, and we will have an opportunity both in the committee and on the floor to come to grips with the substance of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say, finally, the adverse wage goes back some 43 or 44 years. It goes back to a time when it was implemented and we had what they call the bracero program, which was a dark side of exploitation of workers from Mexico. It has been in effect, but the Senator is asking now that we get another look at this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the Senator from California will speak on the substance of it. This wage rate has been frozen at a level for the last few years as part of another bill, the AgJOBS bill. But this is an immigration-related issue because we are talking about workers who are going to come from overseas. The Senator has spoken about it. I know he feels strongly about it. We know we are going to consider it in the course of that discussion and debate. But I appreciate the fact that he is not pressing it on  this minimum wage bill. I thank him for it, and we look forward to trying to find a solution to it in the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I listened carefully to the Senator from Massachusetts, and I very much agree with his remarks. I also thank the Senator from Georgia for withdrawing this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment muddies churning waters even more. I think it would be very difficult if put in at this time. The way to go about this is through something called the AgJOBS bill. I have seen the Senator from Idaho on the floor. The Senator from Idaho, the Senator from Massachusetts, and myself have all played a role in the AgJOBS bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I understand what the Senator from Georgia was trying to do, it was to substantially change the H-2A program, which is the temporary agricultural worker program. That is a visa program, codified under section 218 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Under current law, employers of H-2A guest workers must pay the State minimum wage, the Federal minimum wage, the State's adverse effect wage rate--which is the market rate or the local prevailing wage, whichever is highest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chambliss amendment would have required that H-2A employers pay the greater of either the Federal minimum wage or a newly defined prevailing wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My staff called both departments mentioned on line 6 at page 2 of his amendment--that is the Occupational Employment Statistics Program and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--neither of which had a prevailing rate they could certify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, if promulgated, would have presented serious problems for our agricultural workers. For example, in my home State, the adverse effect wage rate is $9. This rate is higher than the Federal minimum wage. Because we do not know what the prevailing wage would mean in the Chambliss amendment, it would most likely result in a major cut of wages for agricultural workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in AgJOBS, we have negotiated a 3 year freeze of the adverse wage rate so that a study could take place. It would give us a period of time to work this issue out. I think to do this as an amendment, without negotiation, without a real hearing, is a tremendous mistake. So I am very pleased the Senator chose to withdraw his amendment. I would have spoken as strongly as I possibly could against it had he not withdrawn it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Idaho.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, let me join with my colleagues on this issue in thanking the Senator from Georgia for withdrawing the amendment. It is possible to say that the concept of adverse wage is an anomaly unto itself, specific to the H-2A program. That is not to suggest it is right. It is to suggest that it was there and it ratcheted up on an automatic basis to establish the wage base for H-2A workers in the guest worker program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from California is right. As we began to negotiate and create what is now known as AgJOBS, which she and I reintroduced earlier this year, in that was a back-off from the adverse wage and a holding of the line for a period of time to level out. What the Senator from Georgia is attempting to do is establish a new wage rate. I think the Senator from California is right; we are not sure where it would go or what it would mean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to stand here and say that is not to suggest a new wage rate is not the right way to go, to establish equity between H-2A and non-H-2A workers who are doing the same job in the field, or somewhere else in agriculture. But there ought to be a consistency. If we are going to bring large groups of guest workers in--and we will, we always have; there are certain types of work only they will do--then I think we have to be sensitive to the uniqueness of that situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at the same time, it is important that we are sensitive to all of the other requirements we put upon the employer as a part of the total employment package. Is it housing? Certain other conditions along with the wage that they necessarily would not have to pay to a domestic worker who was doing comparable wage but was outside the H-2A program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a disparity today. That is why we backed it off in the negotiations. H-2A workers, by their definition, were becoming noncompetitive. Of course, in the environment in which we were working, they were becoming noncompetitive to the illegal who was in the market. So you have disparity across the board. I don't dispute what the Senator from Georgia is attempting to do. I visited with some labor attorneys who found it very problematic. If you are going to do this, we ought to work collectively,  review it appropriately, apply it against a variety of workforces to see that it is uniform and just for all employees and employers who may, because of their uniqueness, provide certain conditions for the worker that otherwise would not be necessary to provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I used to be in agriculture. We paid a certain wage. We provided a house and we provided fuel for the rig. We also provided certain grocery and food supplies. That was all viewed as a factor of employment with the employee. There are a variety of things we have to get correct. The Senator from California said it would have muddied the water a great deal. I think it would have frustrated it. I think it would have taken out part of the force that it is valuable that we keep together as we try to  reform the H-2A program, deal with the problem we currently have to secure and stabilize a legal, transparent workforce for American agriculture, treat foreign nationals right who come here legally for the purpose of that kind of employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know that this would have accomplished it. Withdrawing it, coming together with us, trying to resolve this problem I think offers us an opportunity to get our work done on this portion of immigration reform this year. I hope and I know the Senator from California agrees with me. I hope we can accomplish that by the end of the year.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I may, Madam President, I would make a statement and then ask the Senator from Idaho a question. This morning I was visited by a delegation from Tulare County, which is an agricultural county in the central valley of California. These were city and county officials who pointed out the enormous loss from the frost and the fact that it looks as though the citrus loss is going to be at least $800 million and the total loss will be over $1 billion. Nobody knows the tree loss yet,  let alone the avocado or nursery plant loss or the row crop loss of strawberries and lettuce and other crops. But this will also have an impact on  the ability to find agricultural labor, and I think the Senator agrees, I know I agree, that we must pass the AgJOBS bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, an estimated 90 percent of agricultural labor in this country--the picker part of it, not necessarily the processing and canning part of it, but the picking part, the field work--an estimated 90 percent is by undocumented people. What we have tried to do is develop a plan, which actually passed the Senate once before as part of the comprehensive immigration bill, called AgJOBS. This also reformed the H-2A program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been trying to get that bill up before this body for a vote. This next year is going to be a singularly difficult year for agriculture, and with the inability to get a consistent workforce, farmers don't know if they can plant, they don't know if they can prune, they don't know if they can pick, because they don't know if they will have enough labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question to the Senator from Idaho through the Chair is, Do you agree with the statement I made?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>I agree totally and I agree for all the reasons the Senator from California put forward--and a couple more. One of the things the Congress is committed to--both the Senators on the floor at this moment have voted for it--is to secure our Southwest border. We are investing heavily on that at this moment, and we should be. There is no question about that. We may argue about how many miles of fence, but we all recognize an unsecured border is a very problematic thing. It is closing. It  is becoming secure and we are going to continue to invest in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we are doing that, all of these other problems are beginning to happen because that workforce is moving around and they are not staying with agriculture. The Senator lost a tremendous amount this year in the San Joaquin, in the greater agricultural area of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke with young farmers and ranchers of the Idaho Farm Bureau this weekend. We have lost hundreds of millions--nowhere near what the Senator from California has lost, but we have a different kind of agriculture. The intensity of ours, the hand labor of ours is simply not as great as the Senator's. But there is a real problem and that problem is quite simple. If we don't get this corrected, we may well be looking at $5 billion worth of agricultural loss this year, and half of that or more will  come from California alone, let alone all the other areas, and I may even be conservative in my guesstimate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Senator is absolutely right. Now we are coupled with the natural weather disasters that have hit California and could hit my State at some time in the future. That is typical of agriculture. But, if we provide a stable and secure workforce that is legal, then we have helped our agriculture a great deal in knowing that when they do produce a crop, they have the people there to help them get it out of the field, get it to the processor and ultimately to the retail shelves of America.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. My plea, and I know the Senator joins with me, is that the people of America will weigh in and say: Get this bill passed; that agricultural labor will weigh in, corn and citrus, potatoes, apples, wherever it is in the United States, wherever they need a consistent, legal workforce, will please weigh in and say to this body: Get that bill up and get it passed, and will say to the other body: Get that bill up and get it passed. Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish to say to the Senator from Idaho and to the Senator from Massachusetts, I thank them so much for their work on this issue. I wish that the Senator from Georgia would be with us on AgJOBS, because I believe it is the right way to go, and I believe his State--Georgia--will also be benefited by the H-2A reforms in the bill. For California, the H-2A reforms mean that this program, which hasn't been used by agriculture because it was so cumbersome, will now be used by agriculture. It, in  effect, is the guest worker program. So passing AgJOBS secures a legal guest worker program for agriculture and also a path to legalization for those who have engaged in agricultural labor who will pay a fine, who will pay their taxes, who will commit to work in agricultural labor for another 3 years, thereby providing that consistent workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I very much hope that the day will not be far distant when the Senator from Idaho and I will be on the floor and will, hopefully, be able to mount a substantial vote for this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I come to the floor today to support a long overdue raise for America's lowest paid workers from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, more than 6 million hourly workers currently earn less than $7.25 an hour. They work hard, they pay taxes, they try to raise strong families. For a few them, it is a first job, they are young, and they do not have to support anyone else. But 80 percent of them are adults, and about half of them are their household's primary breadwinner. Forty-seven percent of them are poor, and many have to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Work should keep Americans out of poverty. It should make it possible for you to live with dignity and respect, to have a comfortable place to live in a safe neighborhood, to see a doctor, to have a shot at education, to save a little money, to enjoy the opportunities of this great country. But that's out of reach for most people at $5.15 and hour. It is time that we do better by those in our workforce who make the least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal minimum wage is at its lowest inflation-adjusted level since 1955, and it has been stagnant for almost a decade. That does not reflect well on our country and Americans are overwhelmingly supportive of an increase. In fact 29 States and countless cities have taken action and set higher minimums of their own. It is time for the Federal Government to do the same. And I know we can achieve that in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a vigorous debate about the impact of the minimum wage on employment levels and on small businesses. And I agree that all policy decisions must be made with full consideration of possible unintended consequences. But the evidence clearly indicates that raising the minimum wage is good for workers and that the effects on small businesses are negligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the most recent increase in the Federal minimum wage in 1997, the low-wage labor market actually performed better than it had in decades, with lower unemployment rates, higher average hourly wages, higher family income and lower rates of poverty. And most studies of State minimum wage increases have found no measurable negative impact on employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A group of 650 economists, including several Nobel laureates, recently issued a statement, saying: "We believe that a modest increase in the minimum wage would improve the well-being of low-wage workers and would not have the adverse effects that critics have claimed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They further note:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While controversy about the precise employment effects of the minimum wage continues, research has shown that most of the beneficiaries are adults, most are female, and the vast majority are members of low-income working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But raising the minimum wage is not just good economics, it is also a statement of our commitment to each other as Americans. I am convinced that most Americans agree that the person who serves your food or handles your checkout at the grocery store deserves to be paid a decent wage. Most people agree that parents working full time--no matter what their job or occupation--should not have to raise their children in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I think that most Americans worry, as I do, that even $7.25 an hour  is not enough in many parts of the country where a living wage that would cover housing, schooling and healthcare needs might have to be twice as high or more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the increase to $7.25 would restore the value of the minimum wage that inflation has eroded since the last increase nearly a decade ago. It would mean an additional $4,200 in annual earnings for a full-time, minimum wage worker. It would trigger additional increases in the earned-income tax credit for low-income parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, a family of four with one minimum-wage earner lives in poverty. With the increase in the minimum wage, that family would be lifted 5 percent above the poverty line instead of being 11 percent below the poverty line in 2009, as it would be under current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minimum wage cannot be the end of our commitment to help working families. But it is an important place to start.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I voted in opposition to the Gregg amendment, No. 101, which he said would establish a legislative line-item veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Gregg amendment is not a line-item veto at all. It is an enhanced rescission proposal that would give the President unprecedented powers to wait for up to 1 full year before unilaterally deciding to rescind areas of spending that Congress has previously determined are in the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not what I call a line-item veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A line-item veto would give the President short term authority when he is signing legislation to extract certain portions of that legislation. But to suggest the President should have the power to decide, up to 1 year after the appropriations process has been completed, that he wishes to withhold certain areas of expenditures is one of the most unusual transfers of power from the legislative branch to the President that I have ever seen proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The power of the purse belongs to the legislative branch, and I am willing to work with the legislative branch and the White House to try to find a way to reduce inappropriate Federal spending. But I am not willing to give the President the authority that would allow him to use a fast track process or enhanced recission authority to undermine Social Security or take any number of other actions that would give a President virtually unlimited powers of the purse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not the way the Constitution intended the separation of powers to work and I could not support the overreaching amendment offered by Senator Gregg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:10 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to consider en bloc Executive Calendar nominations 6 and 7; that there be 10 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators LEAHY and SPECTER or their designees; and that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote on the nomination of Lisa Godbey Wood to be United States District Judge, to be followed immediately by a vote on the nomination  of Philip S. Gutierrez to be a United States District Judge; that motions to reconsider be laid on the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative business; that all time consumed in executive session count postcloture; and that there be 2 minutes between each vote.</paragraph>
