    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this time to recognize and congratulate Ms. Victoria Williams of  Menasha, WI, for being selected as Goodwill Industries International 2007 Achiever of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Williams has earned this award for the bravery and spirit she displays through good times and bad. Throughout her life, Ms. Williams has overcome adversity and serious obstacles to become a proud mother and advocate for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through family tragedies and personal struggles, Ms. Williams never gave up. Instead, she dedicated herself to work on behalf of others in her community. As a job coach for people with disabilities, Ms. Williams is doing her "dream job," and helping those with whom she works achieve their own dreams. In her new role as assistant store team leader she will continue to motivate others and do great things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As her employer's name suggests, Ms. Williams exemplifies and delivers good will. She tirelessly works to improve the lives of those around her. She is able to turn what life has presented to her, both good and bad, into valuable lessons for others. She is an inspiration to her sons, her colleagues, and to all of us. As the Goodwill Industries International Achiever of the Year, she embodies the Goodwill promise of enriching individual lives and the greater community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our State and Nation, I join Goodwill Industries in recognizing and commending Ms. Williams, an extraordinary woman, for sharing her gifts with others.</paragraph>
