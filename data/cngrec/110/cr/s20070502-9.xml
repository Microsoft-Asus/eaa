    <paragraph>Mr. President, all of us in the Senate share the same goal of making sure the Food and Drug Administration stays as the gold standard for drug safety and effectiveness, and the legislation that is before the Senate today moves us toward that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout our country, researchers, scientists, and doctors are making 21st century medical advances, and the legislation we are looking at will ensure we have a 21st century FDA. It provides the resources, the authority, and the oversight to ensure that safe drugs move from the lab to our medicine cabinets without delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like other Members of the Senate, I worked on the FDA reforms back in the 1990s. Those reforms responded to the challenges we faced then. The bill before us now responds to the challenges we face today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, we have seen a lot of problems at the FDA with drug approval and postmarket surveillance. The bill we have addresses those challenges and ensures the FDA has the resources and the tools to promptly and thoroughly review new drugs and medical devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill reauthorizes and improves two pieces of legislation that will be critical in providing a timely review process. It creates a new system to actively monitor drugs after they have been approved by the FDA. It strengthens science at the FDA and, importantly, improves transparency. It improves oversight and information about clinical trials, and it works to prevent potential conflicts of interest among advisory committee members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many Americans, I was shocked at the recent revelations concerning drugs that posed risks to public safety but remained on the market for far too long. This legislation moves to address those concerns by instituting strong, new protections, including postmarket studies that will be made available to the public. I believe this new transparency and vigorous oversight is the right path toward restoring public confidence in the FDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill takes critical steps also to improve medical care for our children. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act that is included in this bill uses incentives and regulations to put America's children first. It builds upon the legislation we enacted back in 1997 that ensures pediatric medicine is a priority and that information on pediatric drugs is readily available. It extends and improves a program that has undertaken nearly 800 studies and has helped to provide pediatric labeling information  for 119 drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pediatric Research Improvement Act included in this bill is another critical component of improving pediatric care. It provides needed safety measures through mandatory clinical trials. It will help to continue pediatric oversight programs that have required trials for more than 1,000 pediatric drugs since 1998. All too often, doctors are not given guidance on the proper dose of prescription drugs for children. This bill is going to eliminate that guesswork so our children get the right doses  for safer, more effective treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides help to our Nation's children through the Pediatric Medical Devices Safety and Improvement Act. Every year, we see these wondrous technological improvements in medical devices. However, sometimes those improvements do not account for the needs of the children and the pediatricians who treat them. What that means is essential, often lifesaving devices do not meet the size or the scope or the needs of sick children. This bill will push manufacturers to develop and produce  devices that are safe and effective for children and infants. Through incentives and investor outreach, this bill will ensure that exciting advances in lifesaving devices are not just limited to adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also delivers greater safety while providing better access. I believe it will improve the way  we deliver safe innovative health care in America, and it is really my hope it will also begin to restore confidence in the institutions that safeguard our public health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public deserves nothing less than the gold standard of care from our FDA. When a nervous parent or worried senior visits their corner pharmacy, they deserve to know the product they buy on that shelf has been approved by a thorough and complete process. When a patient begins to take a new drug, they deserve a system that has actively tracked that drug and provides the patient with information on any risks they might face. Everyone--drug companies, researchers, patients, and doctors  alike--deserves a system that supports an efficient and timely FDA approval process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am very eager to move this legislation forward and get it to a vote so we can begin to deliver what the American people deserve. I hope this Senate moves quickly on this bill and we are able to move it along in the process very shortly in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
