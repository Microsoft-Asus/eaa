    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize April 28, 2008, as the first annual "Denim Day" in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, Denim Day is observed in communities across the country to raise awareness and educate the public about rape and sexual assault. The observance was created in response to an appalling 1998 decision of the Italian Supreme Court. In that decision, the court overturned a rape conviction because the victim was wearing tight jeans at the time of the attack and must have helped her rapist remove them. Women and men around the world were rightly outraged by the verdict, and wearing jeans  on Denim Day has become an international symbol of protest, calling attention to the horrible crime of rape and the destructive attitudes that prevent sexual assault victims from receiving justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is sexually assaulted. Despite its prevalence, sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes in the world, meaning many attackers never spend a day in prison for their offenses. Denim Day in New Jersey will send a strong and powerful message that sexual assault is always wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this observance will encourage more sexual assault victims to come forward and hold their attacker accountable, as well as provide some comfort to the victims of sexual assault, who will know that they are not alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I would like to recognize April 28, 2008, as "Denim Day" in New Jersey and reiterate my strong support for observing this important day.</paragraph>
