  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work and dedication of a great leader and great educator from northern Kentucky, Dr. Fred Bassett. Since 1996, Dr. Bassett has served as superintendent of the Beechwood School District in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working as a parole and probation officer early in his career, Fred wondered how he could make a difference in the lives of young people before they got off track. He decided that the answer was in education, and he dedicated his life and his future to investing in children and future generations of this community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rising through the ranks in the Beechwood School District, Fred served as a teacher, assistant principal and principal before being named to his current position of superintendent. His success is the fruit of his character, his commitment and his vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred helped make Beechwood School District an institution known statewide as a leader in academics and as a perennial powerhouse in high school football. I am proud of the success he has had in helping our students excel both in and out of the classroom. I thank him for his service and wish him the best of his luck in his new career at the University of Cincinnati.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred Bassett's leadership has planted the seeds of success in thousands of children which will bear fruit for our community, our commonwealth and our country in the decades ahead.</paragraph>
