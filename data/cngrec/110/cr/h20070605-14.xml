    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a subject that is first on the minds and the wallets of the American public, and that is the cost of rising energy prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in the middle of the summer, and prices at the pump are above $3 a gallon in much of America. The liberal leadership was going to fix the high gas prices, and they have responded by offering no solutions. They offered so-called "price gouging" legislation, but it did nothing to address the root problem of high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public wants innovation, not procrastination. They want energy exploration, not bureaucratic red tape. They want this Congress to do their jobs and put forth a plan that will power this country, self sufficiently, into this century and beyond. The liberal leadership, meanwhile, is missing in action on the issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America needs to change the way we look at how we produce energy, and in the next couple of weeks the Republican Conference will take the lead in unfurling a long-term energy plan for the future. It will not only address our immediate power concerns but those for decades to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
