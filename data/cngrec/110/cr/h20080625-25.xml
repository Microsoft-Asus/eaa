    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in middle Tennessee today, you are going to pay about $3.93 for a gallon of gas. My constituent families know that this price is outrageous, and they know that now they are being faced with choices: How much are they going to put in the tank or how much are they going to put in that grocery cart when they go to the grocery store? This is unacceptable, and my constituents know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also know that there are some things that we could and should be doing. May I offer a suggestion to that, Mr. Speaker. Here is a simple way to start:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the Democrat leadership, admit you made a mistake, and repeal the so-called Energy Independence and Security Act that you passed last December that didn't produce one bit of oil or gas or move anything to the marketplace. It put in place roadblocks, and we have far too many roadblocks to putting gas into the pumps and into our cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, let's repeal section 526 of this so-called Energy Policy Act, and let's get rid of a roadblock that makes it more difficult for the U.S. Government to address the needs that we have and, certainly, for our Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many things that we could and should be doing before we leave for July 4. There are things that we could and should be doing to make certain that our constituents have a safer July 4th celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's reduce the price at the pump.</paragraph>
