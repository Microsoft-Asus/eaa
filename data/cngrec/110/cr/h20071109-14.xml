    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday, America will pay tribute to tens of thousands of military veteran men and women who have bravely served their country and who have fought to protect our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention one resident from Pickens, South Carolina, Mr. Tommy Wires, who served this country for 9 years in the United States Marine Corps. Tommy joined the Marine Corps in 1959. He served two tours in Vietnam and, while serving with the 26th Marines on his second tour in Vietnam, was wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his service, he remained devoted to his wife and his two sons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tommy is a part of those brave soldiers on this coming Veterans Day who deserve recognition for his sacrifice and love for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is an American patriot, and while he served as a soldier for America, he demonstrated to his friends, his family and his country the true colors of red, white and blue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tommy, thank you for your service. We love you. God bless.</paragraph>
