    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I mourn the loss of Hanley Denning, a truly remarkable native of Maine who in word and deed represented the very best of our State and Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hanley was the visionary founder and executive director of Safe Passage, a Central American-based nonprofit agency which provides children who live in the Guatemala City garbage dump opportunity and hope through myriad forms, including education, nutrition, and health care. Hanley founded Safe Passage in 1999 after having seen children existing amid the squalor and destitution of refuse and trash. But where many would have seen a dead-end marked by desolation, Hanley saw a need which soon after  evolved into a calling that required conscience and action. She imagined a pathway out--and possessed the will, determination, and resolve to forge a plan to begin making that route a reality. Hanley took a dilapidated church near the waste dump and developed a drop-in center where children could receive food and a safe haven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hanley found that access to education of any kind was not a possibility for children who couldn't begin to afford the enrollment fees, school supplies, and books required by the Guatemalan public schools--not to mention requisite school uniforms and shoes. But thanks to Safe Passage, children have been able to attend a local public school for at least a half-day term. And that experience is complemented by the additional educational reinforcement, care, and supervision received at the center.  Whether it is homework, hands-on learning activities, nutrition, medical attention, or a range of other programs, these at-risk youth are recipients of the care they deserve. Today, remarkably, Safe Passage serves as many as 600 children ages 2 to 19 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw once famously wrote that "You see things; and you say, `Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, `Why not?' " When Hanley saw despair, poverty, and indescribable hopelessness, she must have at first said, "Why?" But she responded to an unforgivable, intolerable situation--not with indifference, resignation, or anger--but by saying, "Why not?" Why not carve out a way forward for these children that leads from an abject condition to  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="1408">S1408</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hanley's response to the deplorable situation she found at the Guatemalan dump is emblematic of her overall approach to so much of her life--one filled with a selfless care for others and a willful devotion to being an agent of good will and positive change. Although she hadn't created Safe Passage until 1999, Hanley had been offering a kind of safe passage for so many during years prior to her arrival in Guatemala. Along with earning a master's degree along the way, Hanley was also working at  a mental health center, assisting children affected by AIDS, and teaching in a Head Start program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this shining example of service, it is little wonder Bowdoin College, her alma mater, recognized Hanley's extraordinary contributions by honoring her with its 2002 Common Good Award. What was so exceptional about Hanley was her longstanding dedication and unfailing determination to address and improve the human condition. She truly exemplified words spoken in 1902 by Joseph McKeen, first president of Bowdoin:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... institutions are founded and endowed for the common good and not for the private advantage of those who resort to them for education. It is not that they may be able to pass through life in an easy and reputable manner, but that their mental powers may be cultivated and improved for the benefit of society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hanley's greatest legacy and enduring cause will be memorialized in her name and with her spirit--in a thriving center given to helping those who truly cannot help themselves; a center where, according to a Portland Press Herald account, just last year six Safe Passage students were selected to enroll in Guatemala City's foremost private high schools, where the annual budget has grown from funds in the hundreds to $1.6 million and an employee base of 100, and where more than 500 people from Greater  Portland are counted among an emerging force for good of Safe Passage volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers go out to Hanley's parents, Michael and Marina Denning, and her three brothers, Jordan, Seth, and Lucas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President, for affording me the opportunity to speak about this truly exceptional Mainer and American whose memory will be a lasting inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
