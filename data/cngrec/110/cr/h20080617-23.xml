  <narrative>EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT AWARD -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5417]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the GAO will rule on the Boeing protest of the Air Force acquisition process for the $35 billion award to replace the KC-135 air refueling tankers that went to Northrop and a European consortium team in February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Labor's employment report for May showed a loss of 49,000 jobs and an unemployment rate that increased to 5.5 percent--the biggest monthly rise since 1986. Yet this contract will not only continue but accelerate the erosion of our industrial base and skilled workforce. According to an Economic Policy Institute analysis released earlier this month, this decision will ground at least 14,000 U.S. jobs. Roughly half the parts and labor that go into making Airbus tankers will come  from overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Producing the Airbus KC-45 tanker would support about 14,350 U.S. jobs per year, while Boeing's proposed tanker would support at least twice as many jobs--including those for high-skilled workers manufacturing engines in Middletown, Connecticut. Our economy has lost nearly 325,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. We should not be sending more jobs overseas, outsourcing our technological base. We should be creating jobs at home, supporting local innovation, and investing in our economy.</paragraph>
