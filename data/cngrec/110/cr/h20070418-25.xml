    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President is going to talk to the congressional leaders about Iraq. It is his way of trying to defuse the will of the American people. He is going to talk about his vision for a military victory in Iraq. He is going to talk about his military escalation and how well it is working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is not going to talk about the bombing in the Green Zone last week, or the fact that about 3 hours ago there were 127 Iraqis killed by a suicide bomber. And it is only early morning. There is plenty of time left in this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President will say there are good days and there are bad days. In truth, there are only bad days, and worse days in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only thing worth talking about is protecting our soldiers by getting them out of the Iraq quagmire. That is the only discussion worth having, because setting a timetable is the only way to protect and defend the U.S. soldiers he keeps sending into harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don't give him an inch, Mr. Speaker. Bring our troops home.</paragraph>
