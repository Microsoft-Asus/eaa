  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week was an extraordinary week of success for America in promoting nuclear nonproliferation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday, the North Koreans destroyed the cooling tower at their Yongbyon nuclear complex. This, plus other recent concessions by that regime, will lead to additional aid for the people of that impoverished nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In India, the U.S.-India civilian nuclear agreement appears to be closer to approval. This is an important step to bring clean nuclear energy to the citizens of fast-growing India.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Iraq, there was the removal of the last remnants of Saddam Hussein's nuclear program when 550 metric tons of yellowcake, the seed material for higher-grade nuclear enrichment, was shipped to Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the threat of Iran continues to grow. The Iranian Government has confirmed it will not comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions requiring it to stop enriching uranium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is encouraging to see the people of North Korea, India and Iraq benefit from moral cooperation, but it is sad to see the misguided government of Iran further isolate its civilian population and put them at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
