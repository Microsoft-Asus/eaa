    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life of Michael Proctor Smith, who passed away at his home in New Orleans on Friday, September 26, 2008. He was 71. Michael, a native of New Orleans, was an award-winning professional freelance photographer who chronicled the music, culture, and folklife of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana for over 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael was well known for documenting New Orleans social club parades and jazz funerals, neighborhood traditions, Mardi Gras Indians, spiritual church ceremonies, and many of the city and State's renowned jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel musicians. He was a fixture at every New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival since it began in 1970 until his retirement in 2005. His works are internationally recognized and are permanent collections at a number of museums including the Bibliothque National  in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Historic New Orleans Collection, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and the Louisiana State Museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last few years, Michael had been honored with numerous awards celebrating his work. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities in 2002 and was named Music Photographer of the Year by Offbeat magazine. In 2004 he received a Mayor's Arts Award from the Arts Council of New Orleans and a Clarence John Laughlin Lifetime Achievement Award from the New Orleans/Gulf South chapter of the American Society of Media Photographers. In 2005, he received  the Delgado Society award from the New Orleans Museum of Art, the first photographer to be so honored. The recipient of two Photographer's Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Michael's prints have toured worldwide through the U.S. Information Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael's photographs grace the covers of many CDs and record albums, illustrate numerous books and magazine articles published in America and Europe, and are a staple of documentary films on the rich cultural history of New Orleans and Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also an original owner and founder of Tipitina's, an iconic music club located at the corner of Napoleon Avenue and Tchoupitoulas Street in uptown New Orleans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael is survived by his partner Karen Louise Snyder; his brother Joseph Byrd Hatchitt Smith; two daughters, Jan Lamberton Smith and Leslie Blackshear Smith; and three grandchildren, Chance King Doyle, Leslie  Elizabeth Doyle, and Francis Brandon Arant.</paragraph>
