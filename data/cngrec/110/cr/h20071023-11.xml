    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our Nation's values are reflected in how we spend taxpayers' hard-earned money. Yesterday, rather than encouraging us to invest in the good health of our children here at home, the President asked for permission to spend $200 billion in Iraq. Well, it is okay to ask and it is okay to respond by saying, "No, thank you." The health of our Nation's children is more valuable than making more of a mess in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, enough is enough. It is time to spend our tax dollars right here at home. Last week, 44 Republicans joined the Democratic majority in attempting to override the President's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP. This issue is not going away. We will prevail. It is a matter of how long it will take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are some facts to keep in mind: SCHIP saves tax dollars by sending children in need to the doctor's office, not to the costly emergency room. And over 90 percent of those in SCHIP earn less than $41,000 a year. There is a better way of doing things in America. By working together, we will find it and guarantee access to health care for all those in need.</paragraph>
