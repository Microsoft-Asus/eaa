    <paragraph>Madam President, last month, at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, Rhonda Stewart, a single mother from Hamilton, OH, Butler  County, testified that despite working full time, caring for her 9-year-old son Wyatt--even serving as president of the PTA--she and her son must rely on food stamps to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of each month, she told us, she must forgo dinner so her son can eat because the food stamps, which is about $6 a day, don't go far enough. She told us that at the beginning of the month, he gets pork chops. He knows he eats better in the beginning of the month than at the end of the month when she is running out of money. At the end of the month, she sits and tells him she is not really hungry, as her son eats, because she wants him to have enough, even when she doesn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the same day that Ms. Steward testified, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee that the economy was doing well. He said over and over that the GDP was up 3 percent for the quarter. He kept insisting: Senator, you don't understand, things are going very well in this country. GDP is up 3 percent. People are making money and companies are profitable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you think about all of that, here is the story: Profits are up. The stock market is doing well. Millionaires are enjoying exorbitant tax breaks. Worker productivity is up, but the workers are not sharing in the increasing profits most corporations are making. Workers across the country too often are losing their jobs, and a single mother working full time cannot afford to eat dinner--even with the $6 a day in food stamps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Wall Street Journal article reported this week that since 2001, the economy has grown by 16 percent--16 percent since 2001--while worker pay, after inflation, has grown less than 1 percent--16 percent growth in the economy, profits up, workers gaining less than 1 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wrongheaded economic policies and job-killing trade agreements have fueled income disparity at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago, after the North American Free Trade Agreement passed, Congress was considering another one of these job-killing trade agreements. I traveled to McAllen, TX, where I crossed the border into Reynosa, Mexico. I rented a car with some friends and went to visit some families in Mexico just a couple of miles on the other side of the American border. There I met a husband and wife who worked for General Electric, Mexico. They lived in a shack that was about 20-by-20 feet, with no running  water, no electricity, dirt floors. When it rained hard, the floors turned to mud. They worked 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, and each made less than a dollar an hour. Behind their shack was a ditch that was about 3 feet wide, perhaps, which was full of who-knows-what--perhaps human and industrial waste. The children played in this ditch. The American Medical Association has said that along that border is one of the most toxic places in the entire Western Hemisphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We visited an auto plant nearby, a modern, high-tech auto plant. The plant in Mexico looked just like an auto plant in Lordstown, OH, or Avon Lake or Cincinnati. The workers were working hard, the floors were clean, the technology was up-to-date, and the productivity was very good. But there was one difference between the Mexican auto plant and the one you would see in Ohio. That difference was the Mexican auto plant didn't have a parking lot. The Mexican workers were not making enough to buy  the cars they made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can go halfway around the world to Malaysia to a Motorola plant, where the workers are not making enough to buy the cell phones they make, or you can go to Costa Rica, where workers at a Disney plant don't make enough to buy the toys they make. In China, workers at a Nike plant are not making enough to buy those shoes they make. These workers are not sharing in the wealth they create for their employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why these job-killing trade agreements don't work. Only when workers share in the wealth they create will we know our trade policy is working. In fact, when the poor in the developing world--those people who are working hard, working 50 to 60 hours a week, with their hands--only when the poor in those countries are able to buy the products they are making for us will we know our trade policy in the United States is actually working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the fight against the Central American Free Trade Agreement 2 years ago, the largest ever bipartisan fair-trade group was formed. Democrats and Republicans, environmental groups, religious groups, labor organizations, and business groups united and we changed forever the debate on trade. That coalition is alive and well, not just in the House of Representatives but also for the first time in the Senate. They are already working to revamp our Nation's trade policy and working to establish  a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>manufacturing policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators BYRON DORGAN, LINDSEY GRAHAM, and I have introduced legislation that would ban imports from sweatshops. We have called for tougher World Trade Organization action to be taken against China, a country where, at least in 2005, 5,000 political prisoners were executed. The human rights violations continue in China. The oppression of workers continues in China. The kinds of values we hold dear in this country are violated every day by that Government and every day by these companies  doing business in China, a country that manipulates its currency and continues to exploit its workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Government must renegotiate these trade agreements so that they lift up workers here and abroad, reward U.S. businesses that stay here, reward U.S. businesses that produce here, and reward U.S. businesses that create jobs here. That means doing away with current fast-track authority. That means doing away with the fundamentally flawed North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA model trade agreements. Make no mistake, we want trade. We want more of it, but we want fair trade. It is not a matter  of if we revamp U.S. trade policy; it is when and who benefits from that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is a nation of innovation. The future of our manufacturing policy is firmly planted in the research and development of alternative energy. Today, I spoke with several people from Ohio--business owners and plant managers--who are part of a group called the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. It is a relatively small government program that helps small manufacturers, small businesses in Ohio and across the country, learn to compete better, helps them learn to cut their health care costs,  helps them to be more energy efficient, and helps them learn how to export some of their products. We have a long way to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oberlin College, not far from where I live, is home to the largest building in the United States on a college campus that is completely powered by solar energy. However, when that college built this building, they had to buy the components of the solar panels from Japan and Germany because we don't make enough of them in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same is true when you talk about wind turbines. In Ashtabula, OH, they make components for wind-turbine manufacturing. So do some other places around the country. But they do not make enough. More and more wind turbines are being built in this country, and it is a great opportunity, as all of alternative energy production is, for us as a nation to use that, in part, to help rebuild our manufacturing capabilities, to cut energy prices, and to do the right thing for the environment. It works  in every way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why as we, in the next couple of months, move toward votes on trade promotion authority, as we move forward, perhaps, on votes on bilateral trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Korea, Panama, and other countries, perhaps, it is time that we pass trade agreements in this country that lift up workers, help our small manufacturers, that help us continue to preserve and expand our manufacturing base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an American value to reward hard work. This Congress has a real opportunity not just to talk about a different trade regimen but to go in a different direction, to replace trade promotion authority with a trade promotion authority legislation model that will help to lift our workers up, create jobs in this country, help the developing world lift up their living standards so that we can continue to reward work and continue to fight for our values as a nation.</paragraph>
