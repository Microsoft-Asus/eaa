  <narrative>SENATE BUSINESS -- (Senate - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11129">S11129</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me add that I share the goal of the majority leader. There is no reason why the Senate cannot finish not only the bill we will wrap up before noon but also the Foreign Operations-State appropriations bill and the education reconciliation. I will mention that during the years when Senator Leahy and I handled the Foreign Operations bill--and Senator Leahy is now the chairman and Senator Gregg is the ranking member--our record,  I say to my friend, the majority leader, one year we got it done in one afternoon. I don't know if that is possible this year, but it certainly has happened before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will be cooperating to the maximum extent possible to help achieve both these goals before the end of the week.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill we are going to take up also is an interesting bill in that it is $700 million less than the President requested, and that is unusual, especially in a Foreign Operations bill. We hope we can work through that legislation. Senator Gregg is certainly experienced, as is Senator Leahy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On our side, the time for morning business is going to be allocated as follows: 10 minutes each to Senator Nelson, Senator Salazar, and Senator Sanders, the 30 minutes we have that will be beginning soon.</paragraph>
