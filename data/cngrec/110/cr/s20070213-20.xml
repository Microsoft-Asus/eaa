    <paragraph>Mr. President, each Congress I rise to honor February as Black History Month. Each February since 1926, our Nation has recognized the contributions of Black Americans to the history of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is no accident; February is a significant month in Black American history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham Lincoln, and scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in the month of February. The 15th amendment to the Constitution was ratified 136 years ago this month, preventing race discrimination in the right to vote. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in February in New York City. And on February 25, 1870, this body  welcomed its first Black Senator, Hiram R. Revels of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this important month I want to celebrate some of the contributions made by Black Americans in my home State of Oregon. Since Marcus Lopez, who sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, became the first person of African descent known to set foot in Oregon, a great many Black Americans have helped shape the history of my State. Throughout this month, I will come to the floor to highlight some of their stories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Jesse James "J.J." Clow was a beloved minister and a prominent figure in the struggle for civil rights in Portland, OR. In 1936, Reverend Clow began a service of ministry at Portland's Mount Olivet Baptist Church. Mount Olivet was the first African-American baptist church in the State of Oregon and during the 1940s and 1950s was also the largest Black church in the State. It was from this vantage point that Clow lived and preached a social gospel that contributed to the civil rights  battles of Portland's WWII challenges and continued through the turbulent 60s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clow was born in Hufsmith, TX, 1 of 15 children. Clow finished high school at Tuskegee Institute and received his B.A. from Virginia Union University. His first pulpit was in Virginia, a second in Georgia, before arriving in Portland. His experiences growing up in the South helped prepare him for a lifetime of activism for justice and civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the World War II years, Clow served as president of the local chapter of the NAACP. He was also deeply involved in the establishment of a Portland office of the Urban League. Along with these national organizations, Clow and other Portland area Black leaders worked tirelessly to improve housing and employment opportunities for African Americans. These efforts were largely responsible for ridding the city of many traditional economic and social segregation policies, including Oregon's first  civil rights ordinance in 1953.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his retirement from Mount Olivet in 1963, Reverend Clow spoke warmly of the progress he had witnessed during his lifetime. He continued to believe that Christianity must be interpreted in terms of how men behave towards one another and not just to comfort them. Until his death, Clow encouraged the community of Portland to more fully embrace democratic ideals in its social, political, and economic sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Clow is only one example of the Black men and women who changed the course of history in Oregon and in the United States. During the remainder of Black History Month, I will return to the floor to celebrate more Oregonians like Rev. J.J. Clow, whose contributions, while great, have not yet received the attention they deserve.</paragraph>
