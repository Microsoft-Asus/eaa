  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, almost 6 months into the new Congress with a new majority, the "drain the swamp" mentality is disappearing as quickly as the Democrats' approval ratings in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A new Gallup Poll has the latest congressional approval rating at 14 percent, which is the lowest it's been since the Democrats took charge and the lowest of all time. This makes sense when you consider that the Democrat leadership continues to backpedal at every opportunity on the promises they made to the American people, whether it's a failure to enact openness and transparency to increase accountability for earmark reform, their failure to enact their 100-hour agenda, or the increased infighting  that's being seen on the other side as it tries to cope with how to spin another broken promise to their constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enough is enough, and it's time to get down to the important business the American people elected us to do.</paragraph>
