  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR PRATT -- (Senate - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="443">S443</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the memory of Arthur Pratt, a friend and distinguished Hoosier who dedicated his life to helping the less fortunate among us. While I am saddened by Arthur passing, I continue to be inspired by his legacy of selfless service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among his many remarkable endeavors, Arthur will be remembered by many in the Indianapolis community for the work that he did counseling inmates as they worked to address addiction to alcohol and drugs. The program that Arthur created to facilitate these efforts, Life Effectiveness Training, has worked in the Marion County Jail for more than 35 years and has since expanded to other counties across Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 14, 2001, I joined Arthur at Christ Church Cathedral to celebrate his important leadership of the Life Effectiveness Training program. Joining Arthur were community leaders who had witnessed the success of Arthur's leadership, including members of the religious community and law enforcement and government officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my great honor to work closely with Arthur to pass the Jail Based Substance Abuse Treatment Act as part of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act in 2002. This legislation makes available additional resources to programs like Life Effectiveness Training as they work with inmates to address their substance abuse issues. Not only has this approach reduced recidivism by up to 64 percent, but it has given countless Hoosiers a new opportunity to turn away from  crime and commit themselves to becoming productive, law-abiding members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I know that this is a difficult time for Arthur's family and many friends, my thoughts are with his wife Amal and their children and grandchildren as they remember and celebrate his life of service and leadership.</paragraph>
