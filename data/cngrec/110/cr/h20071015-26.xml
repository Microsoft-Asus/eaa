  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1727">H.R. 1727</bill>, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act. I am honored to have known Christopher and Dana Reeve, and it is fitting that we are considering this bill today just after the 3-year anniversary of Christopher's death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, sometimes hardships and painful experiences are the starting point for an incredible advocacy, and this was certainly the case with Christopher and Dana Reeve. In turn, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act reflects our desire to carry out their work and improve the lives of, and hasten better treatments and cures for, people living with paralysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as many of my colleagues may be aware, millions of  Americans live with paralysis. Two million Americans live with paralysis of the extremities; a quarter million Americans live with spinal cord injuries; 4 million Americans live with the effects of stroke; 250,000 to 350,000 Americans have been diagnosed with some form of multiple sclerosis; half a million children and adults in the U.S. have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy; and 30,000  Americans, as we have just heard, live with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is multifaceted and seeks to address several aspects of paralysis research and quality-of-life issues. The bill expands research on paralysis at the NIH by encouraging collaborative research to connect scientists doing similar work and enhanced understanding and speed discovery of better treatment and cures. The bill also encourages research to enhance the daily function of people with paralysis, including improving their functional mobility, assessing the efficacy and outcomes  of medical rehabilitation therapies, and developing improved assistive technology to improve function and independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the bill seeks to improve the quality of life and health of persons with paralysis and other physical disabilities by supporting programs to disseminate information involving care and rehabilitation options. It also coordinates best practices designed to support and advance quality-of-life programs for persons living with paralysis and other physical disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Christopher and Dana Reeve used their visibility to work on behalf of families in all parts of this country who face the challenges of paralysis and impaired mobility. I have been honored to carry on their work and am honored to work on this legislation with Congresswoman Bono, Congressman Langevin, and Congressman Bilirakis. I am also thankful to have had the opportunity to work with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and the thousands of paralysis  advocates who have worked for the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today as well in support of <bill type="h" number="1727">H.R. 1727</bill>, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, introduced by Representatives Baldwin, Bono, and Bilirakis. My colleague from Wisconsin stated very eloquently the statistics and the justification for this act, and it is long overdo. As was mentioned, the legislation would authorize the Director of the National Institutes of Health to coordinate paralysis research through the NIH Institutes and Centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research would be focused on basic, translational, and multicenter networks of clinical sites focused on designing clinical rehabilitation protocols for one or more forms of paralysis. Such paralysis research would include paralysis from the central nervous system trauma, disorders, stroke, or any combination of such conditions. Additionally, the legislation would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for activities related to paralysis, including grants to establish  paralysis registries and disseminate information to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have seen over the years how the Reeves served as strong advocates for the paralysis community, meeting with a wide variety of colleagues in the House and the Senate over the last several years. Their dignified presence in Washington will be greatly missed. I believe that through legislative initiatives such as this one the work done by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation will continue that work that was left unfinished, and will be done so in a respectful manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the population continues to grow and to age, I think more and more of society will be confronted with the likes of paralysis. It is our job, and I think responsibility, to partner with the private sector to bring awareness, funding, and education to ensure that as few people as possible are brought down by this illness.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure and honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a leader in this cause and a sponsor of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1727">H.R. 1727</bill>, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act. Millions of Americans suffer from paralysis and mobility impairment. They struggle each and every day to perform even the most basic of tasks that most of us take for granted. The impact this impairment has on the lives and the lives of those who love them and care for them is staggering. As one who has struggled with hearing and vision problems nearly my entire life, I know how difficult  any physical impairment can be, both physically and emotionally; but I cannot imagine what people with severe paralysis go through and their constant struggle to maintain hope that they one day will walk or move again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, which will encourage collaborative research in paralysis and hasten the discovery of treatments and potential cures to improve the lives of people with paralysis. I am especially pleased that this bill is modeled after legislation I introduced at the beginning of this Congress. My bill, the language of which this bill includes, also has provisions to utilize VA facilities to improve paralysis research and better track the  work that is being done in this area within the world's largest system of hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin for sponsoring this bill, and also Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell and Ranking Member Joe Barton for moving it through their committee. I also want to give special thanks to my father, former Congressman Mike Bilirakis, who first introduced this bill several years ago after meeting the extraordinary men and women for whom this bill was named. His persistence and determination helped build  the necessary support to get us where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I never had the honor of meeting Christopher or Dana Reeve personally, my father has shared with me their strength, dignity, and courage in dealing with what only people similarly situated can fully understand. They pushed to the national forefront the issue of the need for better research into paralysis and greater emphasis on rehabilitation. I wish they were here to share this moment with us today, though I am sure they are both smiling down on our efforts here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I believe we can and must do more for those suffering from paralysis and mobility impairment. I urge all my colleagues to help take a significant step forward in this area by supporting this bill today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me just once again thank Mr. Bilirakis and, of course, his father for spearheading this when he was in the House, and Ms. Baldwin and Mrs. Bono for bringing this to the floor. We know how paralysis, especially sudden paralysis, can damage one's life and that of their family, and it becomes a lifelong commitment. Once again, I think Congress has a real fundamental responsibility to ensure we can bring as much peace and peace of mind to  those families. With that, I urge the adoption of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, as we remember Christopher Reeve just after the third anniversary of his passing, we honor him by having the House consider today and pass one of the truly first comprehensive bills focused on paralysis research and care for those who are paralyzed. I urge Members to strongly support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1727">H.R. 1727</bill>, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Quality of Life for Persons with Paralysis Act. And as I express my support for this legislation today, I would like to recognize an outstanding organization in my district, Linking Employment, Abilities, and Potential, or LEAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LEAP provides hope and empowerment for tens of thousands of people with disabilities and their families throughout Northeast Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through legislation such as the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, Congress sends a message about people with disabilities--that they matter, that they can and do make valuable contributions to society. That is a message that LEAP and so many disability rights advocates send every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LEAP is deeply committed to empowering people with disabilities in the workplace through specialized skill development programs, at home through independent living training, in the medical system through access to the best medical care, and in so many other aspects of society. LEAP's Disability Employment Training Program, in particular, aligns with the goals of Christopher and Dana Reeve, who fought so hard for integration and acceptance for those with disabilities in our communities. LEAP has  an 80 percent success rate in employment training and placement and has a tremendous impact on the community, recognizing the many talents of people with disabilities and the potential to be productive citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I rise to express my support for <bill type="h" number="1727">H.R. 1727</bill>, and to honor Linking Employment, Abilities, and Potential.</paragraph>
