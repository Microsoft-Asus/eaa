  <narrative>RECOGNIZING KITTY ROBERTS -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14614">S14614</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to recognize Kitty L. Roberts, the superintendent of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, who will retire on December 3, 2007, after 28 years with the National Park Service. Currently the superintendent of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National Monument, for many years Kitty headed the National Park Service's Office of Legislative and Congressional Affairs, where she worked very closely with the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Milton, WV, Kitty graduated from the University of Maryland and attended graduate school at Indiana University. She then worked for the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, where she remained for 9 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kitty began her career with the National Park Service in 1979 as a management assistant in the National Capital Region. She went on to become the assistant superintendent at the George Washington Memorial Parkway between 1980 and 1984. From 1984 to 1990, Kitty was the Deputy Associate Regional Director, White House Liaison, in the National Capital Region. During this time, Kitty was the NPS Inaugural coordinator and oversaw the development of East Executive Park that now serves as a visitor entrance  to the White House. In 1990, Kitty returned to the George Washington Memorial Parkway, where she served as superintendent. In 1993, former National Park Service Director Roger Kennedy asked Kitty to become the assistant director for Legislative and Congressional Affairs. Kitty served in that position for 8 years, and during that time was extremely helpful to the committee in its consideration of national park-related legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Kitty's tenure as assistant director, over 230 laws were passed affecting our national parks. Among the notable laws passed during that period were the California Desert Protection Act and the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, with its creation of 5 new park units, 10 new national heritage areas, 12 park boundary adjustments, and numerous other changes that benefited several units of the National Park System. Kitty also worked on the Transportation Equity Act for the  21st Century, which doubled the amount of funding for national park roads, and the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, which reformed the National Park Service's concessions program, created a park research mandate, and supported employee career development and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February 2001, Kitty left Washington to become the superintendent of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National Monument. During her time at the park, Kitty has worked on a policy for personal watercraft and off-highway vehicle use. She has found ways to maintain access to Lake Powell even as ongoing drought conditions have led to a 145-foot drop in the lake's water level. Perhaps one of her most important contributions has been a program of public education to prevent  needless deaths due to individuals swimming behind boats where exhaust fumes were vented. In early June of this year, Kitty presided with the President of the Navajo Nation at the grand opening of the new floating marina village at Antelope Point, with its architectural elements from the surrounding red rock landscape and its unique cooling system using lake water from 75 feet below the surface.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kitty has had a distinguished career with the National Park Service and will be greatly missed by those she has worked with over the years, both in the Park Service and in Congress. I want to congratulate Kitty on her retirement and thank her for the many contributions she has made toward making our national parks the pride of our Nation, and I wish her the best in the years ahead.</paragraph>
