    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in support of the 20th Annual Global Youth Service Day. This event, the largest service event in the world, celebrates the contributions of young people to better their community, country and world through voluntarism. The day also celebrates contributions by the community, including the  public, private, and nonprofit sectors, to empower young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the youth who participate in the Global Youth Service Day, I gravitated towards public service at a young age. After graduating from law school, I worked for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare on the rights and potential contributions of disabled Americans. We all have a contribution to make, and for me, the greatest joy in life has come from public service, which has enabled me to touch countless lives. My mother, Mary Hanford, who passed away just shy of 103 years old, taught  me at a very young age the importance of giving back to your community and helping those around you. She taught me that the best thing you can leave behind is not found on a r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; or in a bank account; it is found in your character, making a difference, a positive difference, the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Global Youth Service Day, millions of young people across the globe will participate in thousands of community improvement projects. Although we commemorate this event only once a year, Global Youth Service Day is a celebration of contributions made every day by dedicated young people who desire to change the world one good deed at a time, and by the communities that empower them to do so. True service is not giving 1 day or even 1 week a year; it is truly a way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The projects carried out for Global Youth Service Day focus on issues ranging from increasing literacy to protecting the environment and ending hunger. One can see the diversity of the projects and the dedication of the participants by looking at those carried out in my home state of North Carolina during last year's Global Youth Service Day. One such project, the Pfeiffer University Relay for Life, was held a few miles from my hometown of Salisbury. This 24-hour relay was held to support cancer  research and to raise awareness. Another project, in Charlotte, involved a group doing their own part to protect the environment by picking up litter and cleaning a creek in their neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back over the years, my belief is it won't be the cars you drove or the titles you held or the awards you were given that will matter. No, it is character, integrity, a caring heart and compassionate concern and love for your fellow man that will count for so much more. So let me assure you, that just one individual, one person like those who participate in this important day, can make a world of difference ..... even, I might say, a different world. Volunteers are a powerful force, and  our future depends on people like these youth, who will motivate and challenge others and make that positive difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one is ever too young or too old to be involved in shaping our world. I encourage all youth to be inspired on this day to use their talents to find ways to make a positive difference in the lives of others. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation designating April 25, 2008, as Global Youth Service Day.</paragraph>
