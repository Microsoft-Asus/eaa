    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thrust by President Nixon's resignation into an office he had never sought, former President Gerald Ford occupied the White House for just 896 days. They were, however, 896 extraordinary days that President Ford used to guide the Nation through and out of the dark days of the Watergate scandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Ford took office on August 9, 1974, he declared: "I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ford got his first exposure to national politics at Yale University, working as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's Republican campaign for President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After World War II service with the Navy in the Pacific, he went back to practicing law in Grand Rapids and became active in Republican reform politics. The rest is history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948 as a Republican. Ford's reputation for integrity and openness made him popular and well regarded among his peers during his 25 years in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, he was elected minority leader. Mr. Ford was a devoted public servant who led his country with grace and bipartisanship during challenging times. The country is grateful to him for his leadership and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great pleasure once again to recognize the many accomplishments that President Ford had during his life, and I am pleased that we can spend more time this evening adding to the record we began early this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I do that, I want to remind all Members to please take the time to go to the Cloakrooms and record their remembrances in the books that are displayed there. This will be very meaningful to Mrs. Ford and the family if we can do that, and I urge all Members to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I proceed any further, I would like to yield to Mr. McCotter from Michigan for such time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to go on record with the reminiscence of late President Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young person growing up in Michigan, I remember Watergate. It is a very early political memory. And it would have been so easy at the time for that indelible memory to remain with a young person and sour them and make them cynical toward the public process and toward government in general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I was very lucky because the man who took the place of the disgraced Richard Nixon was a man from Michigan by the name of Gerald Ford. Living in Michigan at the time being a young person, to see someone from my home State filled me with pride and a sense of inspiration that one person could rise above it and help to heal the wounds of a Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in many ways today in paying respect to Gerald Ford, it is not my ability to thank him for his service to our country in general, but to thank him personally for the inspiration that he provided me, to see what one good and decent man could do for his fellow Americans.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure now to yield such time as he may consume to one who knew President Ford well, the Dean of the House of Representatives, the Honorable JOHN DINGELL from the State of Michigan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend for his kindness and for his yielding me this time. I express to him my gratitude not only for his managing this time, but for bringing this bill to the floor. You have done a good thing, and I say to you, sir, my thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate my dear friend from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) for his part in bringing this matter before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We honor here a great American, a real patriot, a distinguished President, a man who served with distinction in the House, where he had no enemies and legions of friends. He was an honorable and decent man. He was a friendly man. He was uncomplicated. He was good. He was a fine family man, and he was a man with whom any Member of this House on either side of the aisle could work with affection and with respect. We will miss him. He was a great American, and he was a man who left a great tradition  as a Member of this body and as a member of the Appropriations Committee where he served with distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A curious event associated with him is that he always wanted to be Speaker, but never made the grade. By a curious set of circumstances, he was the only man who probably could have been confirmed as Vice President under the constitutional amendment. And by an even more curious circumstance, he was never elected either Vice President or President, and yet he served in both offices with real distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be praying for the repose of his soul. My wife, Deborah, and I knew Gerald Ford and admired him greatly. We extend our condolences to his wonderful wife, Betty, who was his loyal friend, supporter, counselor, and who served his country and him and all of us with distinction and who brought luster not just to her name but also to the name of her distinguished husband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will pray to God He be good to Jerry Ford, and I thank my colleagues for bringing this resolution. It is well deserved by a great American.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would just like to give a few vignettes of Jerry Ford that illustrate the type of man that he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard this afternoon when we discussed this on the floor that he had been active in supporting the Civil Rights Act that passed this House and the Senate some years ago. But this was not an out-of-the-ordinary thing for him. When he was a football player at the University of Michigan, and a very fine one, I might add, undoubtedly the finest athlete to ever occupy the White House, he was the captain of the football team. They were scheduled to play Georgia Tech. There was one African American  football player on the Michigan football team, and Georgia Tech said we cannot allow a black player to play on the field at Georgia Tech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Gerald Ford heard that, he said I will not play either. I am simply not going to play if they will not let my friend, Ward, play. That was the type of person he was. It was not until his African American friend begged him to play that he finally conceded that he would play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another vignette is when he was elevated to the Presidency, we had a big party for him back in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and 5,000 people turned out for our little party. Person after person got up to the microphone and related experiences in their life where Jerry Ford had helped them, whether it was a matter of housing, of veterans benefits, getting medals for veterans. The list went on and on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That accords with another thing that was told me by one of my fellow legislators at the time. He had become a Member of Congress and he said, Sometimes I cursed Jerry Ford. Because of the high standard of constituent service he provided, he said, we worked endlessly in our office to do as well as Jerry Ford and his staff did in his office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Those are two examples. I have more, but I see that the majority leader has arrived, and I know he is anxious to speak on this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), one who did know the President, but, as I observed a few minutes, not quite as long as Representative JOHN DINGELL.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my very distinguished friend for yielding and thank him for his leadership in this Congress, in the great city that he represents and his State of Illinois. He does a wonderful job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join the sponsor of this resolution, my good friend, VERN  EHLERS. VERN EHLERS represents the district, as some of you have already been told, I am sure, I just got to the floor, but I am sure you have been told he represents the district that Gerald Ford represented for a quarter of a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry Ford was my friend. President Ford was someone who I got to know after he was President of the United States. As Mr. Davis observed, I was not in the Congress and did not serve with President Ford. He was, however, a distinguished leader of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to say just a few words, Mr. Speaker, about the contributions of a great American leader, a man who personified integrity, openness, civility and a sense of responsibility, and a man who helped restore public confidence in our institutions of government during a time of national crisis and grave doubt about our government, and that doubt existed here in this country and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Jerry Ford, our Nation's 38th President, took office during a period of American history when deep skepticism was the norm and uncertainty ruled the day. The challenges he faced were not the product of his actions, but he effectively confronted them and helped our proud Nation rise above its "long national nightmare," as he referred to it, and to begin dreaming again about the promise that has been ours since our founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford, of course, never asked to be our Commander in Chief. The responsibilities and burdens of that office were thrust upon him when he chose to answer our Nation's highest calling. That calling came because of the respect that was accorded to him in this House, in the United States Senate and in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He never put partisanship or ambition ahead of the needs of the American people, seeking instead to heal our national wounds. Where he saw division, he built bridges, and where he saw doubt, he nurtured trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be able tonight to serve in the same Chamber where Gerald R. Ford served our Nation for such a long time. I have now served one year longer than Gerald Ford served in this House. He served for 25 years. I am in my 26th year. But no one brought more luster to their service, no one brought more integrity to this House, no one was a better example of what all of us ought to be as Members of this great institution, the People's House, than was Gerald R. Ford of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He offered his talents for seeking compromise and building consensus. I would hope all of us would take a lesson from Gerald Ford as we move ahead over the next 2 years. Too often, the cycle that we enter is a cycle of confrontation rather than consensus creation. We need consensus. America wants consensus. America wants progress. America wants a Congress focused on its need, not a Congress focused on how we can make the other guy look bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford can be an example and should be an example for all of us to emulate. I am honored to have this opportunity to carry on President Ford's steadfast commitment to God, to country, to, obviously, his family, his beloved wife Betty and to the People's House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes without saying that the thoughts and prayers of an indebted Nation are with the Ford family in their time of sorrow. I want to congratulate the Ford family, who conducted themselves with such great dignity and returned the caring of literally tens of thousands of people who came through our Rotunda to honor President Ford and his service and to thank him for that which he has done for our country. Jack and Susan in particular stood for hours greeting people and thanking them for being  there, and the other children as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 26, 2006, we lost a great American, a great leader and a great friend. I was a member of the Appropriations Committee and had the honor of chairing the Treasury-Postal Committee. The Treasury-Postal Committee had under its aegis the retirement funds for our former Presidents, and in that capacity, I had an opportunity to talk to him from time to time, not about his own personal interests, which we did talk about, but that is not why we talked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He talked about the institution. He talked about what we were doing to make this House run better. I can remember we were at a forum at Georgetown together over two decades ago at which we both spoke, and he spoke of the need for having more contested elections, as opposed to districts that were automatic for one party or the other. He said that would be good for democracy, good for discussion of issues and good for the creation of consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford's indomitable spirit will live in these halls of power and service for generations to come, halls that will forever bear the mark of his influence and dedication to the people of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my deepest sympathy to President Ford's beloved wife, Betty, his children and his family and loved ones, and in closing thank him; thank him for being an example to which all of us could repair for service in this body; thank him for being an example for the American people to look to for what a Member of Congress can and ought to be, a man of principle, a man of generosity, a man who cared about his country and its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford, we thank you for your service, and we miss you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to add a few more comments, little vignettes. We have had a lot of discussion today about the wonderful attributes of President Ford as a President, as a Vice President and as a Member of the House of Representatives. Indeed, he was a most gracious person and also a most capable and hardworking person. I appreciate the comments that Majority Leader HOYER made which reflect very accurately what a wonderful person Mr. Ford was. But I want to add just a few examples  from my hometown and my experience with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, at one time, was the Chairman of the County Commission. This was at the time when we were erecting the Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. Of course, he was interested in that and came around regularly. He was retired from the Presidency at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall walking down the street with Mr. Ford. I thought I knew quite a few people there, but walking down the street with him, even though he had not served in Congress for some 10 years at that time, people, of course, would greet him and say, "Hi, Jerry, how are you doing?" They all knew him. The amazing part to me was that he knew them, and he would say, "Hi, Bob. Hi, Shirley. Hi, Jerry. How are you doing?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then another time we walked into the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel, which had been the Pantlind Hotel, and he had stayed there when he came back to Grand Rapids for visits and for meetings. We walked into the hotel lobby, and, of course, a number of people saw him and sort of mobbed him and kept talking to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I noticed a bellman standing off to the side, and it was clear to me that he wanted to speak to Mr. Ford but didn't dare to come up to this group of people. He just thought it wasn't proper. So I mentioned this to President Ford. I said, "I think the bellman wants to talk to you." He said, "Oh, good." So he marches over to him and says, "Harry, how are you doing? It is good to see you again." I didn't know he had a personal relationship with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then he said, "By the way, I heard that your mother has cancer. Is that true? How is she doing?" He then had a 10-minute conversation with this young man about his mother and her health and what had gone on. I am curious how many ex-Presidents would take the time to do that for a bellman that they had known in the past?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, the first time he went to the White House as President and a reporter I know was following him, and as he approached the White House, of course, the Marines stood erect, opened the doors and stood at attention. He came up and held out his hand and said, "Hi, I am Jerry Ford. I am going to be living here. What is your name?" The reporter talked to the Marines at the door after that and said, "Have you ever had that before?" One said, "No, I have been here for several years, and  the previous President has never even looked at me." But, again, that was characteristic of Mr. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final little note. I first got acquainted with him, I am a nuclear scientist, as most of you know. I had moved from Berkley, California, where I got my Ph.D., and I was teaching at  Calvin College. I heard a speech at a national convention from a Congressman who said, "It is terrible. We don't have any scientists in the Congress. We don't have any scientific advice." He said, "I urge you to contact your Member of Congress to see if you can help  them by giving scientific advice."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I took the gentleman at his word. I sent a letter to Congressman Ford and said, "I am a scientist. I have heard there is not much scientific advice there. I would be happy to help you in any way I can."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I dropped the letter in the mailbox, and my first thought was, I would get a nice response that said: Thank you for your comments. We will keep you in mind if we ever need you. But in fact, Mr. Ford was excited about it. The day they got the letter, his chief of staff called me and said, "Jerry is very excited with this and would like to meet with you."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I met with him. I established a science advisory committee, and we met with him quarterly to advise him on scientific matters. What struck me was he was extremely interested in the meetings and in what we were saying, but also very, very quick on catching on to the scientific terms and issues we were discussing, much more so than the average lay person would be able to catch on. So it was a real pleasure for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one day after a meeting, I said, "Mr. Ford, I don't quite understand, because you come back to Grand Rapids, you spend all day in meetings, you spend an hour or hour and a half in a meeting with us just because we want you to know more about science," and I said, "You really seem to enjoy it. Doesn't it get tiresome sometimes?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He put his arm around my shoulder and he said, "Vern, one thing you have to recognize: Everyone else I meet with is asking for something. You are the only group I meet with that is offering me something."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have never forgotten that, and it really gave a lot of meaning to me when I got here in Congress and found out that is true. Almost everyone that walks through our office doors comes in asking for something, not trying to help. So I now appreciate more fully why he appreciated our help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few instances of what a wonderful human being President Ford was, how he related to the people around him, how he was concerned about the people around him and really sought to do what was best for them and what was best for this country. He was a terrific model for the rest of us and for me myself, and I have always tried to serve the people as well as he has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I have no further comments, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I close, let me just first of all commend and thank Representative Ehlers for introducing this resolution. I also want to thank all of those who have come down and taken the time to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summing up the life of President Gerald Ford, I am reminded of something that my mother used to tell us all the time, and that is that if a task is once begun, never leave until it is done; be the labor great or small, do it well or not at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Gerald Ford, wherever he was, did his work well, whether it was on the football field, at the university, in the halls of Congress, as Vice President and ultimately as President of the United States of America, and our country is a better place because of it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join all Americans today in mourning the passing of President Gerald R. Ford and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford became President in the aftermath of Watergate, a scandal that shook to the core the confidence that Americans place in their government. His unquestioned integrity, good humor, and unimpeachable personal character carried this nation through one of the toughest periods of American history. Gerald Ford's legacy is one of steadiness in a time of crisis and of selfless service for his country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 15, Mourning the passing of President Gerald R. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we mourn President Ford, we also celebrate this great American's life and unique contributions to our country. I believe he will be remembered as a devoted and decent man of impeccable integrity who put service to his country before his own self interest. In public life, there can be no higher achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968 President Ford and his family first came to Colorado to ski. He was inspired by the beauty of the area and found a connection to the land and to the surrounding community and ended up buying home in Beaver Creek. When he became President, his vacations in Colorado helped introduce the world to the Town of Vail, and in fact, the family home was dubbed "the Western White House."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coloradans, especially those in the Vail Valley, consider Jerry Ford to be the first President from Colorado because he was a great ambassador for the State who established long ties to the people of Colorado. He was known as the first skiing president, and because of this tireless promotion of Colorado's ski industry, he was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 2001. He was a good neighbor, an avid golfer and a lover of the outdoors. So you can see why I like to claim the former president  as a constituent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his work with charities in Colorado and his contributions to our great state, I've introduced a bill which would rename the Vail Post Office after President Ford, and I hope that the House will take up that bill soon and pass it in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford will rightly be remembered for his personal warmth, his decency, his interest in bridging the many divisions in America during the 1970s. My father, Mo Udall, served in the Congress with him, and while they were often on different sides in political matters they were united by a common view that politics should unite people. I remember a story in 1974 President Ford invited Arizona's senators and representatives to ride on Air Force One for a meeting he was having with Mexico's  president. At the time, Arizona had two Republican senators and three Republican congressmen. They all declined. The one Democratic congressman--my dad--accepted the invitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"All these other politicians don't want Ford to come into their district. Hell, I'm glad to see him in mine," my dad told a person in a crowd outside the place where Ford and the Mexican president were meeting. Mo then went into the crowd and put his arm around the president, telling him how proud Arizona was to have him. "It's a great day for the state."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They both were firm believers that in public life one could disagree without being disagreeable. This is a credo I try to live by and I draw inspiration from my father and from President Ford. They were both practitioners of civility long before the term came a popular term of political art.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a dedicated public servant, President Ford served honorably in his years in Congress and in the White House. Most important, when America needed someone to reassure their trust in government after Watergate, he filled that leadership role with authenticity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Gerald Ford helped heal our nation during a time of crisis, provided steady leadership and restored people's faith in the presidency and in government. We need leaders like him today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late President Gerald R. Ford, who was born in my hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. President Ford will forever be remembered for his great service to the people of the United States of America. He served the people at a complicated and divisive time in our history with honor and distinction. By helping our Nation heal from the political turmoil of Watergate, he helped move us forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was a man of selfless actions based in modest, Midwestern values. As a public servant, I am proud of his efforts; as a Nebraskan, I am proud of our President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was a man who gave up a National Football League career in order to study law and ultimately serve the people in the highest office of public service. His love for our Nation and our American freedoms will live on through our work in Congress and his immortal words, spoken during his 1977 State of the Union Address when he said "The Constitution is the bedrock of all our freedoms. Guard and cherish it, keep honor and order in your own house, and the republic will endure."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a scholar, an athlete, an honorable President, and an even more honorable American. Our nation will truly miss his leadership, honestly and integrity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great friend of this institution, President Gerald Ford. I speak for all of us when I say that our thoughts and our prayers go out to his wife, Betty, and their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born Leslie Lynch King, Jr. in Omaha, Nebraska, President Ford embodied the values and spirit of Nebraska by putting the good of the nation ahead of personal, partisan politics. He was a valued colleague to two branches of our government, who loved and honored our traditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great statesman, he will be hard--if not impossible--to replace. President Ford taught us lessons of unity we will do well to remember as we debate issues that may be divisive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flags hang at half-mast throughout our entire nation to remember a good and decent  man. Though I never met him, I am honored to pay my respects to this great.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member from the Michigan Congressional Delegation I am proud to honor today one of our State's favorite sons, the 38th President of the United States Gerald R. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford is the only person in the history of our Nation to ascend to presidency having never sought either the presidency or the vice presidency. And he did so at one of the most difficult moments in our Nation since the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon assuming office he acknowledged that he had not been elected through the votes of the American people but simply asked for his confirmation through their prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the right man, for the right office at the right time for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made policy decisions not based on political calculation, but on what he believed was in the " best interests of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was not afraid to reach across party lines to find solutions to the myriad of challenges which faced our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man of unquestionable character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to coming to Congress I had the honor to serve as Michigan's Secretary of State and as such served as our State's official historian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my term in office I had the privilege to place a historic marker at the newly renovated boyhood home of President Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that day he spoke of the values instilled in him in that home, in his community and in our great State of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were values that served him well throughout his life and certainly when he assumed the presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Values like honesty. Integrity. Treating every person with respect and dignity. Love of country and a commitment to freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitment to these values was evident throughout his public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a military officer in the Pacific in World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of this House of Representatives for nearly three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the leader of the Republican minority in the House where he proudly voted for and sought votes for landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as Vice President and President of the United States where he helped America recover from what he called our long National nightmare of Watergate and where he concluded the war in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, Gerald R. Ford was a great American worthy of our honor and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our condolences go out to his wonderful and courageous wife Betty and to the entire Ford Family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A grateful Nation owes a debt of gratitude to President Ford for his lifetime of honorable service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May he rest in peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my dearly departed friend, Gerald R. Ford, the 38th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald R. Ford rose to the Presidency at a time when the Nation was in crisis. Disillusioned by Watergate, nervous about an economy in recession, and anxious to get its soldiers out, of war, the country was yearning for a leader who could reestablish a sense of normalcy. So when Ford took over the White House after a short stint as Vice President, and a quarter century in the House of Representatives--even though we disagreed on some fundamental policy issues--I was relieved. I knew Jerry as  an all-American hailing from Grand Rapids, Michigan, a fellow World War II Veteran, and above all, a man of extraordinary character. He was the right man at the right time to restore a divided Nation shaken to its Constitutional roots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Ford left for duty he was considered an "isolationist". When he came back, he was a committed internationalist. It was this change, which I think marks the type of person that my friend Gerald Ford was. Many of today's pundits will call him a "throwback" or a "dying breed". I say he simply possessed a remarkable sense of self, strong patriotism and astute common sense. He looked at the world, saw the conflicts, recognized the need for U.S. leadership, and changed his own opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often today, men and women in public life who change their opinion are derided. Stubborn consstency in the face of rebutting evidence is now considered leadership. But this narrow definition of leadership was never the Ford model. He was a citizen legislator, a stalwart in a grand tradition that stretches back throughout democracy, from the complexities of the 21st century to the founding of Athens. He never sought leadership, it aways came to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his 25 years in Congress, where we worked side-by-side in the Michigan delegation for 17 years, Ford worked hard for his party but also reached out and made many friends abross the aisle. His party elected him as minority leader in 1965, where he served as an effective leader and consensus builder until 1973, when he took over the Vice Presidency under Richard Nixon, replacing Spiro Agnew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did Ford take over the Presidency during one of the toughest times in American history, he did so as a leader whose political party differed from the congressional majority. Ford vetoed an unprecedented 66 bills during his Presidency. Nevertheless, the Congress passed some important laws with bipartisan support under the Ford Administrationl including the Community Development Block Grant, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Elections Campaign Act Amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ford and I worked particularly closely during his presidency on energy matters. Despite our differences, we were able to work together. During the Ford Administration we passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), which established the Nation's first fuel economy standards. Because of his self assuredness and his uncanny ability to think for himself, policy disputes did not deter Ford from working across party lines to achieve success. Nor did partisan bickering preclude bipartisan  friendships: he played golf with political adversary Tip O'Neill and became good friends with Jimmy Carter after Carter defeated him in the 1976 election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was devoted to ensuring that America and the Presidency were in better, shape than when he found it, and above all else, this was his most important accomplishment. His honesty and patriotism should be a model for elected officials today who are often too eager to create a sound bite and too reluctant to find common ground. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my fellow colleagues join me in remembering President Gerald R. Ford, and honoring him by carrying on his legacy of bipartisanship,  honesty and integrity in the years to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 15, and to pay tribute to a dear friend and remarkable American. Today, we honor the life and memory of our Nation's 38th President, Gerald R. Ford. The consideration of this legislation is of great personal importance to me, as I had the honor and distinction of counting President Ford not only as a friend but also as a constituent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These past few weeks, the American people have come to know the story of one of our most beloved leaders, a man who brought our nation together during a tumultuous time and restored faith in our democratic system of government. President Ford famously said, "Our Constitution works, our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men." Yet, the truth is that our system works because of people like Gerald R. Ford and his wonderful wife, Betty--people who dedicated their lives to making  our country strong and improving the prospects for all American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite achieving great success as an athlete, President Ford declined the opportunity to play professional football because he wanted to serve the nation he loved. He went to Yale to study law, served heroically in the U.S. Navy during World War II, honorably represented the people of Michigan in this very House for 25 years, and was selected to serve as Vice President because he had the confidence of the U.S. Congress and was simply the best man for the job. He assumed the Presidency he never  sought because, when called, he never shied from his duty to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His personal integrity was beyond question and his quiet strength steadied our Nation in a time of crisis. President Ford skillfully led our nation through the post-Watergate era, he laid the groundwork for an historic peace accord in the Middle East, and steered our country through tough economic times. History has shown that he was the right leader for those difficult days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In California's Coachella Valley, where President Ford and Betty made their home after leaving the White House, their support of charities, too numerous to mention, helped make them the beloved "first-couple" of the Palm Springs region. As lifelong partners who were truly devoted to one another and to their family, the Fords encouraged millions of dollars in donations to many worthwhile causes. When Betty Ford courageously raised public awareness of dependency issues and founded the recovery  clinic in her name, President Ford stood squarely and quietly behind her every step of the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest sympathy to Betty and the entire Ford family for their loss, a loss we all share. As we begin this Congressional session in the House which he loved so deeply, I think we would be well-served to remember the example of leadership and selfless duty to country that President Ford provided. We celebrate his memory and our Nation is better for his service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in Strong support of House Resolution 15. It is fitting and right that the House remember this highly distinguished citizen of the State of Michigan, and honor his service to the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford's life and legacy define the term "public servant." He served with distinction in World War II aboard the U.S.S. Monterrey. In 1948, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served with integrity for 25 years. In 1974, during one of the darkest moments in U.S. history, Gerald Ford served as our Nation's 38th President, and restored integrity to the Presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Nation has honored President Ford over the course of the last week, I have been struck by how many have made mention of his honesty, trustworthiness and essential decency. As the first President Bush said of his one-time colleague in the House of Representatives at the memorial service at Washington Cathedral last week, "to political ally and adversary alike, Jerry Ford's word was always good."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford will also be remembered for believing that America is strongest when we work together and work with others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford has left us a rich legacy. As we begin this new Congress, I hope all of us here will honor him by taking to heart that legacy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="15">H. Res. 15</bill>. This resolution mourns the passing of Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr., the 38 President of the United States, and honors his lifetime of outstanding leadership and service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., in 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska. Soon after his birth, his mother moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she remarried and he was adopted and renamed after his stepfather, Gerald Rudolph Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in high school, Jerry Ford was an outstanding student and athlete, and Eagle Scout. He went on to achieve a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Michigan, where he majored in economics and political science. He also played on the University's 1932 and 1933 national championship football teams and was selected to several college All-American football teams. Indeed, Jerry Ford was such a gifted football player that he was offered contracts by the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers. But  he turned them down to accept a coaching position at Yale University, in hopes of gaining admission to its law school. His perseverance paid off and he was admitted in 1938. He graduated in the top third of his class with an LL.B. in 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford returned to Grand Rapids to practice law and teach a course at the University of Grand Rapids. He also helped coach the Grand Rapids football team. After the United States entered World War II, he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve, serving on the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey. In 1944, he narrowly survived a deadly typhoon in the Philippine Sea. In 1946 he completed his military service and was honorably discharged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon returning home to Grand Rapids, Jerry Ford resumed his law practice, this time with a more "internationalist" outlook due to his experiences abroad. He was elected to Congress with more than 60 percent of the vote in 1948 after ousting an isolationist incumbent in the Republican primary. During the 1948 campaign, Jerry married the outspoken advocate of women's rights, Elizabeth Anne Bloomer Warren, whom we all know and love as "Betty." Jerry Ford was elected to Congress 13 times by his  constituents, never once receiving less than 60 percent of the vote. In October 1973, he was nominated to be Vice-President by President Richard Nixon and assumed the office after being confirmed by both the House and the Senate. In fact, Jerry Ford holds the distinction of being the only person in history to be confirmed by both chambers of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At noon on August 9, 1974, upon the resignation of President Nixon, Jerry Ford became the 38th President of the United States. In addressing the Nation after taking the oath of office, President Ford said: "My fellow American's, our long national nightmare is over." And he was right. Over the next twenty-nine months, President Ford did so much, by word and deed, to restore public confidence in the institutions of government. In the final analysis, President Ford's lasting legacy is "all he  did to heal our land," as his predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, memorably put it in his 1977 Inaugural Address. There is perhaps no more deserving recipient of the Medal of Freedom, an honor bestowed on President Ford in 2000 by President Bill Clinton. In 1999, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and in 2001, he was presented the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I salute President Ford for his outstanding and patriotic service, especially his efforts as President to unite and heal the Nation in a time when it had lost all confidence in its officials. I strongly urge all members to join me in supporting this resolution honoring and celebrating the late President Gerald R. Ford and his lifetime of achievement and service to our country. We mourn the death but celebrate the life of this great American, this great president, and former Minority  Leader of this House.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former President and U.S. Congressman Gerald R. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford, who is often referred to as "Michigan's Greatest Son," worked hard wherever his life led him and based his decisions upon what he felt was the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A star football player with my alma mater, the University of Michigan, he turned down offers to play in the National Football League to study law at Yale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then volunteered to serve his country in the Navy during World War II before returning to Michigan to put his law degree to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He later defeated an incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his own party's primary, which from my own experience is an incredibly difficult endeavor. His colleagues later elected him to the highest leadership position among Republicans in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford admittedly did not seek the greatness of the U.S. presidency, but destiny determined that he would become the right man in the right place at the right time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford allowed the country to move forward by pardoning Richard Nixon, although it likely contributed to him failing to win the 1976 election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He helped to unite a divided nation, even when he knew that it would likely result in a great personal cost. He made the decision because he knew that if he did not, our country would spend the months and years looking back and not ahead. For him it was simply the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He conducted himself with integrity and character throughout every step of his distinguished career. He set a very high standard for those of us in West Michigan who would follow him to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legacy he leaves to join his Creator will impact not only the officeholders who follow in his footsteps, but generations of Americans to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for <bill type="hr" number="15">H. Res. 15</bill>, a House Resolution mourning the passing of former President Gerald Ford of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life and his career, Jerry Ford exhibited the highest standards of courage, wisdom, integrity, and civility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor of serving with President Ford's brother, Thomas, in the Michigan legislature before I was elected to Congress in 1976.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I was one of those who questioned President Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon at the time he did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But by the time Ford gave his final State of the Union speech in January 1977, I, and most of the Nation, had come to realize the rightness of his decision to pardon Nixon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I vividly remember the sustained and prolonged applause, from both sides of the aisle, for President Ford during his January 1977 State of the Union Address to the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He took the Office of the Presidency at a very difficult and troubled time for our Nation and for our world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had previously served his country with honor as a naval officer during World War Two, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the State of Michigan, and as the minority leader of the U.S. House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when his country needed him the most, he served in the highest office in the land, as President of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the right person, at the right time, in the right office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He guided our Nation through a very difficult time and he helped in the healing process which our Country so deeply needed at that time in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Jerry Ford loved this Country, he loved his house, he loved his State of Michigan, and he certainly loved his wife Betty and their children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and our prayers are with them as we honor Jerry Ford today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the great President Gerald R. Ford, who has recently passed away. Gerald Ford was not only America's 38th president but he was also a dedicated husband, father, athlete and WWII veteran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Nebraska, Ford was an athletic young man. He was the star of his high school football team and continued to play football as a college student at the University of Michigan. He then went on to receive his law degree from Yale University. Shortly after graduating from Yale, Ford received a commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve and received numerous awards for his bravery and service during WWII. After returning from the war, Ford became more involved in politics, serving as member  of the House of Representatives for 25 years, including 8 years as the Minority leader, and later becoming Vice President before taking the oath as President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford took power following one of the most difficult times in our Nation's history and brought America back together. Gerald Ford was a noble, honorable man who emerged as a leader at a time when Americans were questioning their government.  President Ford showed us that strength and integrity are indisputably important traits to have in order to successfully lead our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As power has just changed hands in Congress, it is my hope that we will heed the legacy of Gerald Ford and always seek to stand together to face the challenges of the future. Gerald Ford will be sorely missed by all of the Americans that he touched. My heart goes out to all of his family members.</paragraph>
