  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from American Samoa?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first thank our distinguished chairman of the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and our senior ranking member, the gentlelady from Florida, for their support and for their leadership in bringing this bill before the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me thank our eminent colleague in the other Chamber, the distinguished Senator from Indiana (Senator Lugar) for his leadership on this important issue. It is exemplary of his sage leadership on so many foreign affairs matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in 1777, while serving the American cause in Paris, Benjamin Franklin discovered a brilliant Polish military tactician. His name was Casimir Pulaski. A leader in Poland's bitter campaign to beat back Russia, the nobleman Pulaski sacrificed his status in Europe to join the American revolution in the New World. It did not take long for George Washington to recognize the great talent he had on his hands. He promoted Pulaski to brigadier general, placing him in charge of four horse  brigades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pulaski's prowess and strategic skill during the Revolutionary War became renowned. So dedicated was he to our cause that when funding ran low among the colonials, he used some of his own money to purchase equipment for his men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Pulaski, who eventually went down in the history books as the father of the American cavalry, is just one of the many important Polish figures who have contributed greatly to the United States and to the world. The relationship between the people of our two countries has flourished in recent years since the fall of communism, but it actually dates back centuries to the founding of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this Congress aims to help the people of Poland rear the next generation of productive, inventive and standout individuals. This bill authorizes an educational exchange program between our two nations that promises to be mutually beneficial and strengthen the alliance between our two nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program will be identical in its structure and operation to the successful Congress-Bundestag exchange that was launched in 1983. Over the last quarter century, thousands of young Americans and Germans have seized the opportunity to spend an academic year living and studying with their foreign peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, these secondary school students have gained a better understanding of each other's way of life and have begun developing into citizens of the world. With the authorization and funding of the bilateral initiative before us today, we will extend the same opportunities to our young friends in Poland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cross-cultural exchange is the most powerful way of creating harmony among nations. And study abroad programs represent the most powerful type of exchange because they foster understanding and education about other nations at an early age. The country of Poland is one of our most important allies in Europe, has supported us in our fight against terrorism, and stood with us by contributing troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. The Polish people have made great strides since the fall of communism liberalizing  their economy, joining NATO in 1999, and becoming a Member of the European Union in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is high time that we recognize and advance Poland's place in the world, as well as our special relationship with that nation, by initiating a robust educational exchange program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this proposed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill 377, the United States-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, introduced by Senator Lugar, and already passed by the Senate in March, would establish a formal parliamentary youth exchange program for American and Polish secondary students. The purpose of this exchange program is to demonstrate to the youth of Poland and to the United States the benefits of friendly cooperation based on our shared political and cultural values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States and Poland have enjoyed close bilateral relations since the end of the Cold War. Poland has supported U.S.-led efforts to fight global terrorism, has contributed troops to coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has cooperated closely with the United States to promote democracy and human rights around the world and to reform the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>By focusing on the source of our common future, our young people, this bill will further cement the friendship and the ideals that our two nations already  share. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure that I yield 3 minutes to my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut and a member of the Financial Services and Government Reform Committees, Congressman Murphy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support today of <bill type="s" number="377">S. 377</bill>, the United States and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poland, as has been said by both of our previous speakers, has demonstrated an amazing commitment both to democratic values and to their role as an ally of the United States. I remember, as a teenager, if I might date myself, watching in rapt attention as Lech Walesa and his solidarity movement defeated the Communist Party in Poland in parliamentary elections, and then watching Walesa go on to become president of Poland in 1990. That solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communism across  Eastern Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This United States and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange will allow American students to learn much more about this very important heritage of our neighbors in Eastern Europe. Eligible participants in the program will attend a public high school for one academic year and enroll in courses that place a particular emphasis on their host country's history, the establishment of its Constitution, the nation's birth and its political development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though my last name might not give a hint to this, I am a very proud Polish American. My mother's family emigrated from Poland to New Britain, Connecticut some generations ago. And if you have a chance to drive through the great State of Connecticut and you're looking for a great place to grab a bite to eat, stop off in New Britain, Connecticut. Go to Broad Street, where we still have Polish language storefronts selling some of the best Polish food that you'll find in eastern Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate the gentleman spending a little time remarking about General Pulaski. We take that legacy very seriously in New Britain. We still celebrate Pulaski Day with a Pulaski parade that runs not very far from Pulaski School and ends up at the Pulaski Club. So we are very serious students of Polish history in New Britain, Connecticut, and I can't think of a better program than one such as this that will allow children of a community such as ours in New Britain, whose forefathers came  from that country, to be able to go there and strengthen their appreciation for that culture and that country's heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank Representative Visclosky, especially, and Representative Emanuel for bringing this legislation before the House floor today and, of course, Senator Lugar for being such a champion in the Senate. This will mean a great deal to our small community of New Britain and the entire Polish American community in the Fifth District of Connecticut.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Connecticut and his support and statement. Nothing like having an Irish Polish American to be supportive of his proposed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would love to yield 5 minutes now to my dear friend, distinguished member of the Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky). That's a good Polish name.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="s" number="377">S. 377</bill>, the United States and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act of 2007. I am the sponsor of the House version of this legislation, and I would like to thank my 13 colleagues, including the gentleman from Connecticut, who are cosponsors of the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would especially like to thank the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Indiana, Richard Lugar, for originating this legislation and introducing it in the other body. And I would be remiss if I did not thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega), as well as the ranking member of the full committee, the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), as well as Mr. Lantos and the members of the committee  for their consideration of the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sincere hope that this legislation will become the foundation for future youth exchange programs around the world. As technology and transportation makes the world more and more interconnected, it is essential that our youth and future leaders have firsthand experiences in other cultures when making decisions. A lot can be learned about a different culture from a book or a picture, but it is not nearly the same as living, studying and working in another culture for an entire year, which  is what the U.S.-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program will enable youths from American and Polish high schools to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lugar has been a guiding light in promoting cultural exchange programs between America and countless other countries throughout his tenure, and it has been my privilege to work with him on this legislation. The Senator's genuine interest in the cultures of the world is reflected in all his actions, and he understands the priceless value of cultural exchange programs as embodied in the U.S. and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program. This program will have a profound effect  on the youth of our two countries, and it can only strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the United States and Poland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I too am very proud of the Polish community in Indiana's First Congressional District. This proud community is an integral part of the greater northwest area community in Indiana, and enhances the culture of my district in countless ways. I am happy that the U.S. and Poland Youth Exchange Program will allow all facets of the Polish culture to be experienced firsthand by American youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we should not delay in this opportunity for our youth to be immersed in Poland's rich culture and in this opportunity to share our culture with Polish youth. And I would urge my colleagues to support the measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for his most eloquent speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me commend Senator Lugar for this fine legislation. Senator Lugar is such an outstanding leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would also like to say that Count Casimir Pulaski was a person, as a historian, that did so much in the Revolutionary War. We actually defeated Cromwell at the major battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity also to teach at Pulaski School in New Jersey when I was a school teacher in Passaic, and the Polish community was very strong in that area. And so I learned a lot, from Yak Samas and Dobcha, from my students and their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that parliamentary exchanges are outstanding. As we remember Lech Walesa and the solidarity movement, we do see the challenge for the shipyards there in Poland, but hopefully they will be able to sustain themselves. I think that these various types of parliamentary exchanges do a great deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited Poland in 1967 and went back again in the late 1990s and early 2000 to see the tremendous difference of the 1967 Poland that was drab and going through many, many problems with pollution and the communist system. But with the breakdown of the Warsaw Pact and Poland being able to have democracy, it's really a tremendous country. And as a member of the House Democratic Assistance Corporation here in the House, we certainly strongly push for parliamentary exchanges, and so I certainly  support this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Eni Faleomavaega for bringing this to the floor.</paragraph>
