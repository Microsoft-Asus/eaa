  <speaking speaker="400081" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we were privileged today to have deliver our opening prayer the Reverend Kenn Hucks from Lebanon, Tennessee, Immanuel Baptist Church, formerly in Bart Gordon's district, and now in my district. We are also privileged to have his beautiful wife Kim with us today sitting in the family gallery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a church that started in 1947 with just a few dozen members, and now it is in the top 1 percent of the Tennessee Baptist and the Southern Baptist Conventions, due to a long line of inspirational pastors, the latest of whom is Kenn Hucks, who joined the congregation, was called to the ministry in 2002. We appreciate his great spiritual leadership in our community, and we appreciate his being with us today.</paragraph>
