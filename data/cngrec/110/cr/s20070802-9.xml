    <paragraph>Mr. President, with regard to the tragedy in Minneapolis, our colleagues, Senators COLEMAN and KLOBUCHAR, are either there or on the way there today to not only extend their condolences to their constituents who have been impacted by this but to be as helpful as possible as they go forward with the rescue mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of the situation in my State, where the Ohio River goes along the northern border of Kentucky, almost for the entire State, and then when it empties into the Mississippi, it goes southward--the same river over which the Minneapolis bridge collapsed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have bridges all along both the Ohio and the Mississippi. Bridge construction and safety has been a big issue in the Commonwealth of Kentucky in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share the concerns of the majority leader about reports of the state of our infrastructure in America. We all pray for the victims of the Minneapolis tragedy. It may well serve as a reminder of our need to be ever aware of the dangers that confront our infrastructure in this country.</paragraph>
