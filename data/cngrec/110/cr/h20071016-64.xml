    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the life of Vernon Bellecourt of Minnesota, a selfless servant who committed his life not just to fight for American Indians but for the rights of all people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night I was at a funeral service for Mr. Bellecourt, and while I regret to report the recent passing of Mr. Bellecourt at age 75, I am grateful for his spirit of equality and inclusiveness which will continue to live on in the Twin Cities of Minnesota and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bellecourt, a member of the Ojibwe Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, came to St. Paul from Minnesota's White Earth Indian Reservation. As a skilled communicator and a natural leader, Vernon championed the power of community. He practiced what he preached, solidifying his commitment to community by operating several small businesses. And while Vernon was a businessman, his greatest contribution was as a human rights leader around the world and in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read a little bit from the Washington Post obituary that appeared today in the paper:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Vernon Bellecourt, who fought to restore land and dignity to Native Americans and against the use of Indian nicknames for sports teams as a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM) died October 13 of complications of pneumonia at a Minneapolis hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Since leaving behind careers as a hair stylist and real estate agent and joining his brother" Clyde Bellecourt "at AIM in the 1970s, Mr. Bellecourt had been in the forefront of the movement to ensure that treaty rights of Native American tribes and the U.S. Government would be fulfilled. He was president of the National Coalition of Racism in Sports and the Media and a principal spokesman for AIM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He was involved in numerous demonstrations to bring attention to his causes, including the 1972 occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington and the 1992 Super Bowl rally to protest the name of Washington's football team. He also spoke at colleges and universities around the world about more than 400 treaties that the group believed the U.S. was not honoring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Clyde Bellecourt, a founding member of AIM, said yesterday that his brother had been in Venezuela about 4 weeks ago" to talk about "providing heating assistance to American tribes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me wrap up and say that Vernon Bellecourt brought an issue to the attention of the American people that most of us walk past very quickly. Most of us would look at Native American sports team mascots and think no big deal. But just imagine, if you would, Mr. Speaker, teams called the Chicago Negroes or the Washington Caucasians. None of us would appreciate that kind of depiction of our ethnicity, and Mr. Bellecourt didn't appreciate it either. And he helped elevate the self-esteem  of young Native Americans and also helped us understand our common humanity as we respect each other due to his inspirational work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I met Mr. Bellecourt in the early 1980s in Detroit, Michigan, when he was standing up for Native Americans at the Hopi Indian Reservation as they were in a conflict with Peabody Coal Company over land and treaty rights. I got to know him better when I joined him in northern Wisconsin, standing on the docks to stand up for Native American treaty rights. And whether you agree with him or not, Mr. Speaker, he embodied the spirit of an American standing up for  what you believe in, speaking out for what is right, speaking up for the people who don't have a voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Vernon Bellecourt will be sorely missed and will never be forgotten. In my opinion, he is a great man and he has helped us discover ourselves in a deeper and more meaningful way. May God bless Vernon Bellecourt and sympathy for his family.</paragraph>
