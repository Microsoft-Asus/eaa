    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill> is a bill to designate the new courthouse in Brooklyn at Cadman Plaza in honor of former Member and New York Governor Hugh Carey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hugh Carey began his distinguished public career in 1960 when he was elected to the House of Representatives. He served on the former Education and Labor Committee, the Interior Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. During his seven terms, he became the deputy whip and helped pass several pieces of landmark legislation on education and the rights of the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Governor, Carey signed the historic Willowbrook consent decree, which committed New York to sweeping reforms in the care of the developmentally disabled. He also dealt with Love Canal and pollution of the Hudson River. Along with Senator Kennedy and former Speaker Tip O'Neill, he worked to end violence in Northern Ireland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is truly a son of New York, a great civic leader and esteemed public servant. For these and other reasons, it is both fitting and proper to honor Hugh Carey with this designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill> does designate the United States courthouse which is located at 225 Cadman Plaza East in Brooklyn, New York as the "Hugh L. Carey United States Courthouse."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Iowa pointed out, the Governor served in the United States Army during World War II and then received his law degree from St. John's University School of Law. In 1960 he was elected to represent the 12th Congressional District of New York in the 87th Congress and served until his resignation in 1974, when he was elected Governor of New York, and he served two terms as Governor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might also point out that in 1993, Governor Carey was appointed to the American Battle Monuments Commission to represent the United States at various ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Governor Carey is currently practicing law in New York City, as I understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think this is a fitting tribute to Governor Carey's commitment to public service, and I wholeheartedly support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Graves for those kind words and appreciate his support and work on this very appropriate naming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the acceptance of <bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill>, a bill to designate the newly-constructed courthouse located at 225 Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, New York, as the "Hugh L. Carey United States Courthouse".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hugh Carey was born in 1919, in Brooklyn, where he attended local schools. He graduated from St. John's University and, in 1951, graduated from St. John's Law School. During World War II, he fought in Europe with the 104th Division. For his valor, he received the Bronze Star, Croix de Guerre, and Combat Infantry Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hugh Carey served the people of New York for almost three decades, first as a Congressman representing Brooklyn and then as Governor of the State. Congressman Carey served seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1960 until 1974. In 1974, he was elected as Governor of New York in a landslide victory. He served two full terms as Governor until being succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor, Mario Cuomo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carey's public career is highlighted by his handling of the city's economic crisis in the late 1970s. As part of this effort he spearheaded the construction of the Jacob Javits Center, Battery Park City, and South Street Seaport. He was a fierce opponent of the death penalty and, as Governor, prevented the reinstatement of the death penalty in the State of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carey was a master at forming coalitions between business and labor. This ability helped save the city from fiscal crisis in the late 1970s. During that time, he worked diligently to attract businesses to the State mainly by reducing State taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Carey, who will be 88 in April, still practices law in New York. This designation will honor the truly outstanding, civic career of one of New York's finest public servants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill> and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="429">H.R. 429</bill>.</chair>
