    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want everyone--especially my Republican colleagues and especially the people in the White House--to listen to what I am going to say. FISA, if we don't do something on it today, will expire. It will be out of business. The House is going out of session tonight, so unless we get to them the 30-day extension we have tried to move forward five or six times, unless we have an extension of 18 months, a year, 2 weeks, whatever the Republicans think is appropriate--if they  think nothing is appropriate--then the full brunt of this law expiring is on their shoulders because it is virtually legislatively impossible to get anything done today. Remember, the House has already done what they are going to do. If we took what the Intelligence Committee passed, which is likely</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the orders that have been sought and accomplished during the time since last August will still be in effect, and, of course, there will be an opportunity under the old FISA law to  work on an emergency basis for new things they want to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to maintain the ability to go after the bad people. We believe there is a necessity for intercepting telephone conversations between people who are trying to do bad things. We think it should be within the constitutional framework, and we believe that is what the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee have done. But I again say, without getting into any details, unless we do something today, unless someone can explain to me how we can pass something here in a matter of a few  hours, how we can have a conference with the House in a matter of a few hours and then bring those two conference reports to the House and the Senate in a few hours--I say that is legislatively impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am saying again to my Republican colleagues: Agree to some extension of time or the burden of this legislation not passing is on your shoulders because we have had no attempt to legislate. We have not had the opportunity to offer amendments, let alone vote on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our goal is to provide the intelligence community with all of the legal tools it needs, while protecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans. So I would hope that in the next hour or so, we can work something out before the House leaves town or nothing will have been accomplished.</paragraph>
