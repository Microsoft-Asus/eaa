    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the critical community service being performed by the Rotary Club of Clemmons, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clemmons Rotary Club launched a unique initiative this year to boost awareness of organ and tissue donor programs in North Carolina. They have spruced up the sides of about a dozen semi-truck trailers with huge public service ads, calling attention to the constant need for organ donors in North Carolina. Each truck highlights organ donor programs in North Carolina and directs potential donors to visit www.DonateLifeNC.org.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, about 3,000 people in North Carolina are awaiting life-saving organ transplants. The Clemmons Rotary's Billboards on Wheels program is going to improve the lives of these people in need of an organ transplant in North Carolina. In fact, this brilliant marketing idea is beginning to garner some national attention from other rotary clubs that would like to replicate this program in States other than North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trend-setting people of the rotary club are model citizens who are working to make our world a healthier and more livable place. I hope that their good deeds inspire others to take up this great outreach idea and to help match donors with those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I also want to call special attention to the innovation and hard work of the students involved in West Wilkes High School's electric vehicle program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the guidance and direction of Advisor Chris Tolbert, students in the West Wilkes electric vehicle program have completely rebuilt two vehicles--a Ford pickup and a Mazda Miata--into fully functional electric cars. This award-winning electric vehicle program is exactly the sort of program we need to help teach young people the skills and technology of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Mr. Tolbert and the students at West Wilkes for their forward-thinking mindset. These students have custom-built electric cars, cars without gas engines, from the ground up. This is a herculean accomplishment with more than 3,000 hours of hard work going into the design and building of the Mazda Miata alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, their hard work is paying dividends. Not only are they investing in a cleaner environment and in an economy that is less dependent on gas and oil, but they have brought home many awards and have captured national attention for their electric car innovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month, they won multiple awards at the SMARTT Challenge competition in Raleigh. The SMARTT electric vehicle challenge, which draws hundreds of students from across the southeast, stands for Students Making Advancements in Renewable Transportation Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The students and teachers at West Wilkes High School are on the cutting edge of hands-on instruction and learning, and I congratulate them for maintaining one of the best high school electric vehicle programs in the Nation. I hope they'll keep up the good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This leads me into my next comments, Mr. Speaker. The Democrats are inventing false arguments again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Use it or lose it" is already the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Federal onshore competitive oil and gas leases, an oil company must have a producing well by 10 years. This comes from section 17(e) of the Mineral Leasing Act, (source: 30 U.S.C. 226(e)). Prior to 1992, the lease term was 5 years. The Energy Policy Act of 1992, under a Democrat House, modified it to 10 years. For Federal offshore oil and gas leases, an oil company must produce energy between 5 and 10 years. This is from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So House Democrats do not even know what is existing law. What Democrats would have you believe is that a lease is a license to produce oil and gas. It is not. A lease is only the start of a process involving several steps the government requires an oil company to take before it may get permission to drill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are effectively arguing that we should pull leases away from oil companies before they even receive permission to drill. That's like saying we should flunk a first grader on his first day of school because he has not yet taken his final exam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of the drilling on Federal leases has been for natural gas. Natural gas  production was up, way up last year, and so was demand. In fact, the industry is producing more gas under these leases, but they cannot keep up with demand because Democrats and their radical environmental allies will not allow the leasing of new areas. Ninety-seven percent of Federal offshore areas are not leased. Ninety-four percent of Federal onshore areas are not leased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I say, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are inventing false arguments to keep us from increasing our supply of energy in this country.</paragraph>
