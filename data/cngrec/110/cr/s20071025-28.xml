    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the passing of Wynn Speece. Wynn passed away on October 22, at Avera Sacred Heart Hospital in Yankton, SD, at the age of 90.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many will remember Wynn as the "Neighbor Lady" from her WNAX talk radio show. For 64 years her voice came into the homes of countless Midwestern families. Her household tips, recipes, and personal anecdotes will be missed not only by South Dakotans but also by her many listeners throughout the Midwestern region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wynn grew up in Marshalltown, IA, where she took a special interest in home economics and theater. Upon her graduation from high school, she continued her education at Drake University where she majored in speech with a broadcasting emphasis. After her graduation in 1939, she took a job writing commercials for WNAX in Yankton, SD. It took 2 years of writing before WNAX gave Wynn her very own show. From the first show she was an instant success, and that success would follow the "Neighbor Lady"  for the next 64 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wynn won several awards for outstanding radio work. She was presented with the prestigious Marconi Award for "Best Small-Market Radio Personality" and was named one of the top 10 Yankton citizens of the 20th century by the Yankton Press and Dakotan. Not only was Wynn a celebrated radio host, but she also worked hard to make a positive impact on the community of Yankton. Her local involvement and selfless giving earned Wynn the 1991 Yankton Community Citizen of the Year Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wynn Speece was an extraordinary woman and a great South Dakotan who will be greatly missed by all who knew her.</paragraph>
