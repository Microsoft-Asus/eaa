  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, pursuant to section 301 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, I previously filed revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution. Those revisions were made for legislation reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress cleared <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> on September 27, 2007. The President vetoed that legislation on October 3, 2007. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives was unsuccessful today in its attempt to override that veto. Consequently, I am further revising the 2008 budget resolution and reversing the adjustments previously made pursuant to section 301 to the aggregates and the allocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
