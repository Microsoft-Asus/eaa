  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a new report from the Budget and Appropriations Committee says that the new Congress faces a fiscal challenge of historic proportions. The cost of the war in Iraq, coupled with the growing price tag of tax cuts passed over the previous 6 years, have left the Nation deeper in debt than ever before and with one of the largest benefit deficits in the Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Democrats committed to begin the process of restoring fiscal sanity by reinstituting a budget rule that helped Congress create a surplus in the 1990s. It is this fiscal discipline that is so important to House Democrats that we restored a pay-as-you-go budget rule on the second day of this new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, historic debts are not good for any of us. They lead to rising interest rates, which cost middle-class families as much as $1,700 a year on credit card and mortgage payments. It also simply is irresponsible of us to continue to pass this debt on to future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week we will pass a final budget for the 2007 fiscal year after Republicans refused to pass these must-pass appropriations bills last year. It's time we get our fiscal house in order.</paragraph>
