    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 764 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="764">H. Res. 764</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (<bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>) to express the policy of the United States regarding the United States relationship with Native Hawaiians and to provide a process for the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian governing entity. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The bill shall be considered as read.

  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington, my good friend, Representative Hastings. All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials into the Record.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 764 provides a structured rule for consideration of <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The resolution provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule makes in order an amendment offered by Representative Flake of Arizona. This was the only amendment submitted to the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't intend to speak for long about this legislation other than to express my sincere hope that this body will move forward expeditiously with its passage. Our Nation is greater because of its vast diversity and the living narrative of all those who contribute to it. However, make no mistake, our government has treated a number of cultural communities in a less than favorable manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are not here to debate the particulars of our Nation's dealings with Native Hawaiians. However, it is only right that all indigenous people should have a right to determine how they should interact with our government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my good friend from Hawaii, Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE, mentioned in the Rules Committee, the current system of land tenure for Native Hawaiians is organized under the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. This State agency does not meet the needs of Native Hawaiians in the most effective manner as it is currently arranged. What the community demands and needs is an entity in which the Native Hawaiians can be effectively engaged. Rightfully, this legislation will give Native Hawaiians an  opportunity to create such an entity and empower themselves with self-determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to make note of my concern that there are some in this body who are seeking to create controversy where none exists. Contrary to what some say today, this bill does not allow gaming on Native Hawaiian lands, nor does it lay the groundwork for gaming. On the contrary, it takes the necessary steps to put Native Hawaiians on the necessary path to control their destiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, similar legislation has passed the House in the 106th Congress and was reported out of the Natural Resources Committee in both the 107th and 109th Congresses. Unfortunately, the measure was never taken any further until today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this rule provides the appropriate framework for debate on this bipartisan legislation, which is the culmination of many years of negotiation. I have been in this body, and I have seen NEIL ABERCROMBIE, and now MAZIE HIRONO, and before, Patsy Mink, work actively on this particular legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of amendments submitted to the Rules Committee for this legislation is a testament to years of bipartisan collaboration. It is only right that we bring this legislation to the full floor today in this manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and namesake from Florida (Mr. Hastings) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation, offered in good faith by my friend and colleague from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), would create a process, and I want to emphasize "process," because that is what this is, for establishing and recognizing a Native Hawaiian government entity that would be empowered to act on behalf of its members with the State and Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Mr. Speaker, as the Wall Street Journal noted in 2005, the practical effect of granting this status to self-identified Native Hawaiians would be to allow this new class of American citizens to declare, and I quote again from the Wall Street Journal, "complete legal and territorial independence from the United States and the establishment of a Hawaiian nation-state."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before this statement is dismissed out of hand as a completely unbelievable statement dreamed up by the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, I should mention that they were not the ones that were making this claim. They were merely reporting on a statement made by the State Office of Hawaiian Affairs, which first acknowledged this fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, a recent statement made by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission raised concerns that this legislation, and, again, I quote from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, "would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide American people into discrete subgroups according to various degrees of privilege."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the best efforts of this legislation's advocates to compare Native Americans with Native American tribes who govern reservations and often live on them, this legislation would make it possible for our next-door neighbors in Hawaii to suddenly coexist under different legal regimes, a clear violation of the 14th amendment of the Constitution's equal protection clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, because this legislation would grant broad governmental powers to a racially defined group, to include all living descendants. The new Native Hawaiians created by this bill would need no geographic, political or cultural connection to Hawaii, much less a physical connection to a distinct Native Hawaiian community. As the Federal courts have recently explained, this is problematic. Again, I quote the Federal courts: "The history of the indigenous Hawaiians is fundamentally different  from that of indigenous groups in federally recognized Indian tribes in the continental United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation raises significant constitutional concerns, which have been raised on other bills this year, namely, <bill type="h" number="8345">H.R. 8345</bill>, the Hawaiian Ownership Act of 2007, which the House considered in March of this year. The Hawaiian Township Act initially failed under suspension of the rules because 162 Members of the House recognized, and in 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in Rice v. Cayetano, that the current configuration of Justices would likely strike down the Federal benefits  flowing to Native Americans as an unconstitutional racial set-aside, if given the chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe that there are legitimate constitutional concerns that must be addressed in the underlying Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that the rule makes in order an amendment to be offered by Mr. Flake of Arizona that would attempt to address the constitutional concerns and ensure the underlying legislation complies with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to my friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), who is an original sponsor of this measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412200" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule. I thank Chairman Slaughter and Vice Chair MCGOVERN for the rule which fairly gives the only amendment to be filed due consideration pursuant to House rules. I disagree with the amendment because it, if adopted, unnecessarily creates confusion where none exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization bill is a good one, the result of over 6 years of fine-tuning and negotiations, including significant compromises with the Department of Justice, Department of the Interior, and the Office of Management and Budget to conceive a law that should be approved by all persons concerned with the welfare of Native Hawaiians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is supported by the Republican Governor of the State of Hawaii, the Hawaii State legislature, the American Bar Association, the National Congress of American Indians, the National Education Association, the NAACP, League of United Latin American Citizens, and dozens of other civil rights, professional associations and unions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will enter into the Record a list of all supporters of this measure, as well as letters of support from the Governor of the State of Hawaii, Linda Lingle; the American Bar Association; National Congress of American Indians; and the Japanese American Citizens League, and thank them for their wholehearted support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me close by quoting a sentence from the letter from the National Congress of American Indians, which is of particular relevance to the proposed amendment to be offered. "To invoke the equal protection or due process clause of the Constitution in this context, as some of the legislation's critics attempt to do, is a perversion of what those clauses were intended to do. Those submitting this argument are using the very cornerstones of justice and fairness in our democracy to deny  equal protection to one group of indigenous people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to adopt the rule so we may get on to the merits of this important legislation that will at long last afford the Native Hawaiian people self-determination and self-governance long given to other indigenous people of the United States but denied to Native Hawaiians.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>AMERICAN INDIANS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 22, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I am writing on behalf of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the nation's oldest and largest organization of tribal governments, to express our strong support of <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. As this matter has made its way through Congress, the NCAI member tribes have consistently passed resolutions supporting the Native Hawaiian right to self-determination (attached). NCAI and the tribal nations we represent continue  to support  Native Hawaiian people in their efforts towards a path to self-determination, and we urge you to do the same by voting in favor of <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill> would reaffirm the Native Hawaiian right to self-governance and enable the creation of a process that will lead to self-determination and economic self-sufficiency for Native Hawaiian people. Like all of the nation's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians lived on their homelands and governed their own affairs before the first contact with Europeans until the overthrow of the Native Hawaiian government in 1893. Since that time, Native Hawaiians have continued to suffer more than a century  of injustice, including neglect and abuse of Native Hawaiian entitlements and civil rights, by the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all of the indigenous peoples of the United States, Native Hawaiians deserve the right to determine their own future. The purpose of self-determination is not simply for its own sake. Rather, it is what enables indigenous people to maintain their culture, language, and identity. This is a purpose that all American citizens can support. Congress has consistently supported Native Hawaiian recognition through numerous programs intended to benefit Native Hawaiians along with the other indigenous  peoples of the United States. Furthermore, it is a purpose that was recently affirmed by the United Nations in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which passed with overwhelming support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some critics have misstated the effect of <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>. Let me be clear that this bill, like all legislation impacting tribal governments, concerns U.S. policy toward and relationship with the nation's sovereign, indigenous peoples and is not race-based legislation. The unique legal and political relationship that indigenous Hawaiians have with the United States is like that of all Native Americans and is based on our status as aboriginal people with pre-existing governments with whom the U.S. entered  treaties and other agreements. It is this historical, political reality that provides the foundation for the unique relationship that has always existed--and continues to exist today--between the United States and the indigenous people whose homelands fall within the borders of what is now the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument that recognition of a Native Hawaiian governing entity would establish a race-based government is antithetical to the very foundation of the United States government's relationship with the indigenous peoples who have inhabited this land from time immemorial--a relationship that has long been recognized by Congress, the federal courts, and the Executive branch. Those making this argument are suggesting that Native Hawaiians should, and indeed must, be treated differently from the  other indigenous peoples residing in what is now the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act would establish parity for Native Hawaiians with the other indigenous peoples of America. To invoke the equal protection or due process clauses of the Constitution in this context, as some of the legislation's critics attempt to do, is a perversion of what those clauses were intended to do. Those submitting this argument are using the very cornerstones of justice and fairness in our democracy to deny equal treatment to one group of indigenous  people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act is consistent with this country's longstanding commitment to preserving the right of indigenous people to continue to exist as peoples. Passage of the bill is a matter of fundamental fairness and will rectify an injustice that has existed for far too long. Its enactment will set Native Hawaiians on the path toward self-determination and self-governance, as is their inherent right. I urge you to support <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>. Please contact myself or Virginia  Davis, vdavis@ncai.org or 202-466-7767 with any questions. As always, I thank you for your leadership on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe Garcia,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Congress of American Indians: Resolution #PHX-03-004</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States, to enlighten the public toward a  better understanding of the Indian people and their way of life, to preserve Indian cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit the following resolution; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the federal policy affords all Native Americans and Alaska Natives the right to be self-governing within a defined land base; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, there is a need for self-government; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the NCAI at its 56th annual session adopted Resolution #99-042, at its 57th annual session adopted Resolution #00-032 and at it 58th annual session adopted Resolution #SPO-01-087, all of which support the sovereign rights of native Hawaiians and recognizes the need to develop a true government-to-government relationship with the Hawaiian nation; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, NCAI also adopted the same resolution that the Hawaiian Nation's goal is federal recognition as a sovereign indigenous nation with inherent rights to self-determination and self-governance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now therefore be it resolved, that the NCAI does hereby support federal legislation calling for recognition of the Hawaiian nation, a self-determined entity created by and for native Hawaiians and their descendants in furtherance of a true government-to-government relationship; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be it further resolved, that the NCAI further supports the return of land to the Hawaiian Nation; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be it further resolved, that this resolution shall be the policy of the NCAI until it is withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution; and that a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the Hawaii state legislature, the Governor of the state of Hawaii, the Hawaii congressional delegation, the Congress of the United States of America, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of State, the President of the United States and the  Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be it finally resolved, that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI until it is withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foregoing resolution was adopted at the 2003 Mid-Year Session of the National Congress of American Indians, held at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Gila River Indian Community, in Phoenix, Arizona on June 18, 2003 with a quorum present.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Adopted by the General Assembly during the 2003 Mid-Year Session of the National Congress of American Indians, held at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Gila River Indian Community, in Phoenix, Arizona on June 18, 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Honolulu, Hawaii, October 23, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND HOUSE MINORITY LEADER BOEHNER: I am writing to you to express my very strong and unqualified support for the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>, often referred to as the "Akaka Bill." Enactment of this important bill is just and fair and will help to preserve the language, identity, and culture of Native Hawaiians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that the bill will likely be considered this week on the House floor, as this bill has the bipartisan support of almost every elected official in Hawaii, the strong support of Hawaii's business community, and most importantly, the strong support of Hawaii's people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill> would afford Native Hawaiians a long overdue measure of justice by providing them with the means to reorganize a formal self-governing entity. That entity would allow them to regain a portion of the self-determination taken from them over a century ago. This country's other native peoples, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, have been allowed to exercise some form of self-governance for decades. Native Hawaiians, therefore, are not asking for "preferential" status, but rather  the same treatment all other of America's native peoples have received.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill does not create "racial" distinctions, but rather affords participation in the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity to those who are descendants of the indigenous people of the Hawaiian Islands, a criterion Congress has long characterized as being non-racial. Indeed, Congress has already recognized Native Hawaiians to a large degree, by repeatedly singling out Native Hawaiians for special treatment, by acknowledging a "special relationship" with Native Hawaiians, and by stating that</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill> is surely constitutional, as the United States Supreme Court has consistently upheld the special status of indigenous peoples and defers to Congress's near plenary authority to decide which native peoples to recognize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I began this letter by stating my unqualified support for <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>. I conclude by respectfully asking for you to support this important measure as well. I thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda Lingle,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the American Bar Association, I urge your support for the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>, introduced by Representative Neil Abercrombie (D-HI).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ABA, as the national voice of the legal profession, has a long standing interest in the legal issues concerning America's native and indigenous peoples. Over the past twenty years, our House of Delegates has adopted numerous policies supporting self-determination and self-governance for American Indians and Alaska Natives. In 2006, we adopted policy supporting the right of Native Hawaiians to seek federal recognition of a native governing entity within the United States similar to that which  American Indians and Alaska Natives possess under the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ABA supports <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>. It is a conservative measure drafted to provide an ordered process that would lead to renewed self-determination for the Native Hawaiians. The goal is the creation of a political entity within U.S. borders developed by the indigenous Hawaiian people to serve, maintain and support their unique cultural and civic needs, including advocacy on their behalf on the federal and state level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would represent a return to self-determination for the Hawaiian people and a renewal of federal support for their unique history. For 1,000 years prior to the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, the people who we now know as the Native Hawaiians lived under an organized political framework governed by the rule of law. This kingdom had a written constitution and was recognized by the U.S. Government as a sovereign nation. Congress ratified treaty agreements with it and recognized its representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1893, U.S. agents acting without official sanction orchestrated a coup against this sovereign state and overthrew Hawaii's last queen. Acknowledging this crime and the continuing effect it had on Queen Liliuokalani's subjects, Congress  chose to intercede by taking a managerial posture towards the kingdom's assets and accepting a fiduciary duty to the Native Hawaiians and their progeny. This was the beginning of a unique relationship between Congress and the Hawaiian people. In 1993, the destruction of the Hawaiian nation's last government was acknowledged with regret in U.S. law (Public Law 103-150, also known as the Apology Resolution). <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill> would allow the Hawaiian people the right to govern their own destiny by replacing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of this legislation claim that allowing Native Hawaiians the right to self governance would imperil the constitutional rights of non-Native Hawaiians to equal protection under the law. They point to the former Kingdom's wealth and claim that self-determination will create a system of benefits disadvantaging those who are not of Native Hawaiian heritage. However, Native Hawaiians, in seeking rights and privileges that other indigenous people of the United States enjoy under our system  of law, are not compromising the rights of others but exercising their own rights to property, to self-determination and to be recognized as an indigenous people by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The right of Native Hawaiians to use of the property held in trust for them and the right to govern those assets is not in conflict with the Equal Protection Clause since it rests on independent constitutional authority regarding the rights of native nations contained within the text of Articles I and II of the Constitution. The constitutional framers recognized the existence of native nations within the United States that predated our own democracy and created a system for federal recognition  of indigenous nations within our then expanding borders. The framers empowered Congress through the Indian Commerce Clause and the Treaty Clause to maintain relations between the U.S. federal government and the governments of these native nations. Our courts have upheld Congress' power to recognize indigenous nations and have specifically</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to support the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination by voting for <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill> and against any weakening amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to my friend, the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this act. Having great familiarity with the peoples of the Hawaiian Islands and with Native Hawaiians, I understand their concerns that we should have codified a stronger statement of what their rights are as indigenous peoples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is really about making sure that language and culture and history are preserved. It also is consistent with the law which created the admission of Hawaii to this Union. I think the date, Mr. Abercrombie could correct me if I am wrong, it was August 21, 1959. That was an important date for this Nation, because it is a day that we embraced not only Hawaii but Alaska. It was a day that we embraced the potential of this country to extend its reach and embrace peoples of many different  cultures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act is an act that needs to be passed so that we can keep unfolding the real purpose and quality of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve my time,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased at this time to yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), the sponsor who has labored with this legislation actively in several Congresses, who is from the Committee on Natural Resources, and the author of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400001" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as this is a discussion on the rule and not necessarily on the bill itself, I would like to confine my remarks, at least in this initial phase of dealing with the issue, on some of the points raised by my good friend and colleague Mr. Hastings. I am appreciative of the points that he raised, because I think they are in need of not so much refutation but perhaps clarification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is easy to understand why those who are not necessarily familiar, and I am not speaking about Mr. Hastings personally, I am talking about the references that he cited in his commentary, it is easy to understand why people who are not familiar with a little bit of the history of Hawaii could come to some of the conclusions or make some of the observations that they have. Absent the context within which this bill is coming forward, it is understandable. That context then is what I want  to establish, so that it becomes clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly don't want to get in an argument with the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal either, and they are making some quotations there about complete territorial independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I think what is being referred to there, and what the likelihood of the reference is, is that there was in fact not territorial in the sense of annexation of territory, like the Philippines or Hawaii or Puerto Rico or that kind of thing that occurred during the kind of "imperial phase" of the United States, but there was in fact territorial independence, because Hawaii was a kingdom. It is one of the things that kind of gets lost in the shuffle, and that is one of the reasons we are here  today, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States of America has in fact had, over a 175-year period leading up to the overthrow of the kingdom in 1893, a series of treaties and conventions; 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, 1887, dealing with commerce, dealing with trade, dealing with various recognitions. The Kingdom of Hawaii had treaties and conventions with other nations, as well as the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a result of that history, we have a succession of land claims and assets that have come from the time of the kingdom to the shotgun republic that occurred after the overthrow of the kingdom and the annexation of the United States into the territory, and into finally becoming a State, as was indicated, in 1959. We are in fact the last State to enter the Union, along with Alaska in 1959.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I bring this up simply to point out that far from subdividing the American people, as was cited by my good friend, quite the contrary; it incorporates the politics as well as the historical reality of this land secession and the assets associated with it, because this land generates income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basically what this is about, Mr. Speaker, is land and other assets, including money, and who controls it. When this land came in, it wasn't worth anything. The Wall Street Journal did not comment, I am certain, on the ceded lands. They are called "ceded lands" because they were ceded from the kingdom to the succeeding governmental entities. They could care less,  the Wall Street Journal, about these lands when they were worth nothing, when they were  not seen to be able to be marketed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me explain now, and I ask my good friend as I look at him now with a smile on my face, we are talking about land in Hawaii? You are talking big bucks. You are talking money here. That is what this is about is land and money and who controls it. And this land has, from the time of the kingdom, resided with the Native Hawaiians. That is who is to be the beneficiary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That takes me to the point, Mr. Speaker, of the entry into the Union. The Admissions Act requires us, requires us, the Admissions Act of 1959 requires us to utilize those lands and assets for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. That is in the Admissions Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We are not here on the floor today because we didn't have anything better to do in Hawaii than to try to bring this to the Federal Government. On the contrary, the Admissions Act requires us to make certain that these lands are utilized for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. The reason we have the bill here is that in order to accomplish that, we need to get a governing entity that can come to the Department of the Interior for approval in order to be able to conduct the affairs, similarly to,  parallel to what now happens with Native Americans in the so-called lower 48 in the mainland of the United States and with various Alaska Natives and corporations and other entities that have been set up in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a history of indigenous people. They are different from other indigenous people because they were a kingdom, and we would not have the 2 million acres we are talking about had those acres not been associated with an indigenous people. They are not imaginary, they are real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me say with Rice v. Cayetano, Governor Cayetano, the first Filipino American to be elected Governor, that issue was settled on a question of voting procedures and had nothing whatsoever to do with programs for Native Hawaiians.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate my friend from Hawaii's clarification on this, and I just want to point out a couple of things in my opening remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I emphasized that this is a process which I think acknowledges the fact that there is a history that goes back to when Hawaii was a kingdom, and so I acknowledge that point. But I simply raise those issues because those issues I think are important when we talk about the United States as a whole, as a government under laws and everybody being treated equal, and these are questions that I think need to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate very, very much my friend's clarification on this. The point that this is a process and the point that there is some lineage going back from a State to a territory to a kingdom probably has some viability to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are always unintended laws when we write national laws that appeal to one State or one set of people. That is what we have to be cautious about. That is why I simply raise these concerns. The issue is before us. We have a rule and we have made in order an amendment that deals with the 14th amendment. I think that is important to be discussed, and I doubt if this issue will be completely decided here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>I am the last speaker, and I will reserve my time until the gentleman closes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so that I may amend the rule to have Speaker Pelosi, in consultation with Republican Leader BOEHNER, immediately appoint conferees to <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two days ago a number of news publications, including Roll Call, reported that the Democrat leadership intends to play political games and hold off on sending any appropriations bills to President Bush so that they can use an upcoming anticipated veto of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to serve as "an extension of their successful public relations campaign on the State Children's Health Insurance Program." Roll Call is the one that made that observation on October 22, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the House Democrat leadership plays politics on this issue, however, our Nation's veterans are paying the price. The Senate has already done its work and appointed conferees for this bill. And for every day that House Democrats allow the veterans funding bill to languish without conferees for their only political advantage, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million, money that could be used for veterans housing, veterans health care, and other important veterans support activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 18, American Legion National Commander Marty Conaster, five national vice commanders and all 55 Legion national executive committee members sent Speaker Pelosi a letter pleading with her to put partisanship aside and provide this funding for the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include a copy of the letter for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>THE AMERICAN LEGION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indianapolis, IN, October 18, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: Today ends the Fall meeting of The American Legion's National Executive Committee, at The American Legion's National Headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. The National Executive Committee consists of an elected leader from each of The American Legion's 55 Departments (50 States, the District of Columbia and four foreign countries). In accordance with The American Legion's National Constitution and By-laws, the National Executive Committee serves as The American Legion's  governing body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Commander Marty Conatser briefed The National Executive Committee on an array of issues to include the status of the VA budget for FY 2008. The fiscal activities of the 110th Congress--the FY 2007 Continuing Resolution, the Budget Resolution for FY 2008, and the passage of the Military Construction, Veterans' Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations for FY 2008 were reviewed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in trying to grasp why such a bipartisan bill, which passed overwhelmingly in both chambers, still hasn't moved in over a month is rather difficult, especially since the President has already said he would not veto the bill, even though it exceeds his recommendations. Understanding why the appropriations process has come to a complete halt is difficult. What is preventing the appointment of conferees, the Conference Committee, or passage of a Conference Report?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now in the new fiscal year with no idea when the Mil Con-VA appropriations will be passed. If history repeats itself, this standoff may last well into the second quarter of the fiscal year. This uncertainty is disturbing to not only The American Legion and other veterans' and military service organizations, but to every veteran who is dependent on VA for timely access to quality health care, earned benefits, and other services provided by a grateful nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the newest generation of wartime veterans are reporting to VA medical facilities every day as troops are returning from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Some will be determined to be service-connected disabled because of medical conditions incurred or aggravated while on active-duty. Others may very well have invisible scars that need attention as soon as possible. As VA welcomes new patients, the existing patient population cannot be ignored nor should their health care be  rationed due to limited available resources. There are veterans dependent on VA as their life-support system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Legion represents 2.6 million wartime veterans, but also speaks for the 24 million veterans of the United States Armed Forces and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please continue the appropriations process--name conferees, convene the Conference Committee, and pass the Conference Report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that same day, the commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, General Lisicki, also urged Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat leadership to put partisanship aside for the benefit of our Nation's veterans and troops. These pleas from the American Legion and the VFW fall on the heels of multiple requests from Republican Members of this House to both Speaker Pelosi and Democrat Majority Leader Senator Reid, urging them to end their PR campaign and  begin conference work on the Veterans appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, it appears as though all of these commonsense requests have fallen on deaf ears and our Nation's veterans are being forced to pay the price for continued Democrat partisanship and lack of leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record these two letters so everyone watching today's debate across the country can see the efforts that have been made by the Republican Party to end this impasse on the important issue of providing adequate funding for those who have sacrificed so much on behalf of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, September 17, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MADAM SPEAKER: We write to urge you in the strongest possible terms to reach a prompt agreement on the conference report on the FY2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act (<bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>). Few issues are more important than adequate funding for our Nation's veterans. The leadership in the House cannot allow this critically important funding to fall victim to the usual partisan wrangling which occurs all too often in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans should not be used as tools for political bargaining and gamesmanship. Both the House and Senate passed the FY08 MilCon-Veterans appropriations with overwhelming majorities because our commitment to veterans rises above partisan squabbling. Tragedies such as the recent revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center must never be repeated. The findings of insufficient care at Walter Reed and other facilities should be seen by Congress as a mandate to finish the work and live up to the  promises we have made to our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After decades of flat funding, total VA budget rose from $48 billion in FY 2001 to approximately $70 billion in FY 2006, a 46 percent increase. This year, the House voted to increase funding by $6 billion over FY07, one of the largest in the 77 year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Both the Senate and House versions received overwhelming majority support passing by a vote of 409-2 in the House and 92-1 in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier in the year, the new Majority agreed they would continue the trend of significant increases in veterans funding begun by the Republican Congress. We ask you to honor that agreement and see that the commitment we made to our veterans is honored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must never forget the sacrifice of our veterans. As members of Congress, we have a solemn obligation to fulfill our promises to them. We ask for you to look past the heightened partisanship of our times and unite us on this issue by making it a first priority to quickly bring a stand alone Veterans appropriations bill through conference so the Congress may present the President with a bill by October 1, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We stand ready to assist you in reaching this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 4, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MAJORITY LEADER REID: We write today to ask you to keep the Senate in session the week of October 8, to help pass this years' veterans appropriations. Now that we are already into the new fiscal year, it is imperative that the House and Senate reach a prompt agreement on the conference report on the FY2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act (<bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate the Senate has been unable to act upon many of its Constitutionally mandated appropriations bills. While the House continues to wait upon the Senate to complete its work, we call upon you to quickly move veterans appropriations through conference so a final version of the bill may be passed and presented to the President. We believe that veterans issues rise above the partisan divisions of Washington which is evident by the passage of the FY08 MilCon-Veterans appropriations  with overwhelming majorities in both Houses, 501-3 combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate cannot allow this critically important funding to continue to fall victim to the usual partisan wrangling which occurs all too often in Washington. If tragedies such as the recent revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are to be diverted in the future, we must pass veterans funding now. From FY 2001 the total VA budget rose from $48 billion to approximately $70 billion in FY 2006, a 46 percent increase. This year, the House voted to increase funding by $6 billion dollars over  FY07, one of the largest in the 77 year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Because we have asked so much of our brave men and women in uniform during the War on Terror we must uphold our commitment to veterans upon their return home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier in the year, the new Majority agreed they would continue the trend of significant increases in veterans funding begun by the Republican Congress. We ask you to honor that agreement and see the commitment we made to our veterans is upheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must never forget the sacrifice of our veterans. As members of Congress, we have a solemn obligation to fulfill our promises to them. We ask you to look past the heightened partisanship of our times and unite us on this issue by making it a first priority to bring a stand-alone veterans appropriations bill through conference so the Congress may present the President with a bill no later than October 12, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all of my colleagues to vote against the previous question so we can put partisanship aside and move this important legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material appear in the Record just prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="CERTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is about the right to live. It is about empowering Native Hawaiians to own their destiny and choose how to manage their livelihood. This bill is not about gaming. In fact, it expressly is prohibited in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the bill is about providing an opportunity to effectively reorganize the Native Hawaiian government to better meet the needs of Native Hawaiians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying legislation enjoys the support of Hawaii's Republican Governor Linda Lingle, the business community in Hawaii, the National Congress of American Indians, the Alaska Federation of Natives, and Hawaii's entire congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act has received immense bipartisan support year after year. It is now time that we fulfill the duty of this Congress and serve Native Hawaiians just as they have served and contributed to the vibrant and diverse culture that is America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the rule, the previous question, and on final passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings of Washington is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="764">H. Res. 764</bill> Offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SEC. 3. The House disagrees to the Senate amendment to the bill, <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, and agrees to the conference requested by the Senate thereon. The Speaker shall appoint conferees immediately, but may declare a recess under clause 12(a) of rule I for the purpose of consulting the Minority Leader prior to such appointment.  The motion to instruct conferees otherwise in order pending the appointment of conferees instead shall be in order only at a time designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days after adoption of this resolution.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <narrative>(The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)</narrative>
  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution--[and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules Committee  described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
