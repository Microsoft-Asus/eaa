    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2004, we spent $103 billion buying oil from nondemocratic countries, countries such as Iran, Venezuela and Russia, and the list goes on and on. Indeed, we are funding both sides in the war on terrorism, because every time we send money to these folks, the money winds up in the hands of somebody, some group, who doesn't stand for what we stand for and often is overtly anti-American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why we should pass the DRIVE Act, which I have co-sponsored with Democrat Congressman ELIOT ENGEL. The DRIVE Act seeks to reduce our oil consumption by 20 percent, which is roughly the amount of oil we buy from the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do this through tax incentives, putting people in hybrids and flex-fuel vehicles, getting gas stations to convert to flex-fuel stations so that they can sell ethanol and biodiesel and giving a tax incentive for automobile manufacturers so that they can work with lightweight material to make cars more fuel efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please co-sponsor the DRIVE Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
