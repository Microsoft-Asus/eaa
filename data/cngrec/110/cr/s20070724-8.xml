    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to say a brief word about a couple of matters. As we heard in the prayer offered by Admiral Black, some will remember that day 9 years ago when these two officers were killed. I remember it for a number of reasons, not the least of which, when I attended law school, I went to law school during the daytime and worked a full-time swing shift, a night shift, as a Capitol police officer. My service as a Capitol policeman was not one where I showed any bravery or courage  or any valor; I was directing traffic much of the time. That was the most dangerous job I did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But 9 years ago today, two police officers did exemplify courage and valor. These two Capitol police officers, Special Agent Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, were stationed by the east entrance on the House side. At 3:40 in the afternoon, a man with a gun tried  to force his way past them. When Officer Chestnut blocked his path, the gunman shot him point-blank in the chest and killed him. Special Agent Gibson then warned nearby tourists and staff to  seek cover. In fact, he chased the gunman down the hallway. He was headed for the House leadership's office. When they exchanged gunfire, one tourist was hit. Officer Gibson was also hit and died from his wounds, as did Officer Chestnut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A plaque has been placed in the Capitol Building where the confrontation took place, and their names are carved in the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial recognizing their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew Officer Gibson. Senate Democrats had a retreat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During that retreat, my wife became very ill one night. Special Agent Gibson was the first one there. He was carrying all the resuscitation equipment. He was sweating. He had run from the office where the police were stationed to take care of my wife. I remember how kind, thoughtful, and considerate he was, and how gentle he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't know Officer Chestnut other than exchanging greetings when I met him, but his reputation was outstanding, and his actions that day proved his enormous strength of character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of the brave police officers who protect me every day, Mr. President, with the skill and hard work I see firsthand each day. I also think of all the law enforcement men and women who keep this building and those who serve within it safe. We should all be grateful, but I am grateful beyond words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on this somber anniversary, I will lay a wreath and observe a moment of silence for these two heroic men we lost. Our hearts, and certainly our thoughts, are with the families of Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut. I have met their families on a number of occasions. We hope that remembering them is some comfort to them that the sacrifice of their loved ones will be forever remembered with our gratitude and utmost respect.</paragraph>
