  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, consistent with the unanimous consent agreement, we will be talking about an amendment that was discussed last night. Senator Cornyn had some language changes to the amendment that have now been adopted. I believe it makes it a much stronger, better amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do here is add $3 billion to go toward securing the border, and I believe that is a homeland security event. So it is certainly an amount of money that is large in nature but goes to something that is large in nature in terms of our national security needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of Senator Voinovich and his concerns about spending--I admire him greatly. He has been a constant, serious, thoughtful voice about controlling spending. This is an emergency designation, which means it is an off-budget item. I think Senator Voinovich has every right in the world to be concerned about how the Congress is spending money in a way for the next  generation to pick up the bill, but I would argue there is a time  for emergencies in business life and personal life and legislative life, and this is one of those times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an emergency kind of manufactured by Washington. It is something that should have been done 20 years ago. Now we have taken up immigration in a serious way. We had an extensive debate not long ago, and we were not able to get comprehensive immigration reform, but I think most Americans believe losing operational control of the U.S.-Mexican border is a national security issue of a serious nature, and they applaud our efforts to put money into securing the border between the United States  and Mexico. That is exactly what this amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there were ever a legitimate emergency in this country, I think this would be one of those times because we have lost control of our border. In the age of terrorism, what does it mean for a nation like the United States, which is being pursued by a vicious enemy that knows no boundaries, to lose control of its border?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It means that you are opening yourself up to attack. Now, most of the people who come across the border come here to work. This amendment does not deal with that. Hopefully, it will slow down how you get into the country. Hopefully, it will control who comes into the country--people coming to work illegally or people coming across the border to do us harm, it would make it more difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the idea of employment and the magnet of employment is not addressed by this amendment. We need a temporary worker program. We need employer verification systems so people cannot come here and fraudulently get jobs. That is not dealt with in this amendment. But this amendment is a great first step to controlling people coming across our border and overstaying their visas. I think it is a step that will get a large bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does it do? The $3 billion in emergency spending will allow us to hire 23,000 Border Patrol agents to go report for duty; more boots on the ground, more people patrolling our border making it harder for somebody to come across illegally. We should have done this a long time ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment allows the hiring of a substantially larger number of Border Patrol agents, four unmanned aerial vehicles that will allow us to patrol isolated areas of the border by having new technology in place--the unmanned aerial vehicle has been a very effective tool in controlling illegal border crossings--one hundred and five ground-based radar and camera towers. We need walls along the border in urban areas where you can walk across the street, but technology in the desert and other areas  of the border has proven to be a good investment. This amendment seriously increases the amount of technology to detect illegal border crossings; 300 miles of vehicle barriers, where people can drive up and down the border with vehicle lanes, where the Border Patrol can patrol that area in question and make it a more effective policing regime; 700 miles of border fence. We have approved</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the catch-and-release program, where you catch someone, turn them loose, and they come right back, well, we are trying to deal with that problem by increasing detention beds to 45,000, so when we catch someone, we can detain them and deport them--without them never showing up to their hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cornyn addition will allow this $3 billion to be used in interior enforcement in a way to go after people who have absconded, who have been deported, who have been issued orders but have left and they are on the run. We can track them down and bring them to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, this amendment is money well spent. I am sorry it has to be spent in an emergency fashion, but it is an emergency. The reason this is an emergency, we have let it get out of hand. The goal of this amendment is operational control of the U.S.-Mexican border.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to Senator  Graham for his strong leadership on this issue. I know Senator Pryor, on the other side of the aisle, is the principal Democratic cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I concur with what Senator Graham said. The necessity for this particular amendment is occasioned by the neglect of the Federal Government over the last 20 years at meeting its commitment to do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has become, of course, a national focus in a post-9/11 world, when we have to know who is coming across our borders and what their intentions are. We cannot any longer assume people are coming across for benign reasons or are simply economic migrants because we know the same broken borders that allow a person to come across who wants to work in the United States can be exploited by human smugglers or drug traffickers and potentially even those who want to come here and commit acts of terrorism  in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I made a part of the Congressional Record, by unanimous consent, the first of a four-part article written in the San Antonio Express News, documenting the movement of what are called special interest aliens; that is, individuals who are coming to America, from countries where terrorism is flourishing, through our broken southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The particular story that is documented talks about a young Iraqi who traveled from Damascus, Syria, to Moscow, to Havana and then to Guatemala and then up through the southern border, our southern border with Mexico, into the United States. Thank goodness this individual did not appear to be committed to a life of terrorism, but it demonstrates the kind of vulnerability we have in this country, and it is important we do everything possible to protect it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased with the majority leader's agreement to now allow us to include the use of these funds for interior enforcement because we know 45 percent of the illegal immigration in this country occurs not from people who violate the border but people who enter legally, then overstay and then go underground. So I am grateful to the majority leader and am pleased to support this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="TITLE X--BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to speak about amendment No. 2480, the Graham-Pryor amendment. Let me first say the legislation Senator Graham and Senator Pryor have brought to the floor this morning, in terms of an amendment, is essentially the same language and has the same legislative provisions we had in the comprehensive immigration reform package. They are good aspects of that legislation that allow us to move forward with securing and fixing  our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we went through the immigration reform debate, we said we had to do three things: First, we needed to enforce and fix our borders; secondly, we needed to enforce our laws within our country; and, thirdly, we needed to figure out a realistic solution to the reality that we have 12 million undocumented workers who are here in this country today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment takes a part of those principal components and addresses it in a very effective way. Indeed, when you look through the language, what it does is it says we will hire 23,000 additional Border Patrol agents; we will have 4 unmanned aerial vehicles and 105 ground-based radar and camera towers; we will have 300 miles of vehicle barriers and 700 miles of fence; we will have a permanent end to the catch-and-release policy and additional funding to enhance employment verification; we  will have increased removal and detention of visa overstays and reimbursement to State and local governments for immigration expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that all is good. It addresses one of the fundamental components of immigration reform. So I am supportive of what we are trying to do here. I do wish to let my good friend and colleague, Senator Graham, and my good friend, Senator Pryor, know that the concern I have with the amendment, notwithstanding the fact that I will support it, is that it is all focused on the southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it may be, and it is true our borders are broken, it is not just the border between Mexico and the United States that is broken. We have the same kinds of problems in our ports, we have the same kinds of problems along our northern border. This is, frankly, unfair in terms of focusing only on the Mexican border. We have to fix all our borders, not just the Mexican border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while I will be supporting this amendment, I also intend to offer another amendment that will address the other broken borders we have in our country because I think that is a way to be fair about it. It is the only way in which we will ultimately achieve the objective we have, which is dealing with the national security of the United States of America. You cannot have national security when you have broken borders.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Arkansas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="TITLE X--BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very pleased that Senator Graham and others have come together to increase and enhance our border security in this country. We all know in this Chamber we have tried very hard to reform our immigration system that we have on the books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I have been very vocal saying I am for immigration reform. I think we need to do that. But so far we have not been able to get that done in the Senate. I believe, honestly, we need more involvement with the White House in trying to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But regardless of that, today one of the things that came through to me loudly and clearly from the people in Arkansas is we need to secure our border. People do not want to wait 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, whatever it may be, to have border security; they want us to start working on that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we are trying to accomplish with this amendment today. Again, I am very pleased that Senator Graham, a true South Carolina conservative Member of this body, someone whom we all respect, someone who, even though he has impeccable conservative and Republican credentials, is willing to reach across the aisle to work with others to try to get good things done for his State and for our country. He and Senator Cornyn of Texas and many others have worked on this issue.  I am very pleased to be part of a bipartisan solution on border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I like about this legislation is it adds $3 billion for border security. That means we will get 23,000 additional full-time border agents, we will get new border-monitoring technology, we will get 300 miles of vehicle barriers, we will get 700 miles of fence. That is funded by this amendment. We will get 105 radar and camera towers, and we will get resources to detain an additional 45,000 illegal immigrations who are in this country right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also includes money to help with some internal matters in this country, to help do some processing and look at employee issues and employer issues, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good amendment. I think one of the things I heard loudly and clearly from the immigration debates we had on the Senate floor was people in Arkansas want us to secure the border first, let's enforce the laws we have on the books. They have been on the books for a long time, and we have not done a very good job of enforcing those laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I say "we," I mean the administration. The will to try to enforce the laws we have on the books has not been there. I am not trying to point fingers. It is not only this administration; we can go back for a couple of decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regardless of that, I am not trying to point fingers. Right now I want to look forward. I want to add to this amendment an additional $3 billion for border enforcement to enhance this Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to look at this, give it very strong consideration, and support this amendment. It is bipartisan. We have a number of Senators who were on it originally, a number more have been added as we go today. So I would, in closing, recommend to my colleagues that they give this very strong consideration. It will allow us to enforce the laws we have on the books, it allows us to enhance our border security in very real and very meaningful ways. I think it is what the American  public wants.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak on the border security amendment No. 2480. As the immigration bill came to a close, there was one thing that was very clear--there was unanimity and support for the issue of border security. The issue of protecting our border is one we all understand. The American people understand. It needs to be done. That was one of the many things that was in that bill that was undone that needed doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe today we do a great thing by moving this issue forward. We have a great threat of terrorism, the continued flow of illegal immigrants. We need to do all we can to secure our border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will provide an increase in resources to improve our security by building our physical presence and surveillance on the border itself. It requires within 2 years of enactment that we secure operational control over the southern border between the United States and Mexico, and it allows the Border Patrol and U.S. Customs to hire and train and report for duty 23,000 full-time agents. I believe this is a step in the right direction. The United States, in addition to that, will deploy  four unmanned aerial vehicles. These are essential for electronic surveillance in order to fully protect our southern border. In addition, the U.S. shall engage in the catch and return of illegal aliens. We know that a great many of those who are here illegally have simply overstayed their visas. This also permits interior enforcement in order to be able to be successful in implementing strong border and interior enforcement. Ninety days from enactment of this bill and every 90 days thereafter, the administration shall report to Congress on the progress. If the progress isn't on track, the report will include specific recommendations for fixing the problem. That is essential because for too</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Giving the American people the security and understanding that the Government is serious about border enforcement and about interior security, we then will be able to move forward with phases of the immigration reform act that did not come to pass. There was a lack of credibility that our Government has with the people with respect to our seriousness of purpose in border enforcement. This amendment is a step forward. We are putting the dollars that it needs, in addition to the specific direction  it ought to have, as well to ensure that we will have the kind of border security all Americans expect and want so that we can then move forward with the other phases of immigration reform that are so desperately needed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="TITLE X--BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate yesterday attempted to add $3 billion in emergency spending to secure our borders. I supported that effort. Unfortunately, rather than voting on the substance of the amendment, it was necessary for the Senate to vote on a procedural matter. In order to provide for the orderly processing of appropriations bills in the Senate, it was essential to vote to sustain the ruling of the Chair under rule XVI. However, I still believe it is important that we not miss this opportunity  to provide robust funding to secure our borders and to enforce our immigration law. Therefore, I support the amendment providing $3 billion--that is $3 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--get that, hear me, $3 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--in emergency spending</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This $3 billion will not be encumbered by controversial legislative and policy issues. Instead, it will be used in support of already authorized activities such as hiring Border Patrol agents, building fencing and other border technology, and enforcing the immigration laws already on the books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this amendment will hire, train, and equip at least 5,000 new Border Patrol agents, in addition to the 3,000 new agents funded in the underlying bill. It will procure more than 4,000 additional detention beds, in addition to the 4,000 new beds funded in the underlying bill. It will hire more than 1,000 new immigration investigators and detention and removal personnel to perform interior enforcement activities such as expanding the work site enforcement investigation. It will increase  the number of Criminal Alien Program and Fugitive Operations teams to locate and remove the over 630,000 fugitive alien absconders whom a judge has already ordered to be removed. It provides an additional $1 billion for border fencing, infrastructure, and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it provides funds to procure additional helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, marine vessels, and other border surveillance equipment, as well as funds to construct additional border stations in which our Border Patrol agents work. This amendment is balanced, and it is focused on meeting the immediate border security needs while enforcing our current immigration law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on my left and my colleagues on my right to support the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all Senators, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand Senator Sessions wishes to speak. He is on the way. As soon as he gets here, we will gladly yield back any time that is remaining. I wish to make a couple comments about the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 1, in terms of spending, it is one of those situations where the country finds itself in an emergency that maybe shouldn't have been an emergency to begin with because we have neglected our border security obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Specter, Coleman, and Lincoln as cosponsors of the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="TITLE X--BORDER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS">
    <paragraph>We are where we are as a nation. We have a porous border. Every time a supplemental bill comes through on Iraq, it gets the votes from this body that it needs to become law, because all of us understand, whether we disagree with the policies in Iraq, that once the soldiers and warfighters are there, our troops are there, there are certain things that have to flow from their presence, and we designate a lot of money for the Iraqi operation as emergency spending; I believe rightfully  so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I would argue to anybody, Republican or Democrat, that one of the big chinks in our national security armor is a porous border between the United States and Mexico, and this $3 billion will really help in a serious way. It is serious money to deal with a serious problem that is truly an emergency. It will add more boots on the  ground. It will add agents for there to be a total of 23,000 border security agents on the border, which is a tremendous  increase over what we have now. I think it is like 13,000 or 14,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the technology in this bill will be a force multiplier. The technology we spend money to secure will allow the force in place to be multiplied by a factor of many because the technology literally leverages the boots on the ground in a tremendous way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 45,000 additional bedspaces will stop a program that is really the wrong message to send--catch and release: We catch you. We release you back. You come again. Now we have bedspace to detain people to make sure they do not flee, and they are deported for coming across the borders illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an effort to basically deal with a problem that has been a long time in the making. There is money that will have a beneficial consequence to securing our borders. The term "operational control" is a military term. I look at this effort to secure our borders in many ways as a military operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this amendment gets a strong bipartisan vote. I understand Senator Voinovich's concern about the emergency designation in spending money offline, but this is one of those times I think it is justified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the administration, I understand your concerns about spending, but you have sent hundreds of millions of dollars in requests over--billions of dollars--to the Congress to make sure we have the money necessary to secure Iraq for our troops' point of view. Now it is time to spend $3 billion to secure our borders here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the body will understand this is a step forward. It does not solve the problem. We still have a magnet of employment that has to be dealt with. We need a temporary worker program. We need a lot of things this amendment does not cover. But this is a great start in providing operational security to a porous border that in the age of terrorism is really not only an emergency but a national disgrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the taxpayers at large will see this as a serious effort to do something about a problem which has huge consequences over time if left unaddressed. So I appreciate Senator Reid working with us and Senator Cornyn making it better and my good friend from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, for helping us move the ball down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill ever gets to conference, which I hope it will, I hope this provision is left standing as is because if there is a retreat from this, from the money, and from the designations in this amendment, I think it would be considered a retreat in terms of regaining operational control of our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, I believe Senator Pryor wishes to be recognized.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. This is an issue which has been with us for years now, an issue of border security which we simply, as a group of policymakers, have not addressed in the right way. That became pretty obvious during our debate on the immigration bill several weeks ago. All of us heard from our constituents back home that while overall immigration reform may be needed in due course, what we need  to do immediately is to take action to make sure our borders are, in fact, actually secure. That is the first step in real immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Isakson and I sent a letter to the administration imploring them to take action on this issue. We have asked the administration to send an emergency supplemental to the Senate and the House requesting that certain measures to secure our borders be enacted and adequately funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Senator Graham has done with this amendment is a step in the right direction toward ensuring that our borders--particularly our border to the south--are made secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a little bit disappointed we cannot go any further because what Senator Isakson and I have asked the administration to do in its supplemental request to this body would be to include the creation of a biometric identification card so all of those folks who cross the border in a legal way would have that identification card and any employer who sought to hire any of those individuals would know that they are here legally. If you hired them otherwise, it would be at your own peril.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some technical reasons why Senator Graham could not add that provision in here. It is going to require more money, No. 1, plus some other issues regarding the rules of this body. So I am hopeful that there are some additional measures we will take up after we, hopefully, adopt this amendment overwhelmingly, get this bill into conference, out of conference, and on the desk of the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I applaud my colleague from South Carolina, as well as Senator Pryor, who I know has worked very hard on this particular measure. This amendment does many of the things Senator Isakson and I have asked for, and we are very hopeful this will get to the desk of the President immediately. This will answer one of those questions a lot of us heard during the immigration debate from our constituents; that is, why don't you enforce the laws that are on the books today? Well, here  is the answer: We do not have the money to do it. This will give us the money to do some of those things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge all of my colleagues to look very favorably on this amendment. Let's take the first right step to secure the borders. Then we can come back and deal with the overall remaining immigration issues that are outstanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for reaching this understanding on how to proceed relative to making sure our borders are secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in this amendment, which adds a significant amount of money to support the expansion of the boots on the ground and the technology on the border, is critical to the  first step--which has been related here by a number of individuals--of securing the border as part of our effort to get comprehensive immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we all understand the American people are asking the question, Why isn't the border secure? This has been an effort that has been ongoing for a number of years now, to make the border secure. But this amendment we are taking up now would be the final downpayment on what is necessary to accomplish that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what we need in order to secure the border. It is more border agents, it is more physical fencing but a lot more virtual fencing, it is more detention beds, and it is more ICE agents. It is also necessary to have in place the law these individuals need in order to enforce the border and pursue people who come into this country illegally and who may be inappropriately here and who are committing crimes here. Unfortunately, that language was not included in this amendment. That language  was stripped out yesterday. But still, getting the resources in place in order to support the border is the first critical step, and this bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working on this issue for a long time, both as past chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and as past chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee in the Appropriations Committee, as have Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd. There has been a strong commitment on the part of the Appropriations Committee to accomplish these goals. But there has always been additional resources needed in order to fully fund border security.  Now, with this amendment, we will actually put in place those additional resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for bringing this process to closure. I congratulate the majority leader for reaching a consensus here that could be bipartisan. As Senator McConnell said last night, this is a positive, bipartisan effort to try to step forward on one of the most critical issues we have as a nation, which is making sure the people who come into this country come into the country legally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is the end of a long road, quite honestly, relative to the responsibility of Congress. We will now have put in place the necessary resources to secure the border. The question now becomes whether those resources will be effectively used. Certainly, we will have to use all our oversight capability to ensure that occurs, but at least we have addressed our responsibility of making sure the funds are there to support the necessary additional boots on the ground, the additional expansion of  security along the border in the form of virtual fencing and in the form of physical fencing, and the additional detention beds necessary to make sure that when someone is apprehended for coming into the country illegally, they are not simply set off on their own recognizance to appear in court someday but are actually restrained in a place so they can be returned back to the nation they came from in an orderly manner, which is critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a good bill and good language. I am glad we are making this progress on it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the requirements of fencing, additional Border Patrol agents, bedspaces for those who have been detained who come here illegally are not there as an end in themselves. Our goal--our real goal--must be to create a change in the mindset of what is happening at the border, to reach that tipping point in which the world knows our borders are not wide open, that it is exceedingly difficult to penetrate them illegally and they are unlikely to be successful. As a result,  we can move from the current situation--in which over a million people last year were arrested coming into our country illegally--and see those numbers drop off, to reach that tipping point, where the world knows that border is not open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked about it for all the 10 years since I have been in the Senate. Presidents have talked about it. They have campaigned on it. Members have talked about it. But we have not done anything about it. That is why the American people are not happy with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think this legislation will do some things of significance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will fund 700 miles at the border and complete that process. Why it has taken as long as it has I am not sure, but work is being done right now, although not a lot has been accomplished so far. I am told that pretty soon we will see the fencing come up that we have authorized and that the work is continuing on. So it will be 700 miles. That is really progress, I have to say, but it is not the final installment. We are going to have to do more in the years to come. It is actual fencing, plus  virtual fencing also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am pleased we have made a concrete step forward with this funding. It will allow us, if the executive branch uses it wisely, to transform in a significant way the open border system we now have to a lawful system. That would be good for America in terms of creating a lawful system of immigration, and it will be good for the people who send us their money and expect us to do what we promise to do and that we actually get serious about it and start taking steps in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to fencing, other countries use fencing significantly. Spain is constructing quite a lot of fencing on their African border. Other countries are doing so in the EU. Hong Kong has a border situation that they have dealt with through fencing. It is not anything unusual. It is the normal course when you have a wide open border because what happens is, a fence will multiply many times the effectiveness of a Border Patrol officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues how you would be able to control hundreds of miles of border if you are just standing out there by yourself. If the person trying to come in knows they have to cross a fence, they will have a much harder time and be much easier to apprehend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to pick up on some of the comments my colleagues on the Republican side have made on this amendment. One of the things Senator Sessions just mentioned is that this is a concrete proposal. I know he didn't intend the play on words, but this is concrete. We are talking about adding real border enforcement. It is real. It is bricks and mortar. It is physical barriers. It will definitely slow the influx of people coming into this country who are not  playing by the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans. We have been adding cosponsors this morning to this legislation. I want to thank all of my colleagues who participated. I need to give a special thanks to Senator Harry Reid who helped pull this amendment together. To put $3 billion on border enforcement on the Homeland Security appropriations makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense in terms of good government, and it makes perfect sense to the people all across  this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the messages I heard loudly and clearly during the immigration debate which we finished a few weeks ago is, people want more border enforcement. They want the U.S. Government to secure our border. There is no doubt about that; this is something the Federal Government has failed to do or has been pretty lax in trying to do over the last several years. Again, this didn't start with the Bush administration. I think it has probably gotten worse during this time, but it goes back several administrations.  I am not here to point fingers today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By voting for this amendment today, Senators would add 23,000 additional full-time border agents. We would add new border monitoring technology. We would add 300 miles of vehicle barriers, 700 miles of fence, 105 radar and camera towers. We would add resources to detain 45,000 illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is, as Senator Sessions said, a concrete step in the right direction. This is good public policy. I know we have broad bipartisan support for this legislation. I want to thank my colleagues for giving this strong consideration, and I ask that they look at this legislation before we vote in just a few minutes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee is issuing subpoenas to political operatives at the White House for documents and testimony related to the committee's ongoing investigation into the mass firings of U.S. attorneys and the politicization of hiring and firing within the Department of Justice. This is not a step I take lightly. For over 4 months I have exhausted every avenue seeking the voluntary cooperation of Karl Rove and J. Scott Jennings but to no avail. They and  the White House have stonewalled every request. Indeed, the White House is choosing to withhold documents and is instructing witnesses who are former officials--not current officials but former officials--to refuse to answer questions and provide relevant information and documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have now reached a point where accumulated evidence shows that political considerations factored into the unprecedented firing of at least nine U.S. attorneys last year. Testimony and documents show that the list was compiled based on input from the highest political ranks in the White House, including Mr. Rove and Mr. Jennings. And today I will subpoena Mr. Rove and Mr. Jennings. The evidence shows that senior officials were apparently focused on the political impact of Federal prosecutions  and whether Federal prosecutors were doing enough to bring partisan voter fraud and corruption cases. It is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a coverup and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that same effort. Just this week, during his sworn testimony, Mr. Gonzales contrasted these firings with the replacement of other U.S. attorneys for "legitimate cause."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House has asserted blanket claims of executive privilege, despite testimony under oath and on the record that the President was not involved. The White House refuses to provide a factual basis for its blanket claims. The White House has instructed former White House officials not to testify about what they know and instructed Harriet Miers to refuse even to appear as required by a House Judiciary Committee subpoena. The White House has withheld relevant documents and instructed other  witnesses not to produce relevant documents to the Congress but only to the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the White House did much to substantiate the evidence that it is intent on reducing U.S. attorneys and Federal law enforcement to merely another partisan political aspect of its efforts when it dispatched an anonymous senior official to take the position that the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia would not be permitted to follow the statutory mechanism to test White House assertions of executive privilege by prosecuting contempt of Congress. In essence, this White House asserts  its claim of privilege is the final word, that Congress may not review it, that no court can review it and that this White House, unlike any White House in history, is above the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two days ago, during an oversight hearing with Mr. Gonzales, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, rightly asked:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Attorney General, do you think constitutional government in the United States can survive if the President has unilateral authority to reject congressional inquiries on grounds of executive privilege and the President then acts to bar the Congress from getting a judicial determination as to whether that executive privilege is properly invoked?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no more conclusive demonstration of this administration's partisan intervention in Federal law enforcement than if this administration were to instruct the Justice Department not to pursue congressional contempt citations and intervene to prevent a U.S. attorney from fulfilling his sworn constitutional duty. In other words, telling the U.S. attorney: Violate your oath of office; don't carry out your sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws and proceed pursuant to  section 194 of title 2 of the United States Code. The President recently abused the pardon power to forestall Scooter Libby from ever serving a  single day of his 30-month sentence for conviction before a jury on multiple counts of perjury, lying to a grand jury, and obstruction of justice. Stonewalling this congressional investigation is further demonstration that this administration refuses to abide by the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This stonewalling is a dramatic break from the practices of every administration since World War II in responding to congressional oversight. In that time, Presidential advisers have testified before congressional committees 74 times voluntarily or compelled by subpoenas. During the Clinton administration, White House and administration advisers were routinely subpoenaed for documents or to appear before Congress. For example, in 1996 alone, the House Government Reform Committee issued at least  27 subpoenas to White House advisers. The veil of secrecy this administration has pulled over the White House is unprecedented and damaging to the tradition of open government by and for the people that has been a hallmark of the Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investigation into the firing for partisan purposes of U.S. attorneys, who had been appointed by this President, along with an ever-growing series of controversies and scandals have revealed an administration driven by a vision of an all-powerful Executive over our constitutional system of checks and balances, one that values loyalty over judgment, secrecy over openness, and ideology over competence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the White House stonewalling is preventing is conclusive evidence of who made the decisions to fire these Federal prosecutors. We know from the testimony that it was not the President. Everyone who has testified has said that he was not involved. None of the senior officials at the Department of Justice could testify how people were added to the list or the real reasons that people were included among the Federal prosecutors to be replaced. Indeed, the evidence we have been able to collect  points to Karl Rove and the political operatives at the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A former political director at the White House made a revealing admission in her recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee when she refused to answer questions citing the oath she took to the President. In this constitutional democracy, the oath taken by public officials is to the Constitution, not any particular President of any particular party. The Constitution itself provides the oath of office of the President. Every President since George Washington has shown to "preserve,  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." The oath for other Federal official is prescribed by Congress through statute and provides that every Federal officer's duty is not to support and defend any particular President or administration but "to support and defend the Constitution of the United States" and "to bear true faith and allegiance" to our founding principles and law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I pointed out to Ms. Taylor that the oath I have been privileged to take as a U.S. Senator is likewise to the Constitution. I proudly represent the people of Vermont. I know it is a privilege to serve as a temporary steward of the Constitution and the values and protections for the rights and liberties of the American people that it embodies. My oath is not to a political party and not even to the great institution of the U.S. Senate but to the Constitution and the rule of law. As a former prosecutor,  I feel strongly that independent law enforcement is an essential component of our democratic government, and that no one is above the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the constitutional duty of all members of the executive branch to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," the message from this White House is that the President, Vice President, and their loyal aides are above the law. No check. No balance. No accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The law says otherwise. The criminal contempt statute, 2 U.S.C.  194, provides that if a House of Congress certifies a contempt citation, the U.S. attorney to whom it is sent has a "duty" and "shall" "bring it before the grand jury for its action." For this White House to threaten to intervene in an effort to preempt further investigation, cover up the truth and avoid accountability is an insult to the rule of law. This law was duly passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by a duly  elected President of the United States. It is derived from law that has been on the books since 1857, for 150 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush-Cheney White House continues to place great strains on our constitutional system of checks and balances. Not since the darkest days of the Nixon administration have we seen efforts to corrupt federal law enforcement for partisan political gain and such efforts to avoid accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the stonewalling by this White House, the American people are left to wonder: What is it that the White House is so desperate to hide? As more and more stories leak out about the involvement of Karl Rove and his political team in political briefings of what should be nonpartisan government offices, I think we have a better sense of what they are trying to hide. We have learned of political briefings at over 20 government agencies, including briefings attended by Justice Department officials.  This week, the news was that Mr. Rove briefed diplomats on vulnerable Democratic districts before mid-term elections. Why, Senator Whitehouse properly asked at our hearing yesterday, were members of our foreign service being briefed on domestic political contests? Mr. Gonzales had no answer. Similarly, why were political operatives</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this context, is anyone surprised that the evidence in our investigation of the firings of U.S. attorneys for political purposes points to Mr. Rove and his political operations in the White House? Despite the initial White House denials, Mr. Rove's involvement in these firings is indicated by the Department of Justice documents we have obtained and from the testimony of high-ranking Department officials. This evidence shows that he was involved from the beginning in plans to remove U.S. attorneys.  E-mails show that Mr. Rove initiated inquiries at least by the beginning of 2005 as to how to proceed regarding the dismissal and replacement of U.S. attorneys. The evidence also shows that he raised political concerns, including those of New Mexico Republican</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have learned that Mr. Rove raised similar concerns with the Attorney General about prosecutors not aggressively pursuing voter fraud cases in several districts and that prior to the 2006 mid-term election he sent the Attorney General's chief of staff a packet of information containing a 30-page report concerning voting in Wisconsin in 2004. This evidence points to his role and the role of those in his office in removing or trying to remove prosecutors not considered sufficiently loyal to Republican  electoral prospects. Such manipulation shows corruption of Federal law enforcement for partisan political purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Documents and testimony also show that Mr. Rove had a role in the shaping the administration's response to congressional inquiries into these dismissals, which led to inaccurate and misleading testimony to Congress and statements to the public. This response included an attempt to cover up the role that he and other White House officials played in the firings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the stonewalling and obstruction, we have learned that Todd Graves, U.S. attorney in the Western District of Missouri, was fired after he expressed reservations about a lawsuit that would have stripped many African-American voters from the rolls in Missouri. When the Attorney General replaced Mr. Graves with Bradley Schlozman, the person pushing the lawsuit, that case was filed and ultimately thrown out of court. Once in place in Missouri though, Mr. Schlozman also brought indictments  on the eve of a closely contested</paragraph>
    <paragraph>election, despite the Justice Department policy not to do so. This is what happens when a responsible prosecutor is replaced by a "loyal Bushie" for partisan, political purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Schlozman also bragged about hiring ideological soulmates. Monica Goodling likewise admitted "crossing the line" when she used a political litmus test for career prosecutors and immigration judges. Rather than keep Federal law enforcement above politics, this administration is more intent on placing its actions above the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Washington has been very good to let me have this time. With our service of these subpoenas, I hope that the White House takes this opportunity to reconsider its blanket claim of executive privilege, especially in light of the testimony that President was not involved in the dismissals of these U.S. attorneys. I hope that the White House steps back from this constitutional crisis of its own making so that we can begin to repair the damage done by its untoward interference with  federal law enforcement. That interference has threatened our elections and seriously undercut the American people's confidence in the independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement. Mr. Rove and the White House must not be allowed to continue manipulating our justice system to pursue a partisan political</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a cloud over this White House and a gathering storm. I hope they will reconsider their course and end their cover up so that we can move forward together to repair the damage done to the Department of Justice and the American people's trust and confidence in Federal law enforcement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me notify all Members of the Senate that Senator Norm Coleman's father passed away this morning. Therefore, he missed the vote that we just had and will be missing votes for the remainder of this week. I know I speak for all Members of the Senate in sending our condolences to Senator Coleman and his family at this very sad time. We look forward to having him back in the Senate in due time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to make a few observations about the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Over the past few days, members of the Democratic leadership have commented about Judge Southwick's nomination. These comments have, in my view, mischaracterized his record and his service to the people of his State. Worse still, some of our Democratic colleagues have made insinuations about the commitment of this fine man to the principle  of equal justice for all. These gross insinuations are, of course, at odds with the views of his peers and his home State Senators, both of whom actually know him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So over the next several days, we will continue to set the record straight, as the ranking member did so ably yesterday, to ensure that the Senate does not treat dishonorably an honorable man, a fine judge, and a courageous war veteran. Judge Southwick deserves more from this country than insinuation and innuendo. This leads me to a much broader point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, the majority leader, and I have an understanding--at least I believe we had an understanding--as to how this Senate would treat judicial nominees in general. A fundamental component of that understanding is that individual nominees will be treated fairly. That commitment to fair treatment may be in serious jeopardy with the Southwick nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues that the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved Judge Southwick for a lifetime appointment to the district court just last fall, but it is now threatening to kill his nomination on a party-line vote in committee. The only material change in Judge Southwick's qualifications between last fall and now is the rating of the American Bar Association, the Democrats' gold standard for judicial nominees. The ABA has actually increased its rating of Judge Southwick. In other words,  they have given him a higher rating for the circuit court than for the district court. Judge Southwick was rated "well qualified" for the district court. He is now rated "unanimously well qualified," which means every single member of the committee who took a look at his credentials for the circuit court found Judge Southwick well qualified. That is the highest possible rating one can achieve for a judicial nomination from the American Bar Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes without saying that for committee Democrats to oppose Judge Southwick for the circuit court after having supported him for the district without any change in the man's record would certainly fall far short of treating the man fairly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my Democratic colleagues to think hard about the implications of unfair treatment for Judge Southwick for this Congress and, for that matter, for future Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Landrieu joined me in including important language in the Senate report that accompanies the Homeland Security Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This language addresses a serious trade problem that is affecting the United States and many of its most critical industries. Our report language directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to undertake a more vigorous approach to collecting unpaid antidumping and countervailing duties which are owed the  United States under the U.S. trade laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our report language, the Appropriations Committee directs CBP to work with the Departments of Commerce and Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to increase the collection of duties owed on unfairly traded U.S. imports. CBP--Customs and Border Protection--is directed to provide an annual report to the committee within 30 days of each year's distributions under the Continued Dumping and Subsidies Offset Act. The CBP report must summarize the Agency's efforts to collect past-due  amounts and to increase current collections, particularly with respect to cases involving unfairly traded U.S. imports from China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Act--also known as the Byrd amendment--was enacted on October 28 in the year of our Lord 2000. It provides that assessed duties received pursuant to either an antidumping or a countervailing duty order must be distributed by Customs to affected domestic producers for certain expenditures that the producers incurred after the order was put in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 4, 2007, CBP transmitted to Congress a fiscal year 2006 report on annual antidumping and countervailing duties collected on a case-by-case basis. The report stated that while CBP distributed nearly $400 million to more than 1,700 affected domestic producers in fiscal year 2006, a whopping--hear me--a whopping $146,391,239.89 was due but never--never--collected. Astoundingly, the amount of uncollected antidumping and countervailing duties not collected since 2000 is approaching $700 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read that again. Hear me now. Astoundingly, the amount of uncollected antidumping and countervailing duties not collected since the year 2000 is approaching $700 million, with the largest uncollected amount, over $400 million, owed in a single case: dumped crawfish tail meat from China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 20, 2007, CBP advised that, since October 1, 2001, CBP has simply "written off" $30.3 million in uncollected antidumping and countervailing duties. The greatest amount written off, again, was in the case of crawfish meat from China, where CBP wrote off nearly $7.5 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a lot of money. This is money that otherwise would have been distributed directly to eligible U.S. crawfish producers. This means these funds will never be distributed to the hundreds of deserving American families to whom they are owed. What a shame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Have Senators heard of Moon Landrieu? That was this Senator's father, Senator Landrieu. I would like to ask my esteemed colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, if she is similarly concerned about our Government's failure to collect these funds, recompense which is now lost--to whom? To Louisiana's honest and hard-working crawfish farmers and processors.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Byrd, because I am extremely concerned about this situation and hope we could find a remedy. I commend the Senator for his work over many years, to try to make sure our trade laws are fairly enforced and that agreements we have entered into, with countries such as China and others, are followed. But in this instance, as the Senator has so eloquently stated in this discussion this morning on the floor, this situation is not being handled correctly. Our industries,  particularly in Louisiana, that he has mentioned, our crawfish producers have lost more money from the failure of U.S. importers to pay duties owed by China than any industry in our Nation. In Louisiana alone--I know it might be hard for people to believe this, but as spring rolls around, it will become quite evident--we have 3,300 crawfish farmers in our State and over 40 processors who employ a tremendous</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding--and the Senator from West Virginia is very aware--that our Customs officials are required to collect these duties, but they are not being collected. Many of these importers simply close up shop, they change their names, they move offshore, they reorganize, and evidently we are not able to collect the money that is owed to us. It is a great detriment to this particular industry and to others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have expressed concern over the years. We are going to continue to press this issue. We will continue in Congress to work to solve this problem. I feel very strongly that our U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Gutierrez, and the U.S. Trade Ambassador, Susan Schwab, should take this up directly with the China Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. China sought to become a WTO member. It is my firm belief, if China wants to receive the benefits that accrue to them through WTO,  they should enforce them and help us, and we should do a better job of making sure the importers abide by the rules we have agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very pleased to see in response to concerns raised by the Senate, GAO recently announced it has begun an indepth investigation as to why our Government cannot seem to collect duties owed to U.S. industries on goods imported from China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2003, the total amount of uncollected duties on all antidumping countervailing duty orders for all countries totaled $630 million. Of this amount, $485 million, or 77 percent of the total, relates to 34 specific antidumping and countervailing duty orders that have been imposed by the United States on agriculture and aquacultural imports from all countries. Of that $485 million, 73 percent relate to six antidumping orders that have been imposed on U.S. agricultural and aquacultural imports  from China alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the biggest duty noncollection problem in my State relates to the crawfish industry, as the Senator from West Virginia most certainly knows, Louisiana also is experiencing a problem with our catfish farmers. I see the senior Senator from Mississippi. This affects Mississippi, it affects Arkansas, it affects Alabama. We were unable to collect almost one-third of the fees that are owed to our catfish farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are hard-working businesspeople who work long hours, who are trying to run these industries and abide by all environmental regulations, pay their taxes, abide by all the wage and hour laws in this country. When we enter into trade agreements, the least our Government can do is enforce them. That is what I come to the floor to express my concern about, through this colloquy with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Senator for his tireless work. We are going to press on this issue of noncollection. I hope, even if this Subsidy Offset Act expires, our Government will continue to collect the money that is owed to us during the time this act was in effect. It means a great deal to the small businesses in my State, to crawfishers and catfish producers equally. I am hoping we can make some progress and do not continue to have our trade laws undermined in this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for this time on the floor and I thank him for his continued work on this issue.</paragraph>

  <chair>The Senator from North Dakota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sent a second-degree amendment to the desk to the Landrieu amendment. My second degree will not strike her amendment. As a matter of fact, it will add at the end of her amendment the provisions of an amendment I had offered on Defense authorization. I am to chair the Democratic Policy Committee luncheon in a few minutes so I am not able to speak at length about this amendment. I intend to do that at some later point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to mention what Senator Landrieu has described in her first-degree amendment, the interest in having as our major policy goal here with respect to the fight against terrorism, the destruction of and elimination of the leadership of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden. My amendment is one I had offered, as I said, to the Defense authorization bill, previously. It is an amendment that requires a quarterly classified report to be offered to the Congress that would tell us what is being done  to bring to justice the leadership of al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason for offering that is quite simple. A week ago, we had a new National Intelligence Estimate, an NIE, given to the Congress in classified and unclassified form; an NIE that was reported to the American people. The reports were not particularly surprising but in some ways stunning. The report says the greatest terrorist threat to our homeland, in this country--the greatest terrorist threat to our homeland is al-Qaida and its leadership. It also says al-Qaida and its leadership is in a  secure hideaway or safe harbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the question for which there is no answer: Why, nearly 6 years after &#xD0;9/11/2001, in which Osama bin Laden boasted about engineering the murder of thousands of innocent Americans--why, after 6 years, is there a safe harbor or secure hideaway anywhere on this planet for the leadership of al-Qaida and for Osama bin Laden? That, in my judgment, is a failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of briefings in this Congress; some of them classified, top secret briefings. There are no briefings  that I am aware of on what is being done or what has not been done to bring to justice, to apprehend, and eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. Those briefings do not exist. One of the reasons that perhaps we have not seen progress in bringing to justice and eliminating the leadership of al-Qaida is the President himself said: I don't think  much about that. I don't think much, don't care much about Osama bin Laden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you believe the intelligence estimates, they are today planning additional attacks against this country. Yesterday, we woke up to the news that there are apparently dry runs, they think--our intelligence people think there are dry runs being made in our airports with various things packed in luggage by terrorists who want to do potential attacks later. We hear all these reports and the question remains: Why is it the leadership of the organization that poses the greatest terrorist threat to  this country has a secure hideaway somewhere or a safe haven somewhere? There ought not be a square inch of ground on this planet that is safe for those who murdered Americans on 9/11, for those who pose the greatest threat to this country. That is intolerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense authorization bill will come back to the floor of the Senate, I guess. This amendment I have offered is in that piece of legislation. But to make certain this amendment becomes law and gets to the desk of the President for signature, I have offered it to this appropriations bill. I understand it fits better on Defense authorization. My hope is that is where it will wind up on the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me we went through agonizing debates and passionate debates on the floor of the Senate about the war in Iraq. I respect everybody's opinion on those issues. But while we have soldiers who got up this morning and strapped on body armor and got in humvees and then went and knocked door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war, where Shias are killing Sunnis and Sunnis are killing Shias and Shias and Sunnis are both killing Americans--while that happened this morning in the middle  of a civil war, we have the greatest terrorist threat to this country apparently in a safe harbor or secure hideaway. That ought not exist. First things first. Let's fight the terrorists first and defeat the terrorists first. That ought to be the first and most important priority and responsibility. If they are the greatest threat to this country, let's eliminate that threat. That ought to be the goal of this country. That is why I offer this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Senator, tell the Senate about his amendment again. Let me hear about the amendment again.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment has two parts to it. No. 1, it increases the reward for the elimination of the al-Qaida leadership and Osama bin Laden, and, No. 2, it required a quarterly classified report to be made to the Congress, every quarter, from this administration and from any administration, to say what they are doing, to tell us what they have been doing to try to apprehend and bring to justice and eliminate the leadership of the greatest terrorist threat to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it too much to ask that we ought to be informed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>No.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>We ought to understand what is being done or what is not being done. I think the American people have a reason to ask the question: Why, nearly 6 years later, do we now read--and I have read it on a number of occasions in unclassified versions of classified reports that say--there is a secure hideaway for Osama bin Laden and the leadership of al-Qaida?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a secure hideaway. There is safe haven. Now, why should any place on this Earth be secure or safe for those who would attack this country?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Where? Where? Where is that, Senator?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, the intelligence reports indicate that somewhere between Pakistan and Afghanistan, in the tribal-controlled mountainous regions, there is some sort of safe hideaway or secure hideaway or safe haven, as they call it. I have flown over this region. I have looked down, and I know there is no border. You cannot tell what country you are in. I have flown over the region that they call tribal-controlled between Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no evidence of a country boundary.  It is a tough country, tough region, I understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if we now have al-Qaida reconstituting and rebuilding training camps, which they are doing--they are recruiting new recruits, they are building training camps, they are planning attacks against the West, planning attacks against the United States of America, and doing so in a secure hideaway or safe haven--then I say that is wrong. It ought to be job No. 1 for this country to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida that represents the greatest threat to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the purpose of this amendment, to say we want that to be the overriding and overarching goal, and we want reports, classified reports every single quarter of what has been done or what has not been done because I do not believe, frankly, this has been a significant priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It certainly should have been. If it has not been in the past, at least let's make it so in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As I said, I have to chair the Democratic policy committee luncheon in just a moment. I wanted to make a comment on the amendments that have been offered, and perhaps after the policy committee luncheon, if these issues are still pending, I will be able to comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Vitter has offered an amendment dealing with prescription drugs. Senator Cochran has second-degreed that amendment, as I understand it. I believe we ought to have access to lower priced prescription drugs, FDA-approved prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lower priced prescription drugs exist in virtually every other country of the world. Why should the American consumer not have the capability to acquire them under our current rules? I would say that we already have a circumstance where we are allowed about a 90-day supply of drugs, if someone walks across the border or drives across and comes back with a personal use, 90-day supply. Very few Americans live close enough to the border to be able to do that. But we have an amendment that is a broad  bipartisan amendment; 30-some Members of the Senate have worked on it, cosponsored it. This will not be the legislation in which we consider that amendment, I do not expect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment that Senator Vitter has offered, as second-degreed by Senator Cochran, would simply restate current rules; that is, currently what is allowed. It would simply restate current rules, which I assume offends no one but accomplishes nothing as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my understanding there are 11 amendments pending on this bill. There are points of order that lie against several of them. And the managers will make those whenever they see fit. I hope that those people who have other amendments pending would agree to short time agreements on them and accept a time for voting. Maybe the managers can even accept some of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill we want to finish today. It is an important piece of legislation. It has been improved in many different ways, not the least of which is this border security legislation that was passed earlier today. So I hope that Democrats and Republicans who offered these amendments will contact the managers and agree on a reasonable period of time so we can vote. It is 1 o'clock in the afternoon. It is important we do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not want to sound like a stuck record, but we have to finish this legislation before we go home in August. We have to finish the SCHIP bill before we go home in August. We have a 9/11 conference report we have to finish before we go home in August. We have the ethics and lobbying reform we have to finish before we go home in August. We are going to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody should understand--and, of course, I mentioned on the floor about the bill that Senators Boxer and  Inhofe have worked on dealing with WRDA, which is so important to the whole country, but certainly important to the western part of the United States.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me say that on the amendment I just offered, I would be glad to a 10-minute time agreement when we get ready. I expect we will not need a recorded vote on that. But I know, as the Senator from Nevada is pointing out, we had an objection to even the motion to proceed on this bill, which was strange to me. Why would anybody have objected to proceeding?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we get a bill on the floor, and Senator Byrd, Senator Cochran, the chairman and ranking member, I know they want to get this done. I believe we ought to get these appropriations bills through and out of here. This is a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this afternoon Senators can come and offer the amendments. I hope we can get this bill done today. It is not just this bill, we have got a lot of appropriations bills we have to do. So the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, has an important message: We need to get this appropriations bill done. It deals with homeland security after all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is a really good example to set for the other people offering amendments. I would also say, as I said on the Senate floor this morning, there is an extremely important congressional delegation that is scheduled to be in Greenland this weekend. I would really like--first of all, I would like to have gone on the trip. But there are 10 or 11 Senators scheduled to go on that trip. I hope that trip can take place. But we are going to have to get this legislation done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we get some idea that there is a real stall going on here, we will have to file cloture on the conference report  dealing with homeland security, the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and that vote would not take place until Saturday. So we are doing our best to work through all of this. But I want everyone to know, as I have said here so many times, we have a very few things to do, but we are going to do them. And it is no bluff. We have a whole month to complete everything in August. I hope people will help us work through that so that is not necessary.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like for our majority leader to say that again.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would be happy to do that for my distinguished friend, the senior Senator from the State of West Virginia, of the West Virginia hills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have four things to do for sure: the bill we are on now, this appropriations bill, children's health, the conference report on the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and the message that we are going to get from the House on ethics and lobbying reform. Those four things are essential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The luxury we would have is also to complete WRDA. The conference report is important. We should be able to do that quickly. We got a huge vote when it came out of here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the things that we must do before we leave. This is not anything new that I just sprung on anybody. That is something that I have been saying for a long time. We have made great progress. I am very happy with it. We were able to get Wounded Warriors done. We were able to get the pay raise for the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. We were also able to pass for the first time in 3 years the higher education bill--that is important--reconciliation, getting the biggest change in how  students are able to go to our schools in our country since the GI bill. We have a few things we need to do, and we really need to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat, it is almost 1 o'clock on Thursday. I will be happy to work into the night to complete this bill. I say that the managers of the bill says it all, Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran. They are the best we have.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.</paragraph>

  <chair>The amendment, as modified, is as follows:</chair>
  <chair> On page 69, after line 24, add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sec. 536.  None of the funds made available in this Act for U.S. Customs and Border Protection or any agency or office within the Department of Homeland Security may be used to prevent an individual from importing a prescription drug from Canada if--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) such individual--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) is not in the business of importing a prescription drug (within the meaning of section 801(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(g))); and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) such drug--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) complies with sections 501, 502, and 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, and 355); and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) is not--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) a controlled substance, as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802); or</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will be happy to explain exactly what the modification is. The modification simply takes one phrase out of the previous version of my amendment. And that single phrase in the old version of my amendment limited the amendment to a 90-day supply of prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That limitation is now taken out of my amendment. That is the only thing the modification does. Now, the purpose of the modification is to now make it a pure funding limitation amendment so that it is not subject to the point of order of authorizing on an appropriations bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to walk everyone through where we are right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 15 or 20 minutes ago, the majority leader came over to the Senate to talk to us about moving quickly through the Homeland Security appropriations bill that is now on the floor because, as he described, we have many  items of business that need to be accomplished before the Senate goes into recess for the August break. He asked the managers of this legislation, Senators BYRD and COCHRAN, to work with Senators who have pending amendments  to move them through in an orderly fashion so we could possibly finish this bill by tonight and go on to the rest of the business that needs to be completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In complying with that, Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran and myself worked out an agreement to begin to deal with some of those amendments. That is how we work in the Senate. We would never finish everything if we didn't take some time to have conversations to figure out how we can work through amendments in an orderly fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 11 amendments currently pending that we are trying to work our way through. One of those amendments is an amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, which he had a right to come and offer. It was not the pending matter. The pending matter was the Landrieu amendment, second degreed by the Dorgan amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to get to the amendment offered by Senator Vitter, we had to agree by unanimous consent to set that aside. We talked to the Senator and agreed on a process to dispose of his amendment. Senator Byrd, Senator Cochran, Senator Vitter, and I were here to come to an agreement that Senator Vitter would offer his amendment. He understood that a point of order lay against that regarding whether it was a rule XVI. He understood that Senator Cochran's  second-degree amendment also was in the same procedural difficulty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agreement was that we would agree to lay the amendment aside, Senator Vitter would set aside the amendment, go to his amendment, and a point of order would lie against it, as well as a point of order against the second degree offered by Senator Cochran. It sounds complex, but the upshot was, it would dispose of the amendment, a point of order would lie against it, and we would move on to the other numerous amendments that now lay before the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this body, it is extremely important that we all have the opportunity to work out these agreements so we can work through bills in an orderly fashion. I assumed that would be the case, that we had all agreed upon that and that would be the order this would go to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, when the Senator rose to ask to set aside the amendment, according to the agreement we agreed to, I did not object. The Senator went to his amendment, and instead of going through the process we had all agreed upon, he sent a modification to the desk that changed his underlying amendment and meant that it no longer had a point of order lying against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a difficult position it puts us all in because we have 11 amendments, possibly more, to get through. If we can't come to an agreement and trust each other on how the process is going to move forward and go outside that, we are not going to be able to get through these amendments, because this Senate really is based on trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam President, we are now in the parliamentary position where we have gone back to the regular order. Another amendment is pending. If we move through these in proper fashion, the amendment offered by Senator Vitter will now be at the end of 12 amendments that are now in order. At some point we will get to it, but we now are in a difficult position of: How do we move through all these other amendments that are being offered? How do we deal with all the other Senators who are going  to come to the floor and ask us to work through these amendments, if we cannot have an agreement that this Senate--when Senators stand on the floor and agree to it--knows that is what will occur? So we find ourselves in a very difficult position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see the majority leader is on the Senate floor and will yield to him if he would like to make a statement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I gave a talk a week ago tomorrow to a group of people. It was a church meeting. There were adults and young adults there. I told them about my experience serving in the Congress. I have served in the House, and I have served in the Senate. It is not like when I practiced law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I practiced law, you put everything in writing. We do not do that in the Congress. We do not do that in the Senate. Your word is your bond. If a Republican Senator or a Democratic Senator--it does not matter--if you tell them you are going to do something, that is the way it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show how powerful and important that is, Alan Bible was a Senator from Nevada who served 20 years and became ill. He retired. When he passed away--there was a plane that was always available to take Senators to funerals. The plane was scheduled to go to Nevada so Senators could attend Alan Bible's funeral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a Republican on that airplane, Ted Stevens. The reason he was on that airplane was there was a vote very important to Ted Stevens dealing with Alaskan oil. Alan Bible had given his word he was going to vote with Ted Stevens. There was tremendous pressure on Alan Bible. Alan Bible's vote was the essential vote, and he withstood all the pressure and voted with Ted Stevens. That is the reason Ted Stevens went to Reno, NV: to honor the life of  Alan Bible because he kept his word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we do in this Senate. We keep our word. It does not matter with whom you make an arrangement; if you tell him you are going to do something, if you tell her you are going to do something, that is the way it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my disappointment in what has happened in the last few minutes is--it appears Senator Murray said it in a more discreet fashion than I am going to say it. Somebody did not keep their word. And that, I suggest, should be worked out. I think if someone in this body is known to have broken their word--and I was part of the little conversation right here--you do not take advantage of people. There are a lot of rules that allow you to take advantage of people, but you cannot do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is not appropriate. This is wrong. And I would hope that the Senator from Louisiana would kind of retrace his steps and back off and put us back where we should be. If that is not the case, and he chooses not to do that, I think it is going to be a difficult time, I would suggest, for him making other arrangements with Senators in the future because that is how we do business here.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you for the courtesy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, let me say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I have the utmost respect for him. I just want to clarify that it certainly is not my intent to delay anything. I am happy to proceed with votes on this bill--all votes that are lined up, and other votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to make this offer, if it would clarify or help heal the past situation. I apologize if anything was miscommunicated regarding the last hour or so. But if it would help heal that, I would be happy to withdraw my pending amendment as long as I was given the opportunity and assured of an opportunity to file a new amendment, which is germane, and that could be made pending. And, of course, in that context, I would have no objection to anyone, including Senator Cochran,  being able to offer a second-degree amendment on that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would be happy to withdraw my pending amendment as long as I could be given the opportunity to submit an amendment that could be made pending rather than have the clock run out or have proceedings and votes on the bill happen before that amendment would be made pending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, again, my main point is, it is certainly not my intent to delay this bill, or any votes on amendments or the bill, and I am eager to proceed with all of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for the courtesy of yielding.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, last November was one of those truly rare moments in the short history of our country and our democracy. Any political science student taking a freshman lecture, of course, will hear how incredibly hard it is to remove entrenched congressional majorities. They know the statistics about how hard it is to defeat incumbents around here. It doesn't happen that often. But sometimes, the American people rise up in one moment, as they did last November, and they make history.  Just six times in our 230-year history has one party lost both Houses of Congress, and 2006 was the first time the Republican Party failed to win a single House, Senate, or gubernatorial office previously held by the Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We Democrats have been in that predicament. In 1994, Democrats woke up to a landslide defeat some people thought would never come. It wasn't always easy, it wasn't always collegial, but we listened and we learned. Together, we reached across the aisle to balance the budget and reform welfare. We wrestled with why we had lost, and we wrestled with what we had to do in order to come together--not just as a party but as a country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Evidently, some people still haven't wrestled with what happened last November 7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last November, Americans were appropriately angry. They saw our young men and women in uniform paying the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq for a failed policy that was stuck on autopilot. They saw the number of Americans without health insurance skyrocket to 45 million, with more hard-working Americans joining them every day. They saw record-high oil prices and global climate change--a reality denied and deferred and no serious national effort to address these issues. They saw staggering corruption  and no accountability for the way the people's House had been turned into a refuge for the special interests. Americans saw a politics and a party that was broken, and they rejected the stubbornness, cynicism, corruption, and failed policies that made "Washington" a dirty word. They voted for a change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush seemed to get the message the day after the 2006 election when he said to America:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message yesterday was clear. The American people want their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and work together to address the challenges facing our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President said he got the message, but the question has to be asked: What have Republicans done since then? Where are they 6 months after their worst electoral defeat in 50 years? What happened to the President's postelection statements when measured against the President's actions and those of the Republican minority in the Senate? Those actions tell a very different story. Before the dust had settled, before defeated Republicans had even cleaned out their offices, this President and his  remaining allies in Congress have made a calculation, on issue after issue, that they would just set out to stop everything from happening and then they would turn  around and they would ask: Why is nothing happening under the Democrats? This is a pure political calculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been busy debating progress in Iraq around here and measuring benchmarks. I can't help but think as we talk about measuring benchmarks that pretty soon the Iraqi Government is going to wonder whether the Republican caucus is going to meet any of its benchmarks or any of the country's benchmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6 months now, the Democratic majority has worked in good faith to deliver on our promises to the American people. Because of the Democratic majority, the minimum wage earner in America now makes 70 cents an hour more than they did under a Republican Congress--and soon they will be making $2 more. The longest streak without a raise in the minimum wage in the history of the minimum wage has ended but not before 4 months of Republican obstruction cost each minimum wage earner in America around</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed legislation to make college more affordable and cut interest rates in half for millions of Americans with student loans. We stood up to powerful special interests and raised the fuel efficiency of our automobiles by 10 miles per gallon. Twenty years had passed since Washington raised the fuel standards, but Democrats took on the special interests and got it passed. We passed funding for stem cell research. We passed the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We passed ethics and lobbying  reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just yesterday, we passed legislation that will fix many of the shortfalls in our care for injured troops and veterans, and, over yet another White House veto threat, we also passed a 3.5-percent raise for members of the military. Most importantly, we passed legislation demanding that the President face reality and begin redeploying troops from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, there is, on almost every one of these issues, today as I stand here a gap between how many of those policies that are aimed to help everyday Americans, which enjoy the majority support of the Senate, and how many have actually been signed into law. Why? One simple reason: The President and his allies in Congress have decided to use every means at their disposal just to slow it down and block it, to stand for a policy of obstruction and obstruction and obstruction, not accomplishment  for the American people. They have vetoed and filibustered and killed bills in conference. They have wasted days and days with procedural motions and delays that have nothing more to do in their purpose than to waste time and squander the trust and patience of the American people and, ultimately, to hope to be able to blame it on the Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just look at what they have blocked. They vetoed a Senate bill demanding a new strategy in Iraq. They vetoed a stem cell research bill, science that could prove crucial to cures for 100 million Americans with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or diabetes or other diseases. Now, another veto is threatened on children's health care--of all things, children's health care--a veto threat on a bill the President hasn't even read, because he was worried about the price tag. Well, we are talking about our children's  health, and the bill offered just $7 billion each year for uninsured children, while we spend 1 1/2  times that amount every month in Iraq. Those are just the bills which made it to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Republicans blocked a vote on a bill to allow the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal Government to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for 43 million Americans on Medicare. Republicans are blocking the passage of a bill that would provide crucial funding for the intelligence community. They are blocking ethics bills that would mark the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate. They don't have the votes to stop it, so they are pulling a procedural maneuver and refusing to appoint conferees in order to hammer out the final details of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans are now setting records for filibusters and obstruction. The Senate record for filibusters is being set already, and it is only halfway through this term. To paraphrase Winston Churchill: Never, in the field of Senate legislation, was so much progress blocked for so many by so few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Actually, they have made history, I suppose, because thanks to the Senate Republicans, L.A. is no longer the center of gridlock in America--it is right here. On issue after issue, the Republicans have chosen to filibuster--and to do so just 2 short years after they declared the filibuster, as their then-leader, Bill Frist, said in late 2004, "nothing less than the tyranny of the minority." After expressing outrage at the mere hint of a Democratic filibuster last session, the Republicans have  suddenly become the principled champions of so-called minority rights in the Senate, but minority rights apply to legitimate filibusters for legitimate issues, not a policy of obstruction to stop everything that comes along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After threatening the so-called "nuclear option" when Democrats stood up to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they have introduced a filibuster to stop everyday business in the Senate. Almost everything the majority leader tries to do here now requires us having a cloture vote in order to prevent a filibuster. In fact, the rubberstamp Republicans of the previous 7 years have now become the roadblock Republicans. The party of Abraham Lincoln has become the party of redtape--vetoes,  filibusters--any means necessary to deny the will of the majority of the Senate and the vast majority of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you don't believe me, listen to what the minority whip, Senator Trent Lott, told a reporter just this April. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The strategy of being obstructionists can work or fail, and so far, it is working for us--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "us" being the Republican Party and the minority in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I think the Senator is looking at it the wrong way. The question isn't, Is it working for Republicans, is it working for Democrats? The question is, Is it working for the American people? Is it working for the millions of low-income children whose health care funding the President has threatened to veto? Is it making us safer when you block the funding for the intelligence agencies? Is this obstructionist strategy working for the 12 million Americans forced to live in the shadows of American  life while our borders stay broken? Is it working for the 554 soldiers who have died in Iraq since Republicans first blocked a measure to redeploy troops last February?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of the Senate's highest shared principles of consensus and bipartisan accomplishment, the Republicans have chosen the lowest common denominator--a zero sum game in which they are willing to gamble the American people's loss for Republican gain. The Republican strategy seems to be to slash the tires of the Senate and then wonder why we are still stuck on the side of the road and blame somebody else for that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear what I am criticizing here. I support the right of the minority to filibuster. In fact, I have done so myself. Every Senator in this body has that right. I support that right. But when filibustering not for the principle of the issue at hand but for the generic, broad strategy of stopping what happens here so you can blame the party in charge for not being able to finish the work, that is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rights of the minority in the Senate ought to be protected, but they also ought to be used responsibly too. Do I have a problem with time?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Yes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent for a few more minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, obstruction for obstruction's sake is not in the best traditions of this great institution. It is the worst kind of cynical political calculation. I think all of us on our side would join in voting to protect the right of the minority to be able to filibuster. We all understand that what goes around comes around, and the time may come when we again may be in the minority. We Democrats don't want to use the nuclear option. We are  not  even talking about it. We want to pass bills. We want to pass bills that are supported by a majority of people in the Senate, including Republicans, and certainly supported by the majority of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my Republican colleagues that there is a better way to do business. We can work together and actually do something positive for the American people. All of us know this is a uniquely challenging moment for this country. We face new threats and hurdles no generation has faced before. We ought to be working together to solve those problems. The only chance this Senate has to make a real contribution to history is to make a bipartisan contribution. That is the only way the Senate meets  its own expectations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the great legislative accomplishments in recent memory came under mixed Government, when both sides of the aisle came together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1981, Ronald Reagan saw that Social Security was in danger of going bankrupt and placed a call to the Democratic speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill. They realized that at the end of the day, nobody would solve it if they didn't. So they got together and took the politics out of a tough and unpopular vote. The deal they struck kept Social Security afloat. Neither man could have done it without the other. Neither party could have done it without the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the limits of a politics of division, of partisan sectarianism. A politics of division can rush our country into war, but it cannot sustain our trust or the war itself. A politics of division has no answer for 12 million undocumented workers in our houses, fields, and factories. It has no answer for 45 million Americans with no health insurance, no answer for icecaps that are melting or a failed policy in Iraq. The politics of division is bad for America--from the Parkinson's patient  to the undocumented immigrant to the soldier in Iraq. Nobody is benefiting from Republican obstructionism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also bad for the Senate. This Senate has been known as the greatest deliberative body in the world. But there is nothing deliberative about partisan sabotage. There is nothing deliberative about blind obstructionism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ongoing debate we have here is about much more than Senate procedure. At its core is a debate, really, about where we are headed in our relationship with each other, Republicans and Democrats. All of us go home and hear from our constituents about how they have lost faith in Washington. All of us want to do right by the people who elected us and try to make life better for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any Senator who has been here for a period of time has watched the decline of the quality of the exchange on both sides of the aisle in this institution. I have seen colleagues stand up against it. I remember when Senator Gordon Smith, in the middle a painful debate on Iraq, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My soul cries out for something more dignified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle are concerned for the Senate. Voters want a debate over ideas, not a war of words; a choice of direction, not a clash of cloture votes. The stalemate we have now is not what the Senate is renowned for. This is called, as I said, the greatest deliberative body in the world, a place where people on both sides can find common ground and get good things done for other people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, we are accountable to the American people--accountable for false promises, accountable for failure to address issues we promised to address, whether it is energy independence or military families who lose their benefits. We are accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a filibuster to stop all progress, then claim Democrats aren't doing anything, is a failed strategy. It is a failure because it doesn't put the American people first. I believe the American people will hold a party of obstruction accountable. I hope that will change.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it has been 2,144 days since 9/11. We all remember the day our Nation was attacked. That attack was led by Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida. At the time, the President said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act will not stand. We will find those who did it. We will smoke them out of their holes. We will bring them to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 2,144 days have passed, and still we have not brought Osama bin Laden or al-Zawahiri or the rest of the top leadership of al-Qaida to justice. These are the people who led the attack on our country. It wasn't Saddam Hussein and Iraq; it was Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Yet this Nation lost focus under the leadership of this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the most striking story of all is this from the USA Today in late March 2004:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, troops from the 5th Special Forces Group who specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to  prepare for their next assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with expertise in Spanish cultures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are not a lot of Spanish speakers in Afghanistan or in Pakistan. That is where Osama bin Laden is still lurking, still hiding, still waiting to strike our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says: Let's remember who attacked America, and let's finish business with him and his al-Qaida network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have now learned this week, according to the New York Times, that a 2005 raid on al-Qaida chiefs was called off at the last minute by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission was called off after Rumsfeld rejected an 11th hour appeal from Porter Goss, Director of the CIA. Members of the Navy Seals unit in parachute gear had already boarded C-130 cargo planes in Afghanistan when the mission was canceled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says: Let's put the focus back on Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. Let's finish business with the people who attacked America.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, is recognized.</chair>

  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my understanding is that we have a 2 o'clock vote on this amendment. This amendment is one Senator Conrad and I had offered on the Defense authorization bill. That bill, as you know, is no longer on the floor of the Senate. So we offer it now to this legislation. Just as my colleague from Louisiana has previously offered an amendment with respect to the objective and the priority of eliminating the leadership of al-Qaida, this amendment we offered about 2 weeks  ago would do two things: increase the reward for Osama bin Laden and the leaders of al-Qaida; No. 2, and most important, it would require quarterly top-secret classified briefings to this Congress every quarter about what is or is not being done to bring to justice, to capture, or kill the leadership of al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we want to do this? It has been nearly 6 years since thousands of Americans were murdered--innocent Americans murdered by Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. They boasted about engineering the murder of innocent Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what last week's National Intelligence Estimate says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That doesn't need much interpretation. The most serious threat to our homeland is al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We assess the group has protected or regenerated key elements of its homeland attack capability, including a safe haven in the Pakistan federally administered tribal areas, operational lieutenants, and its top leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anybody in this country believe there ought to be a safe haven on this  planet for those who  boasted about murdering thousands of innocent Americans? Does anybody believe there ought to be secure hideaways or a safe haven for the leadership of al-Qaida that, today, in the mountains somewhere, are planning attacks against this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why, after 6 years, are we not successful in bringing to justice and limiting the leadership of al-Qaida? It is not as if we don't know all of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is in June:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida regroups in new sanctuary on the Pakistan border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the U.S. presses on in its war against insurgents linked to al-Qaida in Iraq, bin Laden's group is recruiting, regrouping, and rebuilding in a new sanctuary. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is from the New York Times in February:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terror officials see al-Qaida chiefs regaining power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senior leaders from al-Qaida are operating from Pakistan near the Afghan border, according to American intelligence and counterterrorism officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much more do we need to understand? We have soldiers in Iraq going door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil war, where Sunni and Shia are killing each other and Sunni and Shia are both killing American soldiers. In the middle of a civil war, we have soldiers going door to door in Baghdad and, in the meantime, we have al-Qaida building training camps in a secure hideaway between Pakistan and Afghanistan. And today, this afternoon, they are planning additional attacks against our country.  That is unbelievable to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in August 2001, the Presidential daily briefing given to this President said the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the title. Nearly 6 years later, we now have intelligence assessments with this title:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida better positioned to strike the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what I call failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must succeed. That is why we ask with this amendment for quarterly classified top-secret briefings to this Congress to tell us what they are doing or what they are not doing to bring to justice and to eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. It is unbelievable to me that Osama bin Laden, who boasted of attacking this country, now apparently is in a secure hideaway or a safe haven. Nowhere on this small planet should there be somewhere safe for the leader of the organization or the leadership  of the organization that launched the attack on this country in 2001. It is unbelievable to me that we are in this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the President said this when asked about it:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don't care. It is not that important and it is not our priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the words of President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read the words of the National Intelligence Estimate of last week that came out from this administration:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe we ought to modify that statement of the President because it ought to be our priority. That is what this amendment is about. It should have been our priority 4 years ago, 5 years ago. It ought to be our priority today. I know of no more important priority for this country than dealing with the leadership of al-Qaida and eliminating the greatest political threat and the most serious terrorist threat to our homeland. That is what our amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the Senate will once again agree to this amendment and establish this as a preeminent priority for this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the leader. We were rushed, and I didn't have a chance to explain what I was trying to do.

I have seen other Republican bills, such as David Vitter's, taken down because it violated rule XVI, legislating on an appropriations bill. Yet when I heard Senator Dorgan's amendment, I realized there was a double standard. We were  being inconsistent. It was OK to legislate on a Democratic bill but not a Republican bill.

    <paragraph>I had asked for the yeas and nays on appealing the ruling of the Chair because that was my intent, to question whether we should be legislating on appropriations bills. That was more of a vote on rule XVI than it was the Dorgan amendment. That is what I was here for, to ask for a vote on appealing the ruling of the Chair,  which was my language: "I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas and nays."</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada and others were in the well a moment ago when Senator DeMint indicated what he wanted was a vote on my amendment. I said that is fine, withdraw your objection and we will have a vote on my amendment. Apparently, that is not what he wanted because the Senator offered an objection relative to rule XVI. The Chair sustained the Senator's objection, and because the Senator won, he was not satisfied and wanted to do something further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have the foggiest idea what might be the motivations here. If the Senator from South Carolina wants a vote on my amendment, all he has to do is withdraw his objection, and we can have a vote in 30 seconds. If there is some other nefarious purpose here, then maybe the Senator might explain it to us.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, that is why I said I think we are kind of in a twilight zone here. The Chair is not partisan. The Parliamentarians who serve at our pleasure, Democrats and Republicans, are not partisan. They go by the rules and the precedents set in this body.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be happy to yield to my friend. I will say to my friend, he and I were on this floor and we danced this tune once before. It took us 4 years to unwind from it. That is why the vote yesterday was so important.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is what I wish to comment on, Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield briefly. Without getting into the substance or without questioning anybody's motives, it is important that we understand--and I can put this in the form of a question to the majority leader--if, in fact, this appeal of the ruling of the Chair should succeed, that would do away with rule XVI, as I understand it, and then we would all have a grand old time legislating on appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the leader responds, let me say there are pent-up feelings on this side, probably on your side: Well, we can't get the authorizations and some of the language we want and the appropriations bills may be about the only thing moving through here, in some respects, and we want to have an opportunity to legislate on appropriations bills. But here is part of my concern, honestly. I don't think we can win that battle against the other side. I suspect you all would wind up legislating more than  we would on appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think we need to calm down around here. There is a rule on the books for a reason. For good reason we took an action that knocked it out a few years ago. I learned painfully what a mistake that was. We should not be legislating on appropriations bills. You can make a good-faith effort around here if you want to do that. I think this action would cause some consequences we would not want, if we look at it in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Am I stating this correctly, I ask the majority leader?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our roles were reversed too many years ago when I had his job and he had my job, and it was a very difficult time. Even everything being in order, to move these appropriations bills is hard, and then anybody can offer anything on them. The key to these appropriations bills is you deal with matters of appropriation, not some of the subjects people have thrown into them all the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend said, there is a lot of frustration. The House can move a lot of authorizing legislation. We cannot over here. So there is a tremendous temptation to stick in these appropriations bills all kinds of authorizing legislation that shouldn't be on appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I plead to my friend from South Carolina: It doesn't prove anything to have us vote on something--you have already won. I will also say this. The only partisan nature of raising points of order is we try--it usually works out that way--if there is a Republican who violates a point of order, a Democrat who is the manager of the bill will raise a point of order; if it is a Democrat, then a Republican will raise a point of order. That is the only partisan nature of raising points of order.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I feel a necessity at this point--and I will follow it with a question--to also say that I understand the right of the Senator from South Carolina to do this procedure. I am not questioning that at all. I think the result would be one that would not be good for the institution, and I think we would be abusing it on both sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But also I want to emphasize the right of a Senator to modify his own amendment. I wasn't here when the discussions took place with regard to Senator Vitter's modifying of his own amendment, and I know that has caused some consternation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could say to the majority leader, wouldn't it be better for this institution if we would not get in the position of questioning each other's motives? I realize we have to be honest with each other, and I understand what everybody is doing. I understand the amendment on Osama bin Laden. Yes, we want to catch him, and I know there is a lot being done--and I won't get into the intelligence--and I understand what Senator DeMint is doing, but I would hope this would give  us an opportunity, in a bipartisan way, for the sake of this institution, to step back, to calm down, and to stop trying to do these things to each other on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grandstanding, and I apologize, but my purpose is to try to say to the institution, to our people, I hope we will find a way to avoid this. I think it would be a mistake, and I assume the majority leader agrees with that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, calling on his years of experience, to try to settle things down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say that, perhaps with Senator Vitter, giving him the benefit of the doubt, maybe there was a misunderstanding in the conversation. That is totally possible. Maybe he didn't understand the rules. Maybe he didn't do one thing and say something else, and I accept that, if in fact that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think what we should do is, I am going to ask a quorum call be started, and then we will huddle over here and see if we can work all this out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, due to the good work of my friend from Mississippi and others, on both sides, here is what we are going to do. There has been a point of order raised against the Dorgan amendment, and that has been sustained. So that amendment will fall. And in the order of amendments filed, Senator Vitter's is at No. 11 or 12; OK?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Vitter, when he had his conversation with Senator Cochran, Senator Murray, and me, was under the impression he could still modify his amendment. We thought differently. It was just a misunderstanding. Maybe we have been around here too long--I shouldn't say "we." Maybe I have been around here a long time and just accept things for the way they appear to be and not sometimes the way they are. Senator Vitter has said there was nothing nefarious in what  he did. He just assumed he could automatically modify that. And under the rules, he could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will go back right where we were. No one is accusing Senator Vitter of anything that is illegal or unethical. It was simply a misunderstanding among the four of us. So anything I have said earlier today, based on my misunderstanding of him and what his thoughts were, just forget about them because based on the conversation I have had with him in the last few minutes, that wasn't the case. So I shouldn't have been as upset, and  Senator</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I appreciate those words very much, and I certainly want to reiterate that I never thought I was waiving what I considered my ability as a Senator to modify my own amendment and try to get a vote on my own amendment in the form I would like. So I appreciate the comments of the leader in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to point out that I was actually modifying the amendment in order to get rid of this point of order and the fact that it, in a previous form, would have legislated on an appropriations bill, which we are trying to avoid. So I was trying to avoid that with regard to my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I appreciate the comments, and I look forward to moving forward.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, let me say, I haven't mentioned his name but, of course, the distinguished Republican leader, being involved in this little huddle that took place, had a tremendous influence on our ability to work this out. I would say--and I hope I don't jinx anything we are working on now--what I would really like us to do is to see if in the foreseeable future we can work out a time on this bill for final passage. No one has had any amendments being prohibited. If people  don't want to have final passage in the next 24 hours or so, that's fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before, I don't want to file cloture. We can just keep grinding through the weekend, but I would rather not do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometime today we are going to see if we can move to the conference report that Senator Lieberman has so masterfully brought back to us dealing with the 9/11 Commission recommendations. He, of course, worked with Senator Inouye and others to get this done, and so we will do that at a later time. But I wish everyone would work--certainly the two managers of the bill--to see when would be an appropriate time to see about a time for final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember, we have this bill to complete. We have to work on children's health. We have two conference reports--there may be three conference reports--and that is all we have to do. But we have to go through all the procedural hurdles, and that may take longer than any of us wants to get through in the next few days.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I also thank the majority leader and Senator Vitter for the colloquy we just heard. I think it is entirely possible for us to conduct our business in a civil fashion. I think we have just experienced a good example of the Senate working together on a bipartisan basis to get back together and to begin to move forward and finish this bill as soon as possible.

  <chair> Is there objection to the unanimous consent request propounded by the Senator from Louisiana?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I can appreciate the situation we are in with the point of order being raised against the amendment, but as you know, Mr. President, I offered this amendment in good faith last night and spoke at some length on the amendment. I was under the impression that before we voted I would have the opportunity to speak on the amendment. Since that didn't happen, I appreciate the goodwill of my colleagues to at least allow me 5 minutes to speak, although the amendment  has a point of order called against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment actually proposes $25 million on this appropriations bill. I don't know where else to appropriate money except on an appropriations bill, and that is basically what my amendment does. It is a two-page bill, and it appropriates $25 million to the CIA to give them some extra resources to try to track down the No. 1 terrorist and his network that is threatening our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment was prompted not out of politics or spite, it was prompted out of last week's National Intelligence Estimate that has been referred to now several times on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This did not come from a Democratic think tank or a Republican think tank, it came from the National Intelligence Estimate that says the al-Qaida network is as strong as it was before 9/11 and that Osama bin Laden is still the No. 1 target.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered an amendment in good faith and reached out to my colleagues to say we are on homeland security, could we find $25 million to appropriate some additional funding to the CIA? I know there are other resources, some of them are classified and some of them are not--and to clearly restate the policy that Osama bin Laden remains the foremost objective of the United States in the global war on terror and protecting the U.S. homeland, the foremost is to capture and kill Osama bin Laden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the point of order. I understand technically the Parliamentarian would probably rule against me.  But for the purposes of the constituents I am representing I wish to say I am trying but am blocked to appropriate $25 million more on a Homeland Security bill to give it to the CIA to help protect us from the No. 1 terrorist, according to our intelligence reports. That is all I wished to say.</paragraph>

I am offering the amendment with several cosponsors, including Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Warner, and Senator Voinovich.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment would provide $300 million in funding to the States to implement the program known as REAL ID. It is offset with a .8-percent across-the-board cut in the rest of the bill. The total pricetag of the rest of the bill, the Homeland Security appropriations bill, is about $37.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will have a word to say about the offset in a moment. I know the Senator from Washington will have a few more words to say about the offsets when her time comes. I would prefer another offset, but I will talk about that a little later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me describe again what the amendment does. I would ask the Chair if I can be informed when 10 minutes has expired.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator will be so notified.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, after 9/11, the 9/11 Commission recommended that in light of the terrorism our country faces, we begin to study how we can have more secure identification cards. A number of the terrorists had stolen cards or had fraudulent cards or had ID cards that were not real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of that, the Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act at the end of 2004 which established a process by which we could look at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. It established a negotiated rule-making process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because most of the ideas about ID cards involved State and local governments, all of them involved issues of privacy, all of them involved the possibility of great inconvenience to most Americans, this negotiated rule-making process would basically create a seat at the table for representatives of all the affected groups and try to work out the most sensible thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have historically been opposed to the idea of an ID card. When I was Governor of Tennessee, I twice vetoed the photo driver's license bill because I thought it was an infringement on liberty. But the legislature overrode me, I accepted it, and today, after 9/11, I agree it would be wise for our country, with a combination of terrorism and the difficulties within immigration, to have more secure identification cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, which one? Then suddenly, in 2005, along came an appropriations bill for our troops, and in the middle of it, the House of Representatives stuck something called the REAL ID Act, which set minimum standards for State driver's licenses as an effort to deter terrorists from easily obtaining that form of identification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that could be a good idea. But there are 245 million Americans with driver's licenses or ID cards. Many of us send those in by mail or online to renew them. Last year in the State of Tennessee, for example, there were 1.7 million driver's licenses issued. There are 53 driver's license identification stations. I believe the only group of people who could have passed REAL ID in the dead of the night, without any hearings, were Congressmen who had never been to a driver's license examining  station in Tennessee or maybe in their own State, because these are not State employees who are trained in catching terrorists. They are not equipped to deal with the large number of new responsibilities, in a State which is going to have REAL ID, that include having to come in person to that driver's license office and show a number of documents, including the Social Security card and a valid U.S. passport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would have to prove, I would have to prove, that I am lawfully a citizen of the United States. Our family has been here for 12 generations. Senator Salazar has been here for 13 generations. The Presiding Officer has written a book about the number of generations his family has been here. We would have to go down to one of these driver's license stations and prove we belonged here. Nobody else ever had to do that before in my family that I know about. But in an age of terrorism, we  might have to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the very least, I would think we would want to do one of two things: One would be that in the Senate, in the Homeland Security Committee or other appropriate committees, we might want to think about whether there might be other ways to come up with a better secure identification card, rather than add that to the burden of the driver's license.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, most of the problems that surround the immigration bill have to do with work, people coming into this country illegally to get a job. That is what most of it is about. Senator Schumer and Senator Graham have a piece of legislation that would create a secure Social Security card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I wonder if, over a period of years, having workers with a Social Security card that is secure, includes biometrics, and a good employer verification system, might not be a more sensible way for us to improve the question of whether we have secure identification cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is the idea of more passports. Already we have a backlog because of the number of American who are getting a passport. But passports are a more  secure identification. Maybe there should be a secure travel card we could use when we travel on airplanes. For example, there are a couple million  of us at a time who are up in the air. If we all had one of those cards, you begin to add all those up--you may have some driver's licenses that are more secure, a secure work card, a passport and a travel card, a variety of secure cards would begin to avoid the terrors we imagine from a "Big Brother"  national ID card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We remember what happened with that sort of thing in Nazi Germany and in South Africa, where you had to carry around a wallet and a portfolio describing how mixed your blood might be so they can determine your race. We do not want that in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that would be the kind of discussion we should have had in hearings before any of this was adopted. We were going to have that with the negotiated rule-making process, before suddenly this so-called REAL ID card comes through here at night and we have to vote for it, up or down, or not send any money to support the troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can get an idea of what the REAL ID surge might cost by looking at what is happening right now with the passport backlog in the United States. There were 12 million passports issued in 2006. This year there are going to be 17 million because of new travel requirements. The Passport Office employees are working hard, but they grossly underestimated, or we did, what the new demand would be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, there was a backlog of 3 million passports in March. Today it is 2.3 million. The turnaround time used to be 6 weeks, now it is 12 to 14 weeks on regular service and 4 to 6 on expedited service. We have destroyed summer vacations, we have ruined weddings and honeymoon plans, we have disrupted business meetings and educational trips. People lost days of work waiting in line. If we think the passport backlog has created consternation, imagine what it is going to be like when 245 million  Americans, many who have been used to renewing their driver's licenses by mail, many who have thought of themselves and their parents and grandparents as good, legal Americans, have to go to their driver's license station with a pack of documents and prove they are legally here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they might get right up to the door and somebody says: You forgot one thing, and they have to go all the way back home, get it, and stand back in line again. I bet we get more calls on that than we did on immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another problem I would like to describe. It is one I am trying to address with this amendment. I am trying to provide three hundred million dollars next year to help States who wish to comply with REAL ID pay for it. Now, not all States will take advantage of this because 17 States have already</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska.) The Senator has used 10 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue with my time because I do not see Senator Collins or Senator Warner or Senator Voinovich. I will take another 4 or 5 minutes. If they don't come, then I will give back my time, except a minute or two to the Senator from Washington and let the Senator from Washington be recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me talk about the money a minute. Seventeen State legislatures, including Tennessee, have passed legislation against REAL ID. We do not want it. We want something else. But for those who do have it, they have to get cracking because it says here: States have to be ready to comply with these new measures by May of next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has not even issued final regulations about what the compliance must be. But the Department, thanks to the good work of Senator Collins and others with an amendment we had earlier this year, has agreed to grant waivers to States for delayed implementation. So States have a little bit of time to work on this, if they choose to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But 17 States do not want to. However, we have a principle here called federalism. Much of it is incorporated in the 10th amendment to the Constitution. I see our constitutional expert, the Senator from West Virginia, on the floor. When I was Governor, I said on the floor many times, nothing made me madder than when some Congressman or Senator would stand up with a big idea, pass it, hold a press conference taking credit for it, and send the bill to me. I would have to either raise tuition or  cut this or change that, and then that same Congressman would be home making a big speech about local control the next weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did not like that. It was called unfunded Federal mandates. I have also stated many times on this floor that the Republican Congress got elected in 1994 running against these mandates. They stood on the steps of the Capitol in 1994 with Newt Gingrich. They said: No more unfunded mandates. If we break our promise, throw us out. Maybe that is one of the reasons they did throw us out, because we forgot that promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We forget it with REAL ID because, according to the National Governors Association, implementing it would cost $11 billion over 5 years. The Department of Homeland Security itself expects the cost to reach $20 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Federal Government has appropriated only $40 million for the States to comply with those mandates, even though it could cost $20 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not supposed to be doing that. If we want to require it, we should pay for it. My view of unfunded mandates is we ought to either fund REAL ID or we ought to repeal it. We should not require it unless we are going to pay for it. I see the Chair, the distinguished former Governor himself, the Senator from Nebraska. When I described how I felt about unfunded mandates as Governor of Tennessee, I imagine he felt exactly the same way. I have sought, working with Senators Collins, Warner,  Voinovich, and Kyl, to identify a way to begin to deal with this issue of the unfunded Federal mandate. That is where this $300 million amendment comes from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Governors Association met last weekend. They issued the following statement regarding REAL ID:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress is truly committed to transforming REAL ID into a reasonable and workable law that actually increases the security of our citizens, it must commit the Federal funds necessary to implement this Federal mandate. As the Senate considers the Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008, the Nation's Governors urge Senators to support Senator Alexander's efforts to begin funding the mandates imposed by REAL ID. States estimate the cost of REAL ID will exceed $11  billion over 5 years, including $1 billion in up-front costs merely to create systems and processes necessary to implement the law and prepare to re-enroll all 245 million driver's license and identification cardholders. To date Congress has appropriated only $40 million to assist States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I only have one more point to make. Then I will yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member allowed me to discuss this and bring up this amendment during committee deliberations. I thank them for that. I offered offsets from other funds that States were receiving. A majority of the members of the committee didn't like the offsets. That is not so unusual in the world in which we live. My amendment was defeated in the Appropriations Committee. I am coming to the floor with a different offset. It is 0.8 percent across  the board cut in the rest of the bill. I know very well that the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the subcommittee and other Senators don't like that offset, but I suggest to my colleagues that there are others of us who don't like underfunded Federal mandates. If the Congress is going to impose on the States a $20 billion cost over 10 years, then we should pay for it. We have only appropriated $40 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Governors said, it is time for us to move ahead and appropriate $300 million this year, only a downpayment on what we should pay, and if the offset we adopt today is not the one the chairman and others would prefer, then perhaps there is an opportunity during conference on an this appropriations bill of $37.6 billion to make that adjustment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the managers of the bill for giving me a chance to bring the amendment to the floor. I will yield the floor and wait to see if Senator Collins or others decide to come. If they do not come, I will yield back the rest of my time except for 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from West Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the very able Senator from Tennessee  for his amendment. It highlights another shortcoming in the President's budget. When it comes to homeland security, the President--and I speak most respectfully of the President; I always do--likes to rob Peter to pay Paul. Regrettably, in an effort to help States deal with the cost of REAL ID, the able Senator proposes to do the same thing. The able Senator proposes to do the same  thing by using an across-the-board cut. I don't like across-the-board cuts. That cuts into programs that hit a lot of people, all good people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to oppose the amendment. The President's budget fails to address the mandate imposed on States by the REAL ID Act. According to the National Governors Association, it will cost States $11 billion to implement the REAL ID Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the budget did not include one thin dime to help the States with this Federal mandate. Meanwhile, the Department has let $35 million which Congress appropriated in 2006 for REAL ID implementation sit in the Federal Treasury unspent for almost 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that again: The Department has let $35 million--that isn't just chickenfeed--which Congress appropriated in 2006 for REAL ID implementation to sit in the Federal Treasury unspent for almost 2 years. I share the concern of the Senator that this law, which was jammed down Congress's throat in an unamendable war supplemental, will impose serious costs on our States. However, given that there is $35 million still sitting at the Department and that we have no request from the White House,  this bill is not the place to fix this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would hamper the Department's ability to secure the Nation. For example, this cut would result in the reduction of 416 transportation security officers at the same time air travel has been increasing approximately 3 percent each year and the TSO workforce has decreased or stayed flat each year. It would also occur at a time when the aviation sector is at a heightened alert status. Let me say that again: It would also occur at a time when the aviation sector is at a heightened alert  status. The Federal air marshals would reduce coverage of critical flights. The Coast Guard would be unable to respond to projected search-and-rescue cases, thus endangering the lives of citizens and property, interdict a projected increase in migrants,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget requested--and the committee supports--funding for 3,000 new Border Patrol agents. Furthermore, this reduction would cut that increase in agents to 24. Additionally, the National Guard forces currently supporting Operation Jump Start on the southwest border assisting the Border Patrol will begin leaving the border this summer. Once again, the Border Patrol will be forced to move agents back from the border to perform administrative duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the committee's bill includes funding to support a total of 4,000 new detention beds, bringing total detention beds to 31,500. Moreover, this reduction would cut that increase by 32 beds. Are you listening? Given that the average length of stay in a given detention bed is approximately 40 days, losing 32 beds means we have lost the space to detain approximately 300 illegal aliens annually. Are you still listening? We have spent the past 2 months debating immigration reform and the  need for detention beds. A cut like this turns that debate on its head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget requested and the committee bill supports funding of $1 billion--that is $1 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--for fencing infrastructure and technology along our still porous border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we have learned nothing during the debate on the immigration bill, it is that the American people and a majority of the Senate want to secure our borders. Let me say that again: If we have learned nothing during the debate on the immigration bill, it is that the American people and a majority of the Senate want to secure our borders. A cut like this moves us in the exact opposite direction. First responders' State formula grants would be cut below the fiscal year 2007 enacted level; ironically,  the level approved under a Republican-controlled Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practical implication of this will be: First responders will go without up-to-date personal protective equipment; fewer critical infrastructure facilities, including chemical and nuclear, will have a security buffer zone; public transportation, a known target by terrorists overseas, will be less secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thought the distinguished Senator from Tennessee made a very compelling argument about this amendment, which he has offered. We have heard him discuss his ideas on federalism, and there is no better proponent of clear thinking on that issue than the Senator from Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what occurred to me when I was sitting here is that I have heard some of these arguments before. I started thinking back to the hearings that were held and the markup sessions that were held in the Governmental Affairs Committee, the committee of legislative jurisdiction, when the Department of Homeland Security was being created by Congress to more effectively--with a better Federal organization of talent and wherewithal--cope with the challenges from threats to the security of our homeland.  Many of these issues were discussed in great detail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember the Senator from Connecticut, in particular, Mr. Lieberman, being in a position of leadership on the committee at that time. We had other talented Senators working on that authorizing legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is happening to us, I am afraid, is as we get about the business of implementing the changes in our laws that were made by the creation of this new Department, and the creation of new agencies to implement and carry out these responsibilities in a coherent way--the policymakers have their guidance from that legislation, but we now here are considering an appropriations bill. We are not at a point where we are going back and reviewing in an oversight hearing or in a consideration of changes  that ought to be made in the law. We are appropriating the funds to give to the Department and the agencies that were created and given these responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to come in now with an amendment--and I hate to argue against this amendment because the eloquent argument on its behalf was very impressive, but this is the wrong vehicle and this is not the right way to deal with the problem. If we have made an error in requiring too expensive, too stringent, too illogical, unworkable requirements or laws, let's change them. Let's change them. But let's not try in an Appropriations Committee to halfway fund our needs. We do not have the money to pay for  this program. That was pointed out very clearly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The REAL ID program is hugely expensive, and at some time there will be a day of reckoning. Maybe we are fast getting there. We have heard the warnings. I think we should heed the warnings and urge the legislative committee to think about modifying the authorities and the directives that are contained in the law--make it affordable, for one thing; decide, are State and local governments going to share the responsibility for these costs or is the Federal Government going to build up a huge Federal  deficit trying to pay for the costs on an annual basis through the annual appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, anyway, as my law school dean used to say, it is not a horse that is soon curried. This is something that is going to take some time and effort, and we need to rise to the challenge the Senator from Tennessee presents to us and come up with a more thoughtful and workable and affordable way to deal with this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am going to oppose the amendment because I think it should be done legislatively, and the problem cannot be solved with adding money and adding new language which is legislative in nature. I hope the Senate will carefully review the options we have and try to do the responsible thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the REAL ID Act was legislation forced through Congress as an add-on to the emergency supplemental bill passed in May 2005, without any Senate hearings  or debate, but the implications of the Act are enormous. In addition to numerous privacy and civil liberties concerns, REAL ID is an unfunded mandate that could cost the States in excess of $23 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As hearings in the Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee have shown, REAL ID is far from being ready for primetime. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has not even released final regulations directing the States on REAL ID implementation. With 260 million drivers in this country, I do not see how we could have the massive national databases required by REAL ID up and running in the next 5 years--much less in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, even though they are not even in production yet, REAL ID cards are rapidly becoming a de facto national ID card since they will be needed to enter courthouses, airports, Federal buildings, and now workplaces all across the country. In my opinion, REAL ID raises multiple constitutional issues whose legal challenges could delay final implementation for years, and we should not support the Alexander-Collins amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May, the Department of Homeland Security Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee expressed concern over several items in the REAL ID proposed regulations and said that they pose serious risks to individual privacy by: failing to establish a standard for protecting the storage of personally identifiable information; failing to provide methods for Americans to inquire or complain about the collection, storage, and use of personal information and remedy errors; failing to require notifying  consumers of information collection and use by the State; failing to require that individuals have a choice over secondary use of that information; and failing to assure that the information collected for a specific purpose is used only for that purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should not fund the REAL ID program until the Department of Homeland Security makes fundamental reforms to the program and stops forcing such onerous provisions on the States. In addition, with this amendment offset by an across-the-board cut from all DHS programs, I don't think we should be robbing from other critical Homeland Security accounts--where we have seen real gains in securing our country--to pay for just 1 percent of the floundering REAL ID program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>REAL ID is not popular in our States, and opposition spans the political spectrum, from the right to the left. A large number of States have expressed concerns with the mandates of the REAL ID Act by enacting bills and resolutions in opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen States have enacted statutes or resolutions against REAL ID, including Hawaii, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, New Hampshire, Maine, Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, Georgia, Oklahoma, Montana, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Maine have gone so far as to indicate that they intend to refuse to comply with REAL ID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten States have had statutes or resolutions pass one chamber of their legislature, including Oregon, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, Minnesota, Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another 10 States have had statutes or resolutions introduced in their legislatures, including Alaska, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reaction to the numerous privacy concerns and unfunded mandates of the REAL ID Act is a good example of what happens when the Federal Government imposes itself rather than working with the States to build cooperation and partnership. Since so many States have risen up in opposition to REAL ID, we should not fund this failed program, and I urge a "no" vote on this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Alexander amendment. It is a bad idea. The amendment would take away $300 million from port security, rail security, and all the grant programs that fund the first responders in each of our home States. It would rob the Border Patrol, Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard of the resources they need to keep our Nation safe. It would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would take $300 million and give it to departments of motor vehicles. Let me say that again. This amendment takes funds off the border, and gives funds to departments of motor vehicles. That is because the REAL ID Act will require every citizen to obtain a new driver's license from your State. To do that, you will need a birth certificate, your Social Security card, and some way of verifying your current address. It applies to everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will require States to reissue more than 245 million driver's licenses--let me say that again. It will require States to reissue more than 245 million driver's licenses--only after certifying that the person requesting the document is an American citizen or in the country legally. States are also being asked to build a whole new set of databases and other information technology to link up with the Federal database and with other States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All in all, the national ID system will cost $23 billion--with a "B"--$23 billion for the States to implement, and we are going to take away $300 million from port security and rail security and first responders in our home States and think that is going to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would only provide 1.3 percent of that $23 billion cost. That does nothing to help the States. In fact, it is an afront to them to say "we hear your complaints," and then provide them with a 1-percent solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the funding issues this amendment creates, endorsing REAL ID would be a real mistake. The REAL ID Act puts massive new Federal regulations on the States. From new databases and fraud monitoring, to new network and data storage capacity, the States will be tasked with an enormous range of new regulations and new requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once REAL ID becomes effective, every State's department of motor vehicles will have to play immigration official. DMV workers will be tasked with reconciling discrepancies in Social Security numbers with the Social Security Administration. Departments of motor vehicles will have to require proof of "legal presence" in the United States from immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>REAL ID also creates enormous privacy concerns. REAL ID is a national  ID card. Make no mistake about that. Every citizen who wants to get on a plane, who wants to enter a Federal building, and, possibly, who even wants to get a job will have to be a part of it. We should not be funding something such as that without a real debate in Congress about the wisdom of such a program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One month ago, 52 Senators voted to prohibit the expansion of REAL ID in the immigration bill. I hope we do not retreat from that progress by suddenly agreeing to this amendment to fund--at a 1-percent level--REAL ID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way to improve our country's homeland security is not by outsourcing it to the States' Department of Motor Vehicles. Our security is improved by hiring more border agents, strengthening Customs and the Coast Guard, and ensuring local law enforcement has the tools they need to prepare for and respond to terrorist threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment sets the wrong priorities for homeland security, and I urge its defeat.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I agreed with the last half of the Senator from Montana's statement, but the first half was an eloquent argument for a $20 billion unfunded mandate for the States of Montana and Nebraska and Tennessee and everybody else. If we are going pass it, we ought to fund it. And if we are not going to fund it, we ought to repeal it. That is my position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed the law in 1995, the Federal Unfunded Mandate Act, but the REAL ID program imposes on the States, according to the Department of Homeland Security, an up to $20 billion unfunded mandate. It will require up to 245 million of us to go in and prove we are lawfully here and stand in line at our driver's license offices. Seventeen States have said they don't like it, including mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Governors Association meeting in Traverse City, MI, last week generated a letter to all of us saying: If you are going to require it, fund it. That is what we are beginning to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you think the passport backlog is a big problem, wait until the driver's license backlog comes if we don't properly fund REAL ID or repeal it. There will be weddings. There will be vacations. There will be honeymoons. There will be trips. But there will be work days messed up. There will be a lot of mad Americans, and rightly so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this amendment would make a small installment payment of $300 million for the REAL ID program we imposed on the States. Surely the conference can find, in a $37.6 billion bill, $300 million to do what we are supposed to do. If we require it, we should fund it. The Republican Congressmen were right in 1994 when they said it, and if we can't remember that, they should throw us out.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="RULE XVI">
    <paragraph>Madam President, let me make one additional point I did not make earlier in the discussion in the Senate, and I think it is an important point to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a suggestion on the floor of the Senate by a Senator earlier that rule XVI has been applied in this Senate in a manner that was unfair. That is simply not the case. Every Senator has the right to raise the issue of rule XVI if someone is trying to legislate on an appropriations bill. It was done, as another Senator suggested, with respect to Senator Graham; it was done with respect to something they offered on the floor. Everyone has that right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me make this point: It is not unusual to legislate on an appropriations bill in circumstances where what is being done is something that is done almost by unanimous consent, a provision that everyone agrees with, a provision that is noncontroversial. That is  not unusual at all. That happens all the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am frankly surprised there is anyone in this Chamber who would disagree with the proposition that we ought to get quarterly classified, top-secret reports on what is happening to try to eliminate the al-Qaida leadership that apparently is now in a safe haven in the tribal area of Pakistan. I didn't expect that to be controversial. I didn't expect there would be one person in this Senate who would disagree with that. But, apparently, there is. He has that right. But it is an unfortunate  circumstance that we had a situation that allows, or a situation that persuades someone to stand up on the floor and say there is a double standard on rule XVI. There is no double standard. There is not one person in the Senate who believes that, outside of the person who said that. There is no double standard. The standard is applied in exactly the same way to every Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is unusual to me is objecting to the standard of allowing what normally would be uncontroversial, or noncontroversial provisions--including this one, saying it ought to be our top priority to eliminate the leaders of al-Qaida, and that the Administration should give Congress quarterly reports on what is being done to address the greatest terrorist threat to our country. I am flabbergasted. I am enormously surprised that would be controversial with anyone in the Senate. I would expect 100  Senators would agree with that proposition, but one, apparently, does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will have that debate again. We will have the debate at another time. As I said earlier, we have already added the same amendment to the Defense authorization bill. That was an amendable bill. That bill has been taken from the floor at this point, but I assume it will come back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did wish to make the point on behalf of every Senator, except the person who said this, that there is no double standard on rule XVI. Those who suggest that, profoundly misunderstand, apparently, the rules of the Senate. But there should not be a misunderstanding in this Senate about the urgency of at least 99 Members of the Senate wanting to go after and eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. I would hope that would represent everyone's determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida is the terrorist organization that represents the greatest terrorist threat to this country, right now, according to the National Intelligence Estimate; and al-Qaida and its leaders are the ones who boasted about murdering 3,000 or more innocent Americans on 9/11/2001.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President. I have an amendment that I will offer at the appropriate time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, in this technological age of vehicle barriers, ground- based radar, camera towers, and unmanned aerial vehicles, I am pleased to note that the U.S. Border Patrol still guards America's southwest border in a timeless and very American manner, on horseback.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, sometimes these horses are injured or simply are no longer fit for such rigorous service. When that happens, the Border Patrol must make the decision to either put the horse out to pasture, or, in some cases, as the only humane option, to relieve the poor animal's suffering and put it to sleep. Before that happens, my amendment would ensure that the Border Patrol provides the trainer or handler of the horse with an opportunity to adopt it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple amendment. The Bureau of Land Management within the Department of the Interior already has a horse adoption program, which I encourage the Border Patrol to use as a model for creating its own program. My amendment would also ensure that such an adoption program includes appropriate safeguards to ensure that a horse, once adopted, is not sold for slaughter or treated inhumanely. This amendment would make 20 horses available for adoption per year within the Homeland Security  Department. It is the humane and decent thing to do for these noble animals which help to secure our borders and keep our citizens safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of my amendment when it is offered later today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to praise the work of Senator Byrd, Senator Inouye, Senator Cochran, Senator Stevens, Senator Murray, and the entire Appropriations Committee for the work they have done on the Homeland Security Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. This is a strong bill. It is an essential bill to protect our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our foremost duty here in the Congress is to make sure we are protecting America, and this bill is a significant step in the right direction. I agree with Senator Byrd and the majority leader that this must be the first appropriations bill for this fiscal year and that we must pass it this year. I hope we will pass it later today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A government's primary responsibility is in the protection of the homeland and keeping its citizens safe from attack. This bill will help us secure our borders, train and support our first responders, prevent the transport of nuclear materials, and strengthen our defenses against terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need not look far to understand the threats that face this country. September 11 brought the specter of terrorism to the front door of America. September 11 illustrated tragically and horribly the great threat extremist groups can pose to the United States. But September 11 is not the only terrorist attack we or our allies have endured in recent times. In 2002, a bomb in Bali killed 202 people and wounded 209. In 2004, bombs on trains in Madrid killed 191 people and wounded over 2,000. In  2005, attacks on London's Underground killed 52 commuters and injured 700. The list goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Department reports that the number of incidents of terrorism worldwide has grown dramatically in recent years. Between 2005 and 2006, the number of incidents rose from 11,000 to over 14,000. Three-fourths of these incidents resulted in death, injury, or kidnapping. All told, terrorism claimed the lives of more than 74,000 people around the world last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans today know that they are not immune from attack. We know America is not immune from attack. We also know violent extremism is posing a growing threat to our society and to that of our allies. Americans expect their Government to respond to these threats with adequate resources, sound policies, and strong leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our homeland is not as secure as it should be. A recent survey revealed that national security experts on both sides of the aisle agree that we have not come as far as we should have over the last 6 years. They agree that the Department of Homeland Security is underperforming. They agree that intelligence reform has not been effective. And they agree that too few resources are being allocated to the defense of our homeland and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reports of holes in America's armor, from inadequate rail security to insufficient funding for screening at ports, along with the Government's recent record of failed responses to national disasters, such as the bungled leadership of Hurricane Katrina to a lack of National Guard equipment when a tornado tore through the State of Kansas--those incidents underline the urgency of passing a strong and smart bill that funds our homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to briefly describe three ways in which the additional funding in this bill is vital for our security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the funding levels allow us to improve security at the border and to enforce our immigration laws. Just a few weeks ago, during our immigration debate on this floor, we all agreed that we must get control of our border and know who is coming into this country. Now it is time for us to walk the walk. The bill before us would allow us to hire additional Border Patrol agents to protect our borders. It also includes funds for additional border fencing, infrastructure, and technology to monitor  the vast open spaces we need to monitor and control. It also provides an additional $475 million for enforcement of customs and immigration laws within the United States. Our Nation is and must be a nation of laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I am proud that this bill supports our first responders--the firefighters, peace officers, nurses, and volunteers who rush in when others rush out. They serve us by devoting their time, their skills, their courage, and oftentimes their lives. We owe them the tools and resources they need to do their jobs. The bill before us provides money for State and local emergency preparedness programs, money for firefighter assistance grants in this program and funds for emergency performance grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased that this bill restores funds to our first responder and State training programs for law enforcement and firefighter operations that the President had proposed to cut. This bill, however, funds these provisions, and that includes $525 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, $375 million for law enforcement and terrorism prevention grants, $560 million for firefighter equipment grants, and $140 million to hire firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish also to note that the bill makes a serious investment in the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the crown jewel of training centers for the law enforcement community. A bipartisan group of us added a provision to the 9/11 Commission bill to create the Rural Policing Institute at FLETC to address the particular law enforcement needs of rural America. This was a need that I saw. It was very clear to me as attorney general for Colorado. The rural sheriffs and peace officers whom I spoke  with during all of the time that I was attorney general and in crafting the Rural Policing Institute legislation agreed that the Rural Police Institute would be a valuable addition to FLETC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $220 million in this bill for FLETC will help ensure that our peace officers continue to get the highest level of training they need as we deal with the reality we find in the post-9/11 world. It is going to be the eyes and ears and skills of the nearly 800,000 peace officers of America who will protect our homeland from the vicious kinds of attacks we saw in New York on 9/11, the vicious kinds of attacks that took 150-plus lives in Oklahoma City some years ago. So we must do everything we  can to support our men and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>women who are in law enforcement at both the local and State level. This legislation does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in addition to providing better protection along our borders and ports and more tools for law enforcement and first responders, this bill helps us to prepare to recover from an attack or a disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina sounded the alarm bells for all of us. Unfortunately, not everyone seems to have heard them. Not only  does FEMA need better leadership and serious Congressional oversight, but it now needs the resources to do this job. The bill before us would provide $6.9 billion for emergency preparedness and response activity. That is a significant amount of additional money beyond what the President requested. Almost half of  those dollars would go out to States and local preparedness programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the bipartisan leadership which Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran, Senator Murray, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and the other members of the Appropriations Committee have shown on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is right that this is the first appropriations bill that we consider because our homeland security must come first before everything else. The threat of attack on our soil is as great as it ever has been, and this bill is an important step toward ensuring America's first responders have the tools and the equipment and training they need to keep America safe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This is serious business. I compliment the Senator on the manner in which he is carrying out his duties as a new member of this body--relatively new member.

    <paragraph>In the course of the immigration debate, it became clear that one of the issues about interior enforcement that was so difficult for us to get our arms around was the issue of identifying who was here. It was the issue of duplicative Social Security numbers and cards and the ease with which those intent upon breaking the law could fraudulently create a Social Security card. It seems to me the time  has come for us to consider a biometric  Social Security card. It would be a Social Security card that would fix this problem for interior enforcement and one that would be a foundational step toward having the kind of serious interior enforcement the American people want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things we heard over and over is, why don't we enforce the current law. The reason we cannot enforce current law is because there isn't a national way in which we can identify who is here legally and who is not when they apply for a job. It isn't fair to put employers in a position of employing someone about whom they may wonder whether they are here legally but that they wouldn't know because there is no verifiable way of finding out. They also would have no way of knowing whether  in fact the card they were being presented was a real one or a fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would make substantial steps in securing and improving the employee verification system. This amendment would allow employers and employees alike to be sure their employment was lawful. It would provide a card with a photograph of every lawful guest worker, permanent resident or citizen that matches up with a photograph on file with the Social Security Administration or the Department of Homeland Security. It would also allow for phasing in this new card over a period of 10 years, upon which  only biometric Social Security cards or a U.S. passport or green card would be valid for employment authorization purposes. It does not affect the use of driver's licenses for establishing identity. It does not become a national ID card. Rather, this amendment only addresses the use of the Social Security card which we already use and sets standards to protect against</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding is this amendment, if offered today, would be subject to a rule XVI. It does in fact attempt to legislate and attempts to correct a serious problem we face in the country today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is an amendment in which the senior Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, joins as a cosponsor. It is one that is tremendously important to make sure we have the best security for our Nation we can possibly have. The concept of this amendment is straightforward. It directs Homeland Security dollars to areas where the threat of attack by terrorists is the greatest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was no accident that when the terrorists attacked our Nation on September 11, they picked powerful, high-profile and heavily trafficked targets. Terrorists target areas where they can inflict the most damage and get the most attention. For those reasons, they focus on urban areas and areas of national importance or those that are, naturally, highly populated. One of the things that often gets overlooked is when you look at only the population in a certain place, oftentimes we overlook places  such as Florida. In Florida, we have 70 million people from all over the world and certainly from all over the United States who visit as tourists. During any given day there are hundreds of thousands of tourists all over the State of Florida. This only adds to the population of our State at any given point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 18, 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a no-fly zone over the Walt Disney world resort area because, according to the FAA, the Disney parks are a potential target of symbolic value. In a similar instance, Port Everglades in Broward County actually has more passengers, freight, and people moving through it than even the port of Miami. All of the cruise ships, tankers, and shipping traffic out of the Miami area actually sail from Broward County. These examples highlight  the issues associated with regional influx. They underscore the need for additional security resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The whole State of Florida, in fact, now plays host to 77 million tourists a year. That is on top of the 17 million persons who call Florida home. We cannot overstate the importance of regional concepts and that models created by this amendment will encourage funding to be spent not only on our major cities but also on those regional centers that require by their nature special protections. On this issue, the Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has weighed in with a consistent message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a letter the Secretary says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding our first responders based on risk and need gives us the flexibility to ensure our finite resources are allocated in a prioritized and objective manner. The Department of Homeland Security strongly supports authorization language that would distribute Federal homeland security grant funds based on risk and need, rather than on static and arbitrary minimums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I do not intend to pursue this amendment and would in a moment ask that it be withdrawn. My understanding is that the 9/11 bill, the bill that gives life to many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, is going to be accepted or is going to be voted on and accepted by the Senate. In that bill there will be a much better distribution of dollars in a way that is more in keeping with the risks our Nation faces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that in mind, I will at this time ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The amendment is withdrawn.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wish to take an additional moment to speak about amendment 2404 which will be considered later today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many other countries, including Israel, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, have successfully demonstrated how an international registered traveler program can work to ensure security, focus attention on lesser known travelers, and provide a smoother and more predictable travel schedule for repeat travelers. Amendment No 2404 attempts to create an international registered travelers program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would authorize the Department of Homeland Security to establish an international registered traveler program to expedite the inspection of frequent U.S. and international travelers arriving by air into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary of Homeland Security is accordingly authorized to impose a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with establishing and maintaining such an expedited inspection process and is tasked to coordinate such a program with the Department of State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Transportation Security Administration and private industry developed the Registered Traveler program here in the U.S. to provide expedited security screening for passengers who volunteer to undergo a TSA-conducted security threat assessment in order to confirm that they do not pose or are not suspected of posing a threat to transportation or national security. It has been quite successful. I believe this is something that can work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we can create an international version, it will go a long way in helping to develop more strategic ties with our allies abroad and show openness to investment and travel in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We fight all the time for travelers who have options to travel anywhere in the world to come to our country to be tourists. Certainly tourism areas in our country such as Florida, but like many others, Washington, DC, New York City, many national parks out West, many of the beautiful areas of our States are natural attractions for foreign travelers. But the foreign traveling public has options of where to go. Part of the decisionmaking process is cost and ease of traveling. I believe this is  a well-thought-out amendment which will enhance our national security while at the same time allowing travelers to more easily find their way to our country in order to enhance the travel and tourism industry, which is of great importance in terms of our own tourism dollars, which keep many Americans employed.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The amendment is withdrawn.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what I believe we should do, and the purpose of the amendment that I offered and am hoping we will be able to get accepted in some fashion, is modest, but it is an important step. It will require that $51 million be set aside in the underlying bill that is before us today for section 287(g) training; that is, training State and local law enforcement officers to be of assistance to Federal immigration officers, and that $2.5 million of the $51 million could be used  to reimburse State and local training expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are 65 pending training agreements out there right now, some of which are being executed and some of which are waiting to be executed. I would like to explain why I think this is important, fair, and commonsensical. It is something we should do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 133 of the Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 is codified as section 287(g), the Immigration and Nationality Act, the INA, and it has commonly been known as the 287(g) program. Under this program, States and localities can ask the Department of Homeland Security to enter into a memorandum of understanding. That is like a treaty between the State and the Department of Homeland Security. They enter into these agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Presiding Officer, as a former U.S. attorney, knows how these MOUs are. They enter into these agreements, and the agreements essentially provide that their local law enforcement officers be cross-trained to work with Customs enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program clearly has not expanded at the pace we originally envisioned, but the tide is beginning to turn as to these issues and how we deal with the problem of illegal aliens. So today the number of illegal aliens in the United States is a staggering number. It is estimated at between 10 million to 12 million, with another estimated 800,000 arriving in our country each year. Last year, we arrested over 1 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One solution to address the problem is to increase partnerships between Federal immigration authorities and State and local authorities through such programs as the 287(g) program. It is something I know a little bit about. I was a U.S. attorney in Alabama for 12 years. I was attorney general for 2 years, and I traveled around the State and met with local law enforcement officers as attorney general and as U.S. attorney. Since I have become a Senator, I have asked them about how things work if  they apprehend somebody they believe to be illegally in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell my colleagues what they tell me without virtually any exception, except as we are seeing through this 287(g) program. But, fundamentally, what they have been telling me is they let them go. That is not just true in Alabama; it is true all over America. Local law enforcement officials who apprehend people they have every reason to believe--maybe absolute proof--that they are here illegally routinely are allowing the people they apprehend--maybe it is DUI, maybe it is for an accident  or whatever, a domestic dispute--whatever it is, they are letting them go because somehow they have gotten the message that nobody will come and pick them up, and they don't know how to do it or who to call and what the processes are. That is what the 287(g) program is designed to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it has been odd to me since I have sought to do something about this for quite some time, well before the comprehensive immigration reform bill was introduced in this Senate over a number of years ago to deal with it, there is always an objection. It was out of that objection that I made the comment one time that people will vote for any kind of immigration reform, as long as it is a reform that would not work. If you produce something that will actually work and actually help the system  get better and more lawful, somebody objects. It becomes a big deal. So I think this is a commonsensical thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our State and local officers are in the best position on a daily basis to come in contact with those unlawfully present here. We don't have Federal ICE agents, immigration agents throughout the country. Border Patrol people are just on the border. If you can get past the border--and that is one of the attractions of trying to get past the border--if you can get past it, you have a pretty good chance of being home free for some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have about 5,000 Federal ICE immigration agents inside our country, but only about 2,000 of those are actively involved in enforcement operations. We have 600,000 to 800,000 State and local law enforcement officers, sheriffs, police officers, State troopers. They are out there on the roads every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this bill and the training it provides on a 287(g) does not train and does not ask that the State and local officers do anything they don't want to do. They will not be compelled to participate in anything they choose not to participate in. It is a voluntary participation agreement. They are not called upon to participate in conducting raids to try to identify and find people who might be here illegally. Our goal would be to provide a situation in which they could assist the ICE officers  during the course of their ordinary duties. If they come upon someone likely to be an illegal alien, they would take the proper steps, after they have been trained, to identify whether they are, in fact, illegal and take the appropriate steps in  conjunction with ICE to handle it in the proper manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of an interest I had in it for some time, the State of Alabama, I am proud to say, became the second State in the Nation to enter into one of these agreements. Our Governor, Bob Riley, thought it was the right thing to do. He is an excellent Governor. He took steps to do it some years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, we have trained 60 State troopers in 3 classes of 20 each, and the Federal Government trained these troopers at the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, AL. But let me tell my colleagues what happened to the State as a result of their partnership and willingness to assist the Federal Government. They have to pick up the costs of this training. Each class costs Alabama an average of $40,000, for a total of $120,000 in State money, all designed to help ensure that our State troopers  are knowledgeable on all of the correct, fair, just, and legal ways to deal with illegal entrants into our country, and to be able to assist the Federal agents in doing their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one reason we have seen a fairly slow expansion of the 287(g) program is the fact that it costs the States a bunch of money. Now we have $51 million set aside here in this program for training. But they are not paying any of it, apparently, as of this date to refund the States for their costs of training. It takes some number of weeks in this training--more than I think is justified. It is 6 weeks, my counsel tells me. It is 6 weeks that they have to go through a training program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to tell my colleagues, if you go through any town in the country, whether it is Alabama or anywhere else, and you are a Senator, and you are speeding through that town and you are drunk, some 19-year-old, 20-year-old police officer can put you in jail, put your rear end in the Bastille. He doesn't have to have special training on how to arrest a Senator. But we are going to give special training to our local police officers on how to arrest somebody who is not even a citizen of the United  States of America. That is what Homeland Security wants and that is what they believe. Six weeks, in my view, is too much, for heaven's sake. But they want 6 weeks of training and they make them cross designated and very intense partners in this program. But if you take a police officer off the streets for 6 weeks, that is a drain on the State and local police departments, and we ought to be able to compensate them some for it, in my view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what happened in my State. It has been rather remarkable. In the first 18 months of operation, the Alabama MOU has resulted in the seizure of over $689,000 in cash in connection with criminal immigration offenses. Pretty good action there. As of last year, the training of those troopers had already resulted in 54 indictments, including those for illegal entry, false claims to citizenship, fraudulent documents, and visa fraud. It resulted in 33 convictions, including Social Security  fraud, prior deported aggravated felons, and visa fraud. These are in Federal Court, not State court. You cannot try people in State court for immigration offenses. They are picked up by the Federal prosecutors and they have to meet some seriousness standard before they would actually be prosecuted in Federal Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to those I mentioned, there are six Federal charges pending disposition, including aliens with firearms. There are 13 Federal charges pending indictment. So this is a matter that has the potential to help us identify those who are here illegally and those who may pose a threat to our country. It could well be that the next person planning an attack somewhere in the United States may be one of those picked up because, as we know, of the 18 hijackers, several of them were picked up--some  more than once--by State and local officers. But they had no way to access or did not access the actual history of these individuals to find out whether they were here legally and might otherwise be subject to arrest. If that had occurred and our system had worked effectively, it is conceivable that the case could have been broken before 9/11 occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission did point out that we need to do a far better job in this area. The 9/11 Commission recommended we implement State and Federal training and law enforcement cooperation and enhance that ability. That was one of their firm recommendations. We have not done that to any significant degree at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first State to be accepted with an MOU was Florida. They also have a history of an effective program under 287(g). The ICE program provides local law enforcement with comprehensive training and, once certified, the officers remain basically under ICE's supervision under all matters relating to immigration. To address concerns voiced by immigrant interest groups, Federal, State, and local enforcement have engaged in significant outreach efforts with local immigrant communities and have not  engaged in sweeps for undocumented aliens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the greatest testaments to the success of a program is that in no instance has a complaint been filed against law enforcement officers as a result of the actions under this memorandum of understanding. It has gone extremely well without the kind of complaints that people have suggested might happen, and it has been an asset to the Federal Government and should be continued. It is already part of our law. We have provisions that allow for it. We  have money set aside--$51 million in one area and $5 million in another area--but we don't have provisions to help the States defray the cost of their training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I will remind my colleagues of some of the objective reports since 9/11 that are important to us. One is the Hart-Rudman report. The report is entitled "America Still Unprepared--America Still in Danger." They found that one problem America still confronts is that "700,000 local and State police officers continue to operate in a virtual intelligence vacuum, without access to terrorist watchlists." The first recommendation of the report was to "tap the eyes and ears of local and State  law enforcement officers in preventing attacks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On page 19, the report specifically cited the burden of finding hundreds of thousands of fugitive aliens living among the population of more than 8.5 million illegal aliens living in the United States. They suggested that the burden could and should be shared with the 700,000 local, county, and State law enforcement officers if they can be brought out of the information void.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, the 9/11 Commission, released in the summer of 2004, also recognized the important role of State and local law enforcement officers in immigration law enforcement. Again, let me remind you, we have only a couple of thousand actively engaged Federal investigators inside our country to actually enforce immigration law. So how do we expect to intercept some of the individuals who may be plotting this very moment  to attack? They may be here with false documents, or they may have gotten into the country legally and overstayed. How are we going to find them if we don't welcome the participation of State and local law enforcement officers? In the 9/11 Commission report, the section titled "Immigration Law and Enforcement," the Commission found this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[T]oday, more than 9 million people are in the United States outside the legal immigration system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say it is 12 million, but they say more than 9. Nobody can dispute that. They continue:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a growing role for State and local law enforcement agencies. They need more training and work with Federal agencies so they can cooperate more effectively with those Federal authorities. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To achieve that necessary collaboration, we must first clarify the authority delegated to each level of law enforcement and make it clear that State and local officers have authority to and are welcome to participate actively in the enforcement of immigration law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment will do that. It is something that is overdue, and we should do it. I remain a bit baffled by the objections that continue to be raised on this. I had occasion last year to participate with my chief counsel, who is here with me--Cindy Hayden--to prepare a law review article for the Stanford Law Review on the question of the authority of State and local law enforcement officers. It is somewhat complex, but it is not disputed that State and local law enforcement have the authority  to detain people who  have come into our country illegally across our borders. They cannot prosecute them. They can detain them only for a reasonable period of time. They have to turn them over to Federal agencies. But they are able, with regard</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is somewhat confused is that we have perhaps 40 percent of the people enter into our country legally, but overstay. Maybe that large a percentage of our illegal population are visa overstays. The Court of Appeals in California--our Nation's clearly most liberal, the Ninth Circuit--concluded that local officers do not have the authority to detain those visa overstayers. If you break across the border, that is clearly a criminal offense and detention can be had for that, they say, but not  for the others. Two other circuits--the Tenth and Fifth--seem to indicate otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Justice did a memorandum at one point that said there was not authority for the detention of people in our country who have not committed criminal violations of immigration law. Then that opinion was withdrawn. So the matter is confusing. There was an article in the Washington Times newspaper about it yesterday. The article quoted one of the people as saying there are gray areas here. There was an article in the Huntsville, AL, newspaper about a meeting with the police and the  lawyers and the city council about what they could do to participate in the enforcement of laws with regard to those in our country illegally. The lawyers told them there is some confusion there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it is not hard for us to clear up that confusion. The House of Representatives tried to do it in their first bill last year, so they made it a felony to overstay and enter the country illegally. That resulted in an uproar and people saying we are going to make felons of them and that was awful, so there was a big retreat from that. We have to figure out the best way to proceed with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My view is two things need to occur. We need better training of our State and local law enforcement that goes into their existing power so they know what they are able to do and they don't overreach; second, we need to pass legislation. But this is an appropriations bill and we cannot legislate on an appropriations bill. We are not able to offer an amendment that would change or would clarify what the powers of the local law enforcement are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should make it quite clear that they have the power to detain anyone in our country illegally. They can detain a Governor. They can detain a mayor. They can detain a Senator. Why can't they detain somebody who is not a citizen and is in the country illegally?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do the American people think about this? Americans strongly value our heritage as a nation of immigrants. Americans openly welcome legal immigrants and new citizens. They value the character, the ability, the decency, and the strong work ethic of so many of those who have come to our country. However, it is also clear that Americans do not feel the same way about those who violate our laws. The fact is, a large majority feel that State and local governments should be aiding the Federal Government  in stopping illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Roper poll titled "Americans Talk About Illegal Immigration" found that 88 percent of Americans agree and 68 percent strongly agree that Congress should require State and local government agencies to notify INS, now ICE, and their local law enforcement when they determine that a person is here illegally or who has presented fraudulent documentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, 85 percent of Americans agree and 62 percent strongly agree that Congress should pass a law requiring State and local governments and law enforcement agencies to apprehend and turn over to the INS illegal immigrants with whom they come in contact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this amendment I have offered is far less reaching. Those numbers speak volumes about the instincts and the understanding of the American people about the enforcement of laws in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that these responses were collected in response to questions about requiring State and local law enforcement action. The amendment I have offered does not require that, although it is mightily frustrating to see cities and certain jurisdictions open, call themselves sanctuary bodies, and assert to the whole world that not only will they not help in any way to enforce the law but will, in fact, not cooperate with the enforcement of Federal laws in their jurisdiction. To  me that is inexcusable. It is an affront to our history as a lawful society, and I am troubled by it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the first step is we should do a better job of training local and State law enforcement officers, and, second, we should clarify their jurisdiction. If we do not do that, I don't think we are very serious about bringing under control illegal immigration in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did offer a second-degree amendment earlier, and I withdrew it. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to modify Senator Dole's amendment to include the language I proposed.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me thank both the majority leader and the Democratic manager of the bill, Senator Murray, for their work, for their amicable resolution of this issue. I think it is a very good bipartisan, productive, amicable result. I appreciate all of you working together in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also extend my thanks to Senator Cochran, the Republican manager of the bill, who was also very helpful in that regard in coming to a productive, amicable resolution. I appreciate all of that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to underscore the importance of what we have done because I think this is a very important issue for the people of Louisiana, for the people of the entire United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, on this very same bill, I joined with you, Mr. President, and we were successful in passing an amendment on the Senate floor, and then in the conference committee we were successful in passing a version of that out of the conference committee into law. That was an important step forward at the time to ensure we would not have Federal agents, we would not have the heavy hand, if you will, of the Federal Government coming down to rip out of people's grasp--U.S. citizens--pharmaceuticals  they had bought properly in Canada as they were coming back into our country. I think the policy of doing that in the past was outrageous, particularly considering the sky-high prices American consumers face in the United States and the very different lower prices they face in Canada. So that step forward a year ago was very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think what we just agreed to a few minutes ago, what will be on this bill, is an even more significant step forward because compared to what came out of conference and what was signed into law last year, this takes two additional steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we are no longer saying it is limited to prescription drugs on the person of an American citizen. What that means is that we are also including protection of Internet and mail order sales. That is enormously important for you, Mr. President, representing the State of Florida, and for me, representing the State of Louisiana. It is one thing for folks in Minnesota to travel to Canada and to come back; it is obviously a very different thing for folks in Florida or Louisiana to physically  travel to Canada and come back. So compared to what we got passed into law last year, this is far broader and far more significant because it also covers mail order and Internet sales.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second big difference is, again, what we passed last year was limited to a 90-day supply, and what we are passing on the Senate floor right now has no such limitation. Again, I think that is another significant step forward, a significant expansion of the law on the road to full-blown reimportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank everyone who was involved in this very productive resolution. We got a resounding vote a year ago--68 to 32. We got, technically, even a better vote today, in the sense that it was voice voted, unanimous consent, so technically unanimous. We got a much broader provision today, which I think is a very important step forward on the road to my ultimate goal, which is full-blown reimportation with all the requisite safety provisions and authorizing language that would be involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we cannot do that authorizing legislation on this bill because it is an appropriations bill, but we can, we should, we must, on another vehicle soon, very soon, absolutely this year. I look forward to continuing to work with you, Mr. President, with other leaders on this issue, Senator Snowe, Senator Dorgan, Senator Thune, Senator DeMint, and many others who completely support the ultimate objective of full-blown drug reimportation to allow American  consumers unbridled access to safe, cheaper prescription drugs, including by mail order and the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I believe the step we are taking here tonight, compared to what we were able to pass into law through the Vitter-Nelson amendment last year, is an important additional step in removing the limitation that it has to be on your person, so saying we can do it by mail order and the Internet, and by removing the limitation of a 90-day supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I again thank all of the participants for this very positive, amicable, bipartisan resolution of the issue on this bill. I look forward to continuing to walk down this path toward the ultimate goal I share with you and so many others on the Senate floor.</paragraph>

  <narrative> On page 69, after line 24, insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. 536.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or expended by the Secretary of Homeland Security to remove offenses from the list of criminal offenses disqualifying individuals from receiving a Transportation Worker Identification Credential under section 1572.103 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had an opportunity this morning to speak briefly about this amendment, and in the interest of time I will be brief again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is about the security of our ports. Two times within the last year this body passed a bill that would prohibit access to convicted felons of secure areas of our ports. We passed it once in the SAFE Port Act, and that amendment was diluted when it came back. Also, we will find in the 9/11 Commission bill that will come back--we had passed it and put it in as part of that bill--it has been once again diluted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This needs to be a serious consideration. We can spend billions and billions of dollars on screening and all kinds of equipment, but if one person in our ports turns away from something being shipped in and does not do the proper inspection and lets something in, we could be in a lot of trouble as a country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this amendment simply does not allow the Secretary to use funds to eliminate any of the felonies listed in the amendment. Please keep in mind, this list of felonies is one that has been adopted by the Homeland Security agency. It is very similar to the lists we use in our airports, which have protected us for a number of years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important we recognize that people who have been susceptible to criminal activity can be susceptible again. This is not that we do not want to give people a second chance, but second chances should not be at the expense of the security of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this amendment would disallow the use of funds to water down and eliminate any of the felonies listed in the Department of Homeland Security's list of those who are denied access to what we call the TWIC cards, which are the transportation worker identification cards.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Martinez and Senator Graham be added as cosponsors to this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="SECTION 2. APPROPRIATIONS FOR SECURING LAND AND MARITIME BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note at the outset this amendment is sponsored by Senator Menendez, myself, Senator Graham, and Senator Martinez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What it does, in a very simple statement, is say any funds we appropriate under this legislation with respect to our border security should be used to ensure the operational control that needs to be achieved for all our international land and maritime borders of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important amendment because the earlier amendment, which I cosponsored with Senator Graham, focused on the appropriation of moneys to go to the southern border, the border between Mexico and the United States. The fact is, those of us who are here working on homeland security should care and do care about making sure we have secure borders to this country, including our land and our maritime borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what this amendment does is it directs that these expenditures of moneys can be spent in securing our land borders to the north and to the south as well as our maritime borders of the United States of America. It is an amendment which is important, and there is an important statement to be made here. Much of the attention we have been giving to the southern border, in terms of the broken borders we are trying to fix in this immigration debate, has taken away the needed amount of attention  we should be focused on with respect to the other borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, we have a very broken system of immigration. We have a very broken system of our borders today in the United States of America. But it is not just the border with Mexico that is broken. It is also the border between the United States and Canada, and it is also our maritime borders that need additional security. So it is my hope that with this amendment we will be able to put attention on our maritime borders as well as our northern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to give a couple of examples about why it is that this amendment is needed. If you look at the number of examples we have with terrorists and other people who would wish to do us harm, they come in from across the borders, many of them come into this country legally and then they overstay their visas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One example of what we know from the north, and that is in December of 1999, the Jordanian police foiled a plot to bomb hotels and other sites frequented by American tourists. It was a U.S. Customs agent on the U.S.-Canadian border who arrested the person who was smuggling explosives intended for an attack on Los Angeles International Airport. So when we talk about homeland security and we talk about securing our border to the south, it is equally important we are securing our border to the north,  and it is equally important we are securing our maritime borders as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example: Recently, a human smuggling ring running undocumented work immigrants into the United States from Canada was dismantled. This was a human smuggling ring that was bringing undocumented workers through Canada. That ring was responsible for bringing dozens of Indian and Pakistani immigrants into the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think these are examples that demonstrate if we are going to secure our borders, it is not just the border between Mexico and the United States that needs to be secured; it is all the borders of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Menendez, Senator Martinez, Senator Graham, and me in the adoption of this amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair>The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 2498 to amendment No. 2383.</chair>

  <narrative>(Purpose: To prohibit funds made available in this Act from being used to implement a rule or regulation related to certain petitions for aliens to perform temporary labor in the United States)</narrative>
  <narrative> On page 69, after line 24, add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sec. 536. Prohibition on Use Funds for Rulemaking Related to Petitions for Aliens.</narrative>
  <narrative> None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security or any delegate of the Secretary to issue any rule or regulation which implements the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to Petitions for Aliens To Perform Temporary Nonagricultural Services or Labor (H-2B) set out beginning on 70 Federal Register 3984 (January 27, 2005).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400357" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me begin by commending Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for their outstanding leadership on this excellent piece of legislation. The fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill will make this country safer, and I thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for their hard work in crafting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I am offering now is, in fact, a very simple amendment. As you know, there is strong concern all over this country about the increase in poverty and the decline of the middle class. It seems to me--at a time when we are hemorrhaging millions of good-paying jobs; at a time when Americans are losing, by the millions, their health insurance, when moms cannot afford affordable childcare, people are losing their pensions--we have to do everything we can to make sure the policies we implement  do not hurt low- and moderate-income families and make a bad situation even worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the contrary, this Congress has to do everything we can to make sure we lift up wages--we lift up working conditions--and not push them down. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor have proposed regulations that, if implemented, could have a significant negative impact in terms of lowering wages and working conditions for American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor have proposed regulations that would eliminate the labor certification process and replace it with a labor attestation process. State workforce agencies and the Department of Labor as a whole would no longer be involved in certifying that employers applying for H-2B visas are not displacing American workers or adversely affecting the wages or working conditions of U.S. workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed regulations, for the most part, would only require employers to attest--to attest--to the Department of Homeland Security that they are following the law. All they have to do is say: I am following the law. Trust us. In other words, the Federal Government would take employers at their word that they are complying with the law, with little, if any, oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, the proposed regulations fail to ensure H-2B visa work is temporary in nature. H-2B work is supposed to be temporary. The proposed regulations fail to ensure that no qualified American worker is available for H-2B positions. In other words, the employer is supposed to go out and make sure there are not American workers available for that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed regulations fail to require that H-2B employers do not adversely affect U.S. wages and working  conditions, all of which are required by current law. In other words, the law says an employer cannot pay low wages which have the impact of lowering wages for all workers in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me very briefly read to my colleagues what the AFL-CIO has written about these regulations:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed regulations would significantly weaken the ability of the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security to meet the statutory requirements of the H-2B program as established by Congress and would establish a new regulatory system that would be arbitrary and capricious. Current administrative procedures have so far failed to adequately protect H-2B workers, domestic workers, and the domestic labor market. The proposed regulations, rather than addressing and remedying  these fundamental flaws in current procedures, would only further undermine the administration's ability to ensure the H-2B program operates in full compliance with the law and in a rational manner. The proposed regulations are not only unacceptable to the AFL-CIO and to worker and immigrant advocates as a matter of public policy--if enacted, they would also constitute an unjustified and unauthorized derogation from the administration's responsibilities under the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, according to a recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center entitled "Close to Slavery," H-2B workers are routinely cheated out of wages; forced to mortgage their futures to obtain low wage, temporary jobs; held virtually captive by employers or labor brokers who seize their documents; forced to live in squalid conditions; and denied medical benefits for on-the-job injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I am offering today would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from using any of the funds in this act to implement these proposed regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the serious abuses of the H-2B program by many employers documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the strong opposition of working people from all over this country, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment. We have a bad situation now. Let us not make it worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, we must make sure that labor protections for American workers and for foreign workers who are temporarily working in our country--we must make sure these regulations are strengthened, not weakened. Over the long term, I will be introducing legislation to accomplish that goal. But in the interim, we must not take a major step backwards in terms of protecting both U.S. workers and guest workers from unscrupulous employers. That is what this amendment is all about, and I urge my colleagues  to vote "yes" on this amendment.</paragraph>

On September 11 at the World Trade Center and the Towers, we know as a matter of fact that lives were lost because the heroic emergency response personnel--the firefighters, the police officers, the emergency medical personnel--simply could not communicate with one another because their systems did not allow them to do that. During Hurricane Katrina, there was a breakdown  because of the catastrophic impact of that natural disaster in the very operability of communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard from experts on how best respond to these disasters and of the crying need for investment in making our communications systems interoperable. Our State and local emergency response officials, elected officials, tell us this is a crying need. The fact is it is a need that is very hard, particularly for local governments, to satisfy. Anybody who has ever dealt with a municipal budget looks at the budget of the firefighters, the police departments--these are personnel-intensive budgets.  There is not enough left over for what might be called capital investments, equipment investments. So this need for interoperable communications, which will save lives, without question, will simply not be met fast enough if we leave it to the local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in the 9/11 Commission bill which we will consider later, this interoperability emergency communications grant program is not only created but authorizes the expenditure of $1.6 billion for this purpose over the next 4 years. This Homeland Security appropriations bill before us makes a substantial increase over the President's budget in funding for homeland security, $2 1/4  billion. It is absolutely the right thing to do. It is absolutely the necessary thing to do to protect the American  people from disaster and/or a terrorist attack. However, the bill before us does not include any money for interoperability of communications at the local level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps because this conference report we are going to consider tonight was not adopted when the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee reached its judgments, I will say for the record that the Senate itself earlier this year, in the Senate budget resolution, supported $400 million in dedicated funding for this program, with passage of that budget resolution, in anticipation, I believe, of this new program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment, offered by the Senator from Maine and myself and the Senator from Missouri, does is to provide $100 million to fund a first payment to fund this new interoperability emergency communications grant program. It is a kind of downpayment at a meaningful level; not as much as is necessary, but a beginning to this program. The authorization in the conference report is important. It takes a critical step forward. But it must be funded, or it will not mean anything to our first responders  and those of the rest of us in America who depend on them for our protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to note as an indication of the urgent need for this kind of funding that the following first responder groups have written and expressed their support for this amendment: the International Association of Firefighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials International, the Congressional Fire Service Institute, and the National Volunteer Fire Council. All of these folks  representing millions of first responders around America are asking for this funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will report to my colleagues that the House has included $50 million as a first payment to fund this interoperability communications fund in its Homeland Security appropriations bill. I hope my colleagues will help us do our part, now that we are about to authorize the fund later tonight by adopting this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want our colleagues to know we are trying to work as diligently as possible to move forward at this time.

So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey to speak for 10 minutes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate my distinguished colleague from Washington State providing the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of the Salazar-Menendez amendment. I expect from all of the voices I have heard in our debate about immigration as part of this Homeland Security bill that we will have resounding support for this amendment, because I know those who want to protect the United States at its border crossings are going to want to protect all of its border crossings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard a lot about our challenges along our southern border, but I have heard nothing about our challenges along our northern border. In that respect, I think it is important to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that over the last several years, according to official reports, the Congressional Research Service tells us there have been nearly 69,000 individuals who have crossed over the northern border and, of course, that number is small in comparison because we don't have the  Border Patrol agents on the northern border to be dealing with the interdictions that would be called for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while there are 13,488 Border Patrol agents in the entire force, there are only 965 agents along the northern border. That northern border has over 5,525 miles of border between the United States and the North, significantly more than the 1,993 miles along the southern border. Yet over 69,000 people have crossed, to our knowledge, because if you divide out the number of Border Patrol agents at any given time on the northern border, they are looking at patrolling hundreds and hundreds of miles  for a fraction of what is the Border Patrol on any given shift. Therefore, what that number tells us is that while thousands cross on the northern border, we don't even know the magnitude of it, because we are not paying attention. We are not paying attention on the northern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remind my colleagues that it was Ahmed Ressam in 1999, December of 1999, the millennium bomber, who came in through the northern border of the United States. We don't seem to be concerned about the northern border. What Senator Salazar's and my amendment simply does is to make sure that we are, in fact, looking at all of our international borders and allocating the resources appropriately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, unless this debate is about something more than protecting the United States, we should have a resounding vote. Because if you are concerned about one terrorist coming through a border, you should be concerned about a border that is far more porous, far greater in length; the one that actually has a history of having someone who sought to commit an act of violence within the United States crossing that northern border--one that is totally undermanned in the context of protecting that border  and, obviously, it means we have far greater numbers than the 69,000;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the same time, one in which we have actually seen the number of Border Patrol agents decrease. We have a mandate in the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act that mandated that the Canadian border receive increases in Border Patrol agents equal to 20 percent of the Border Patrol agents that exist. And, ultimately, we have seen a reduction during fiscal year 2005-2006 in the total number of Border Patrol agents by nearly 9 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have a history of people crossing the border, a history of the millennium bomber. Yet we have a decrease in Border Patrol agents who are on the northern border. You are either for protecting the country or you are not. By the way, if I were a terrorist, and I wanted to get into the United States, and the bottom line is that I know they are going to put everybody down at the southern border, guess what. I would be coming through the northern border because with over 5,500 miles and with  only 965 total Border Patrol agents for three shifts around the clock for that whole stretch, that makes it a much greater percentage for me to be able to come over the northern border than to face the challenges of the southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know our colleagues here who care so much, as we do, about the national security and the defense of this country are going to give this amendment an overwhelming vote. I expect it to be accepted by a voice vote. If the answer is no, we are not concerned about the northern border, then I have to question the motives of some in this debate because we are either concerned about the security of the country or we have a certain prejudice over a certain part of what we consider a threat to the United  States. Porous borders are a collective threat. But when we focus all of our time and attention at one end, let's leave a wide gaping hole on the other part, the one that has over 2 1/2  times more territory to cover and has probably 10 percent of all the Border Patrol agents in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure this will be accepted by voice or we will have an overwhelming vote because the absence of having an overwhelming vote to make sure we protect our country indicates to me that the concern of some is not about protecting our country, the concern of some is that, in fact, they have a concern about who comes to this country--not because they seek to provide an act of terrorism, but because of who they are. So I think this will be a defining moment in which we can collectively work to protect  our country, make sure we have the appropriate resources and allocations of them to the northern border as well as the southern border, make sure that we fill up all of our security gaps and, therefore, strengthen the security of the country. In the absence of that, many of us will have to question what this debate has really been about.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a fairly simple amendment. I plan on offering this on every appropriations bill. What it says to the American people is we know we are going to do certain things to send projects home. What this says is if you do that, then there ought to be a competitive bid on the project rather than a sweetheart deal to wherever it is going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a very simple amendment. It says if we are going to send something home through an earmark, then the process of expending that money ought to be on a competitive bid basis so we get good value for the American taxpayer--no cost-plus, just competitively bid.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the underlying bill, which makes a tremendous amount of progress, in my opinion, with protecting the homeland--increasing funding for port security, transportation, et cetera, and I have said publicly and privately my great thanks, on behalf of the people of Louisiana whom I represent, to the leaders managing this bill--in the underlying bill, there is a provision that some of us have worked very hard on to help expedite the rebuilding of schools in the gulf coast  area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, 2 years this August is the anniversary of Katrina and Rita. Literally hundreds of schools were destroyed. As I said a thousand times on this floor and will continue to say, the Federal Government was simply overwhelmed by the catastrophic nature of this event, the scope of which had never been seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I offer this amendment, and send one to the desk that I am speaking of now to help fix one very small problem with actually one school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill sets up a process--and I am very grateful to the committee, Republicans and Democrats, who supported a new process--and actually FEMA was very helpful in supporting a new process--to help us rebuild the schools faster, better; not at greater expense to the taxpayer but a better way to deal with this catastrophic disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, if this amendment I am offering right now does not pass, there will be one school that is left out of this fix, and that is why I offer it, on behalf of a very small parish in south Louisiana, a school I happened to visit, a school that thought they had one agreement with FEMA but, evidently, there was a great misunderstanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This school has 500 children who go here, and they have had a very difficult time over the last 2 years, so I offer this amendment for them. It is extremely small, when compared to all the amendments my colleagues are offering, but it would help them to get their small school district back up and running. That is the essence of what the amendment does. As I say, it will affect basically one school in New Iberia Parish.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on an amendment Senator Lieberman and I have offered to provide $100 million in badly needed funding for a new emergency communications grant program. This program is about to be authorized in the Homeland Security bill we have recently completed the conference negotiations on, and which I anticipate will be cleared either tonight or tomorrow morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at the needs of our first responders, interoperability of communications equipment is at the top of their list. We saw on 9/11 that firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical personnel lost their lives because of an inability to communicate due to incompatible equipment. We saw it again in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where police could not communicate with firefighters, who could not communicate with emergency medical personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, achieving interoperability is an expensive, lengthy, and difficult process, and it is one our State and local governments need assistance in meeting. The proposal Senator Lieberman and I have put forth is a pretty modest proposal. The Homeland Security conference report authorizes a $400 million program. The budget resolution did as well for this year. What we are asking for is a modest downpayment of $100 million. It is offset by a modest reduction in other accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that this amendment does have the strong support of our first responder community. It has been endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Firefighters, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials International.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that endorsement letters from those organizations be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 26, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR LIEBERMAN AND SENATOR COLLINS: On behalf of the nation's more than 280,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, I am writing to express our support for your amendment to the 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 providing $100 million for grants to improve emergency communications.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Department of Homeland Security's 2006 National Interoperability Baseline Survey found that first responder agencies have made some progress towards achieving interoperability. However, the failure of emergency personnel to communicate with each other along the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina provides a stark example of just how much work remains to ensure that first responders have adequate communications capabilities in emergencies.</narrative>
  <narrative>The new grant program dedicated to improving first responder communications, established in the 9/11 Commission Act, will help states achieve this critical goal. By permitting funds to be used to assist with a variety of activities, including activities to achieve basic operability, this new program will enable states and regions to overcome their own unique communications challenges, and ensure a solid foundation upon which to build an interoperable communications network.</narrative>
  <narrative>The ability of first responders to communicate with each other, as well as with state and federal authorities, is integral to any effective, coordinated emergency response. The Lieberman-Collins amendment will provide a down payment on our commitment to help America's first responders communicate during an emergency.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your leadership on this vital issue and your continued strong support of our nation's fire fighters.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Harold A. Schaitberger,</narrative>

  <narrative>APCO Supports Lieberman-Collins Communications Interoperability Amendment</narrative>
  <narrative>The Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO) International supports Senators Lieberman and Collins's amendment to appropriate $100 million for a new Interoperable Communications Grant Program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Since 2002, our nation has had to overcome the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast, which showed the operational vulnerability of emergency communications systems. The issue was not only interoperability but also operability. Due to the lack of operable emergency communications systems, command and control of the disasters was almost non-existent.</narrative>
  <narrative>Five years after September 11, 2001 APCO International finds that, while there have been significant accomplishments to report on issues affecting public safety communications, there is also a disturbing lack of progress. Multiple nationwide surveys indicate there are significant shortfalls in communications operability and interoperability in many regions and locales with many contributing factors. The lessons learned from 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for emergency communications are  simple. Be prepared. Preparedness, planning and training are the key elements to achieving operability and interoperability during day-to-day activities and disasters.</narrative>
  <narrative>Preparedness involves planning and implementing current and effective technology solutions. Preparedness involves coordination and mutual aid agreements with surrounding jurisdictions, state and federal government agencies. Preparedness involves making sure your personnel and equipment are able to function during any emergency and meet the unexpected challenges that may arise at any time. Preparedness is making sure the daily operations of the emergency communications center are adaptable to  any unexpected situation. Preparation also includes adequate funding for planning and operations.</narrative>
  <narrative>We strongly believe this amendment will provide the funding needed to vastly enhance our Nation's operability and interoperable emergency communications systems and we hope that your Senator can support this amendment.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>

  <narrative>Fairfax, VA, Mar. 2, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN: On behalf of the nearly 13,000 chief fire and emergency officers of the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to express our support for several major provisions included in <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, the Improving America's Security Act of 2007. I appreciate the hard work and dedication your committee has put into this legislation, and I urge the Senate to move expeditiously towards its passage.</narrative>
  <narrative>The IAFC is proud to endorse the information sharing programs outlined in Title I of the bill. These programs, which include guidelines to help integrate the fire service into fusion centers and a fellowship program designed to improve the exchange of intelligence data between government entities, constitute a significant step forward in our nation's homeland security efforts. By ensuring that fire departments and other emergency response providers participate directly in fusion centers, Title  I will open new doors for nontraditional information gathering, enhanced capabilities assessments, and better coordination between the fire service and law enforcement in planning for and responding to major disasters. Simply put, these changes will make our information sharing programs more effective and our country safer.</narrative>
  <narrative>Additionally, the IAFC strongly supports the operable and interoperable communications programs defined in Title III. The IAFC is working with partners in public safety on numerous fronts to strengthen the voice and data communications capabilities of first responders throughout the United States. Accomplishing this goal requires adequate spectrum for responders to communicate, as well as funding for purchase and installation of the equipment necessary to utilize the available spectrum. At present,  substantial action remains to be taken by the federal government on both fronts, and Title III of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill> will make a positive contribution by authorizing over $3 billion for the Emergency Communications Operable and Interoperable Grants program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Furthermore, the IAFC supports the critical infrastructure provisions set forth in Title X of the Improving America's Security Act. The IAFC looks forward to working towards Title X's critical infrastructure goals through the partnership model currently reflected in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). In particular, we believe that ensuring adequate protection for human elements--as well as physical and cyber elements--will be an essential part of the critical infrastructure protection  efforts carried out by the fire service under this title.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, the IAFC strongly believes that however grant reform measures (such as those described in Title II) are resolved in this legislation, the final product should preserve the all-hazards nature of the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs. These programs were created with an emphasis on equipping the fire service with the tools, equipment, training, staff, and other resources needed to respond effectively to all types of emergencies--whether natural or man-made, great or small. In its present  form, section 2002(c) of the Improving America's Security Act fully protects the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs, and any changes to the grant reform section should preserve section 2002(c) as it is currently written.</narrative>
  <narrative>As the primary fire service leadership organization in the United States, the IAFC would like to thank you and your dedicated staff for your work thus far on <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>. The IAFC stands ready to provide you with information and support as the Improving America's Security Act of 2007 moves forward in the legislative process.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Chief James B. Harmes,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>June 7, 2007. </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN AND RANKING MEMBER COLLINS: On behalf of our organizations, we urge you to consider the following issues as conference negotiations on <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act, and <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, the Improving America's Security Act get underway. Individually and collectively, we appreciate the support you have shown for the fire and emergency services through your work on this critical homeland security legislation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Over the past sereral years, the question of how homeland security grant funding should be distributed has been an extremely contentious issue. While we do not have a position on how this matter should be resolved, we do ask that you make sure that the FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs are not affected by reforms included in the conference report. The FIRE and SAFER Act grant programs were created with an emphasis on equipping the fire service with the tools, equipment, training, staffing, and  other resources needed to respond effectively to all types of emergencies--whether natural or man-made,  great or small. Section 2002 of each bill fully protects these programs, and any compromise grant reform section should preserve these safeguards.</narrative>
  <narrative>A second issue of critical importance to the fire service is the ability to communicate effectively. As you know, first life responders throughout the United States are currently facing major challenges in the area of wireless communications. Fortunately, both <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill> create new grant programs designed to help address this problem. In crafting the final version of the communications grant program, we ask you to retain the $3.3 billion authorization total included in <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, ensure that  funding is available for both operable and interoperable communications projects, and build in flexibility allowing funding to be used for systems in a wide range of operating frequencies. Furthermore, we urge you to ensure that these grants utilize the Department of Homeland Security's SAFECOM grant guidance and fund all of the areas defined in the SAFECOM "Interoperability Continuum," including governance.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition to seeking progress on the issues above, the first responder community also wishes to see a well-prepared private sector that will voluntarily take its share of responsibility for emergency preparedness and business continuity. The voluntary private sector preparedness program outlined in <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, which relies on standards such as the NFPA 1600 Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs, would enable our nation to better protect lives and property. This  initiative complements other first responder disaster and emergency preparedness plans and is critical for a robust homeland security policy. Accordingly, we believe that the Senate-passed language should be retained in the conference report.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, we strongly urge you not to include provisions in the conference report that would establish new federal mandates for re-routing of hazardous materials around urban areas. While we understand that local re-routing may be necessary on a case-by-case basis, federal mandatory re-routing regulations would create additional dangers by shifting hazardous materials to rural areas that may not be as well-staffed or equipped to deal with an incident. In addition, re-routing hazardous materials  would keep them in transit for a longer amount of time, which would increase the risk and the potential for an incident to occur. Larger, urban fire departments are generally in a better position to handle these incidents, because they have more specialized equipment and other resources.</narrative>
  <narrative>Again, thank you for your attention to these pressing homeland security issues. Should you have questions or desire additional information as you move through the conference process, please do not hesitate to contact Kevin King.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Chief James B. Harmes,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;CFO, President, IAFC. &lt;/em&gt;</narrative>

  <narrative>Washington, DC, February 13, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN AND RANKING MEMBER COLLINS: On behalf of the nation's more than 280,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, I applaud you for your efforts to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We are especially grateful that you included in your proposal provisions to reform our nation's Homeland Security Grant Program and enhance first responder communications.</narrative>
  <narrative>The establishment of the new grant program dedicated to improving communications operability and interoperability is vital to protecting the health and safety of our nation's fire fighters. Permitting funds to be used to assist with a variety of activities, including activities to achieve basic operability, will enable states and regions to overcome their own unique communications challenges.</narrative>
  <narrative>Provisions ensuring that states provide local governments and first responders homeland security funding in an expedited manner, and permitting a portion of funds to be used for the payment of overtime and backfill costs will allow communities to take full advantage of this invaluable federal assistance.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Improving America's Security Act also demonstrates your strong commitment to America's fire service. By guaranteeing that members of the fire service are involved in local planning to determine effective funding priorities, and by maintaining FIRE and SAFER grants as separate and distinct programs, you properly ensure that America's fire service will continue to receive funding to fulfill its vital role in local emergency preparedness.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your leadership on these vital issues. We appreciate your willingness to work closely with the IAFF in developing the Improving America's Security Act, and look forward to continuing our work together on behalf of our nation's emergency response personnel.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, again, I hope our colleagues will take a hard look at this amendment and will decide it warrants their support to address one of the major problems that has hampered emergency response, decreased the effectiveness of those who are putting their lives on the line, and truly can be a matter of life and death.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I first thank Senator Murray, Senator Cochran, and our colleagues for their support. This is an important amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. The Homeland Security appropriations bill could not have funded the Emergency Grant Program set up by the 9/11 bill, which we have not passed yet, so I appreciate very much their support. This amendment is supported by almost all of the first responder groups--firefighters, police officers, volunteer  firefighters, et cetera--because they desperately need funding to help them make their communication systems interoperable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, what the H-2B program provides is that guest workers may come into this country on a temporary basis if no qualified U.S. worker is available for that position and that the wages paid to H-2B employees do not adversely impact U.S. wages and working conditions. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor have proposed regulations that would eliminate the labor certification process and move toward a process which has virtually no enforcement  mechanisms and which simply takes the employer's word as to  whether they are obeying these regulations. In other words: Trust us, we are doing the right thing.</paragraph>

SENSE OF SENATE ON IMMIGRATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) On June 28th, 2007, the Senate, by a vote of 46 to 53, rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Illegal immigration remains the top domestic issue in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The people of the United States continue to feel the effects of a failed immigration system on a daily basis, and they have not forgotten that Congress and the President have a duty to address the issue of illegal immigration and the security of the international borders of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) People from across the United States have shared with members of the Senate their wide ranging and passionate opinions on how best to reform the immigration system.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) There is no consensus on an approach to comprehensive immigration reform that does not first secure the international borders of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) There is unanimity that the Federal Government has a responsibility to, and immediately should, secure the international borders of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Border security is an integral part of national security.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The greatest obstacle the Federal Government faces with respect to the people of the United States is a lack of trust that the Federal Government will secure the international borders of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) This lack of trust is rooted in the past failures of the Federal Government to uphold and enforce immigration laws and the failure of the Federal Government to secure the international borders of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Failure to uphold and enforce immigration laws has eroded respect for those laws and eliminated the faith of the people of the United States in the ability of their elected officials to responsibly administer immigration programs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) It is necessary to regain the trust of the people of the United States in the competency of the Federal Government to enforce immigration laws and manage the immigration system.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Securing the borders of the United States would serve as a starting point to begin to address other issues surrounding immigration reform on which there is not consensus.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) Congress has not fully funded some interior and border security activities that it has authorized.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) The President of the United States can initiate emergency spending by designating certain spending as "emergency spending" in a request to the Congress.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) The lack of security on the international borders of the United States rises to the level of an emergency.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (16) The Border Patrol are apprehending some, but not all, individuals from countries that the Secretary of State has determined have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism who cross or attempt to cross illegally into the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (17) The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a human smuggling ring that has been bringing Iraqis and other Middle Eastern individuals across the international borders of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the Federal Government should work to regain the trust of the people of the United States in its ability of the Federal Government to secure the international borders of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) in order to restore the credibility of the Federal Government on this critical issue, the Federal Government should prove its ability to enforce immigration laws by taking actions such as securing the border, stopping the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States, and creating a tamper-proof biometric identification card for foreign workers; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the President should request emergency spending that fully funds--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) existing interior and border security authorizations that have not been funded by Congress; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the border and interior security initiatives contained in the bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform and for other purposes (<bill type="s" number="1639">S. 1639</bill>) introduced in the Senate on June 18, 2007.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;AMENDMENT NO. 2500, AS MODIFIED&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    <paragraph>Mr. President, on May 4, Greensburg, KS, was devastated by a tornado. Our thoughts and prayers are very much with the many families affected by this disaster, and we fully support their rebuilding efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Roberts and Senator Brownback to the Homeland Security appropriations bill that would allow Greensburg to hire the essential workers it needs to help rebuild the town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The protections in current law governing national emergency grants under the Workforce Investment Act serve an important purpose. They ensure that the program is targeted to help workers who need it most, and is not used to displace public sector workers with workers that do not receive the same wage and merit system protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greensburg, however, faces unique circumstances. In the wake of the disaster, this small city has an obvious need for professionals--such as zoning experts, planning professionals, and building inspectors--with expertise that is not readily available in the area. In these unique circumstances, the waivers provided for in this bill are a reasonable response. It is obviously not, however, a precedent for future recipients of these emergency grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope very much that these waivers will do as much as possible to help the people of Greensburg restore their city and rebuild their lives, and I wish them well in the years ahead.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, my amendment is an amendment I wish I did not have to offer. It is necessary, unfortunately, because of the administration's continued plan to outsource or privatize critical components of our homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have Senators Kennedy, Schumer, Lautenberg, Akaka, Menendez, Kerry, Mikulski, Cardin and the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee respectively, Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, as cosponsors of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also has the endorsement of the American Federation of Government Employees. I will ask to have printed in the Record their letter of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the most recent key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate were crystal clear: our homeland is under a "heightened threat environment" and that al-Qaida is undiminished in its goal in attacking us here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the very same time, despite a lot of tough rhetoric, the Bush administration wants to cut the only Federal agency responsible for protecting nearly 9,000 nonmilitary Federal buildings nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Protective Service, or FPS, protects more than 1.1 million Federal employees located in more than 2,100 communities across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While protecting Federal buildings, the FPS also monitors the qualifications and performance of 15,000 privately contracted security guards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1995, after the Oklahoma City bombing, the General Services Administration and Congress concluded that FPS required 1,480 field personnel to do its duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 9/11, as we face even greater threat, as we have rightfully heightened our security and vigilance here at home, the Bush administration has slashed FPS personnel to fewer than 1,200. If it has its way, the administration will cut that number to 950 in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just today, we learned that the FPS has recently issued an internal document, entitled "Increased Risk of Terrorist Attack This Summer" detailing high-risk threats to Federal buildings and employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, Richard L. Skinner, investigated the FPS. Among the disturbing findings: Only a dozen FPS employees are tasked with checking the credentials and performances of the 5,700 guards in the DC area--"an inadequate number" according to the audit; 30 percent of contract security guards in the sample had at least one expired certification, security contractors failing to perform security services according to terms and conditions of their  contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report concluded that many of the deficiencies cited occurred because FPS personnel were not effectively monitoring the contract guard program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 1, 2007, Jim Taylor, the deputy inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security and stated that further reductions in the FPS "could lead to uneven effects across the nation, perhaps place some facilities at risk."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, contract security guards did not show up for work at the Department of Education and two Food and Drug Administration offices. The contract guards' employer had not paid 400 employees in a month, citing financial difficulties. But FPS did pay the company for its services. It turns out that the company's president served 5 years in jail for bank fraud and money laundering. According to company's general manager, the president of the company used company money to pay for luxury condos  here in the District of Columbia and in Myrtle Beach, SC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This latest episode only underscores the importance of not cutting the Federal Protective Services staff, but increasing it. It not only saves us from wasting Federal resources--it could save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would stop the Department of Homeland Security from continuing to downsize the Federal  Protective Service. The amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to assure that the workforce of the Federal Protective Service includes no fewer than 1,200 commanders, police officers, and special agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting Federal buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does not require an offset or any additional spending. FPS operations are solely funded through security fees and reimbursements paid for by Federal agencies. The amendment would require the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security to adjust Federal building security fees as necessary to ensure full funding of not fewer than 1,200 in-service commanders, police officers, inspectors, and special agents at the Federal Protective Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, security on the cheap is no security at all. Our Nation faces serious threats--this Congress should demand a response by the Bush administration commensurate with the danger--and the President's own rhetoric. I ask my colleagues to join me to ensure that the Federal Protective Services has the personnel needed to do its job and that we do not send the message that our Federal buildings are exposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week's key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate made clear that al-Qaida has "protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability" and is now as strong as it was in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the work of Senator Byrd and the members of the Appropriations Committee for putting together a Homeland Security appropriations bill that supports tough and smart measures to make our country more secure. This is a must-pass piece of legislation that we cannot afford to delay and I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to obstruct this critical legislation so we can implement these measures to make our country more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to which I referred.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 24, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR: On behalf of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, I urge you to support Senator Clinton's amendment to the FY '08 Homeland Security Appropriations bill to insure that our nation's federal buildings are adequately protected. For the past several months the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been implementing a proposal to eliminate over 350 commanders, police officers, and special agents from the Federal Protective  Service (FPS). Experienced law enforcement officers have been actively encouraged to leave the agency. leaving vulnerable countless federal buildings that once receive around-the-clock FPS protection.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Bush Administration is attempting to unilaterally alter the mission of this critical homeland security agency despite the demonstrated need for high security at federal buiidings and complexes. It would be hard to forget that day in April 1995, when domestic terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols drove up to the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City and unleashed the first major terrorist attack in the U.S. In the post-9/11 world in which we live, to eliminate the law enforcement  and antiterrorism activities of the Federal Protective Service is unthinkable.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Senate Appropriations Committee included strong language opposing the FPS plan and the House calls it an unfunded mandate and requires the agency to negotiate security agreements with every impacted state and local law enforcement agency, yet the Department continues to press forward with its misguided, dangerous initiative.</narrative>
  <narrative>For this reason it has become necessary to require the Department to maintain a specified level of manpower in order to insure our continuing safety. In order to assure that the FPS is restored to its full complement of personnel, Senator CLINTON will offer an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that requires the Department to maintain a minimum of 1200 total in-service personnel (Commanders, Inspectors, Police Officers and Special Agents). This is based on a field staffing  level for FPS of 1480 which was GSA's target until 2003.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Federal Protective Service is an often overlooked, yet critical component of our overall homeland security safety net. The GAO has been asked by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to conduct a review of FPS funding and other issues. We strongly believe that in view of that pending study, fundamental reform of the FPS mission, such as the Administration is proposing, is inappropriate and should be stopped.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

  <narrative>Mr. President, I would have called up amendment No. 2487.</narrative>
  <narrative>This amendment is also cosponsored by Senator DORGAN.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. President, in a little over a week, the Transportation Security Administration plans to lift its ban on disposable butane lighters, a decision that is both ill-advised and ill-considered. Lifting the ban on these lighters defies common sense and ignores the TSA's own recommendations.</narrative>
  <narrative>In March 2005, a TSA spokesman said, "The threat posed by lighters on board is valid." TSA has warned that al-Qaida and those seeking to do us harm intend to use everyday household items to conceal explosives and detonate them on board airliners.</narrative>
  <narrative>In fact, the TSA actually wanted to go further than banning lighters alone. The TSA wanted to ban matches, too. But the Bush administration demanded that the TSA conduct cost-benefit analysis before banning matches, another decision that calls into question the commitment within the administration to matching security rhetoric with smart security policies. Even the CEO of the Zippo Company, a company that manufactures disposable butane lighters, expressed support for the lighter ban stating,</narrative>
  <narrative>And we all remember, in December 2001, when Richard Reid, the so-called "Shoe Bomber," attempted to murder 197 people onboard an American Airlines flight when he attempted to set off explosives hidden in his shoe using a box of matches. According to the FBI, Reid likely would have been successful if he had used a butane lighter.</narrative>
  <narrative>The TSA claims that lifting the ban will free up time for security officers to focus on finding more high threat items. However, the TSA is not lifting the ban on all lighters. Passengers will still not be allowed to carry torch lighters or cigar lighters onboard an aircraft.</narrative>
  <narrative>The result? Instead of banning all lighters, security officers will now have to differentiate between disposable butane lighters and other lighters in every single piece of luggage that they have to inspect. Even on the TSA's own website the difference between what is acceptable and what is not is hard to discern.</narrative>
  <narrative>And this justification has been tested before, when the TSA lifted the ban on small scissors and knives. In April, the Government Accountability Office released a report on that decision. The GAO found that it is unclear whether lifting that ban "had any impact on Transportation Security Officers' ability to detect explosives--a key goal for the change."</narrative>
  <narrative>The decision to lift the ban on disposable butane lighters makes inspecting luggage more difficult, makes the rules more complicated, and makes the skies more dangerous.</narrative>
  <narrative>So, let's briefly summarize the TSA's decision. You can bring a disposable butane lighter but not a cigar lighter or a torch lighter. You can bring a fueled lighter onboard but you cannot check it in your luggage. You can bring explosive liquid in the form of a fueled butane lighter but cannot bring a large tube of toothpaste in the form of toothpaste.</narrative>
  <narrative>And you don't need the lighter anyway because you cannot smoke onboard. It seems that common sense has left the gate at the Transportation Security Administration.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. President, my amendment would have continued to prohibit butane lighters onboard an aircraft until the TSA provides Congress a report identifying all anticipated security benefits and any possible vulnerabilities associated with allowing butane lighters into airport sterile areas and onboard an aircraft, as well as any supporting analysis justifying their conclusions.</narrative>
  <narrative>Further, my amendment would have required the GAO to conduct an assessment of the report submitted by TSA to Congress. Until these reports were conducted, the ban on butane lighters would remain in place.</narrative>
  <narrative>My amendment has the support of the 55,000-member Association of  Flight Attendants. I will ask that a letter from the Association of Flight Attendants be printed in the RECORD.</narrative>
  <narrative>Flight attendants are on the front lines in the event of a terrorist attack involving aircraft. They are our first responders onboard and understand what could constitute a dangerous tool in the hands of a determined terrorist. After September 11, 2001, keeping weapons--and any device that could be used as a weapon--off passenger airplanes is not "security theatre." It is security, plain and simple.</narrative>
  <narrative>My amendment also has the endorsement of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents over 25,000 Federal law enforcement officers, including Federal Air Marshals. I will ask that their letter of support be printed in the RECORD.</narrative>
  <narrative>In their letter, they say that "allowing butane lighters onto commercial aircraft would jeopardize the safety of both the flying public and the Federal Air Marshals who protect them."</narrative>
  <narrative>I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this amendment. Let's restore common sense and do all we can to limit the kinds of potential weapons terrorists may employ onboard aircraft.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred by printed in the RECORD.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>ATTENDANTS--CWA, AFL-CIO,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 25, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR CLINTON: On behalf of the 55,000 members from 20 Airlines represented by the Association of Flight Attendants--CWA, I am writing to express our support for your efforts to reinstitute the ban on lighters onboard passenger aircraft. We look forward to working with you to reinstitute this common sense security measure.</narrative>
  <narrative>As the first responders onboard passenger aircraft, we were extremely frustrated with the decision by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in December of 2005 to lift the ban on scissors, screwdrivers and other tools that could be used as potential weapons onboard the aircraft. Such a move by the TSA was shortsighted and not in the best interest of the overall security of passenger aircraft and our aviation system. Furthermore, they failed to take into consideration the concerns of  flight attendants, those that are jeopardized the most by reintroducing these dangerous items into our workplace.</narrative>
  <narrative>This recent TSA decision to lift the ban on lighters is no different. It is yet another shortsighted move on their part to supposedly free up screener time to check for other, more dangerous, items. If the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, had a lighter during his efforts to bring down an American Airlines flight he most likely would have succeeded. The ban on lighters was a common sense move to prevent another tragedy and must be reinstated.</narrative>
  <narrative>Flight attendants are in a unique position, as the first responders onboard all passenger aircraft, to know what could constitute a dangerous tool in the hands of a determined terrorist. We remain adamant that TSA must reinstitute its ban on small blades and tools and this recent decision to allow lighters onboard the aircraft should be reinstated.</narrative>
  <narrative>Again, we look forward to working with you to reinstate this common sense safety procedure.</narrative>
  <narrative>Respectfully,</narrative>
  <narrative>Patricia A. Friend,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>OFFICERS ASSOCIATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Lewisberry, PA, July 26, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR CLINTON: As the President of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), representing over 25,000 Federal law enforcement officers, I wish to offer our support for continuing the ban on butane lighters on commercial aircraft.</narrative>
  <narrative>A decision to change the "Prohibited Item List" and allow butane lighters on commercial aircraft could have potentially life threatening consequences. If in the well known "shoe bomber case" Richard Reid had used a butane lighter the results might have been catastrophic.</narrative>
  <narrative>Both the flying public and TSA screeners have become accustomed to the ban on butane lighters and a change now would only create confusion among them. Furthermore, allowing butane lighters onto commercial aircraft would jeopardize the safety of both the flying public and the Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) who protect them.</narrative>
  <narrative>We fully support your efforts to keep butane lighters on the "Prohibited Item List" however we continue to have concerns about certain items that have been removed in the past. The safety of Federal law enforcement officers who fly armed to prevent terrorist attacks should never be compromised. The safety of the flight crew and the flying public is of paramount importance to all of us.</narrative>
  <narrative>If I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me at 917-738-2300.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="FUNDING FOR MASS TRANSIT AND COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEMS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, concerning the amendment I have filed to the pending bill on the floor regarding the use of Transit Security Grant Program funding for mass transit and commuter rail systems across the Nation. My fellow home State Senator, Mr. Specter, is a cosponsor of this amendment. As the chairman is aware, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit  Authority, SEPTA, is the fifth largest public transportation system in the Nation. SEPTA's mulimodal transit system provides a network of fixed-route service, including bus, subway, subway-surface, regional rail, light rail, trackless trolley and paratransit service. The SEPTA service area includes the heavily populated southeastern Pennsylvania counties</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current SEPTA communications system does not permit communication inside the system's 20-mile commuter tunnel network and underground concourses. This puts significant limits on SEPTA's ability to deal with emergencies that occur in its underground facilities. To address this matter, SEPTA is working to develop a system that will allow the Authority to effectively participate in all emergency response and recovery actions which may occur in the system's tunnel network. This project will enable  SEPTA to take measures to enhance safety and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based upon my conversations with SEPTA officials, I understand that it has been unable to fully utilize Federal homeland security funds in past years for this initiative. SEPTA officials report that Federal restrictions require expenditure of homeland security funds within a 3-year time period. SEPTA officials further report that implementing a system-wide underground communications network, including appropriate use of capital investment planning and effective procurement practices, is not possible  within this existing time frame. SEPTA has therefore been unable to make the progress it desired on this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the potential consequences of current restrictions, it was my hope that an amendment expanding the timeframe for expenditure of fiscal year 2008 Transit Security Grant Program funds from the existing 36 months to 48 months be adopted to enable transit systems across the nation, including SEPTA, to use their available funds in a more flexible manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, as well as the chairman of the authorizing committee, the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, has several concerns regarding this amendment. I fully appreciate the valid points they raise and look forward to working with them to come to an appropriate solution. I would note that the distinguished Member from West Virginia has been very supportive of assistance in providing appropriate Federal funding for important  homeland security initiatives in my home State and I wish to convey my gratitude.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="FUNDING FOR MASS TRANSIT AND COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEMS">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished Member from Pennsylvania for his remarks on the amendment he has filed. The safety and security of our Nation's mass transit systems is a critical priority for me. We only need be reminded of the terror attacks in Madrid on a commuter rail system in 2004 and in London on the underground system in 2005 to appreciate the magnitude and urgency of the threat to our transit and rail networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleague to help ensure that SEPTA, and all mass transit and commuter rail systems, have the necessary resources to ensure their safety and security, including facilitation of communications  between first responders in the event of an attack. To the extent that the SEPTA system faces a unique challenge with regard to flexibility and duration of use of their existing Federal funds, I look forward to working with you  and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to find an appropriate solution that meets the legitimate safety needs of the passengers and employees of the system.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="THE NORTHERN BORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act required that DHS triple the number for border patrol agents at the northern border, the Trade Act of 2002 required 285 additional customs inspectors for the northern border and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included a provision that authorized an increase of 2,000 U.S. border protection agents each year from FY2006 through FY2010 and further required that 20 percent of the increase in agent manpower each fiscal year be  assigned to the northern border. However, nearly a third of those agents have not been deployed to the northern border. According to the Congressional Research Service, the gap between the authorized level of Customs and Border Protection officers at the northern border and the actual number of officers deployed there will be roughly 1,517 in FY2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the Senate just passed the Graham-Pryor amendment that will provide $3 billion for border security and 23,000 full time agents to our borders. I ask my friend from West Virginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is it the intent of the amendment to provide those assets to both the northern and southern borders, and, to further implement the authorizations I mentioned, to deploy more agents to the northern border?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="THE NORTHERN BORDER">
    <paragraph>I appreciate my friend from Michigan's concern about the northern border and tell him that yes, the amendment is meant to increase staffing at both of our borders and it is not the intent of the amendment to favor one border over the other. The Appropriations Committee has been clear in its support for the Border Patrol and its mission of preventing entry into the Untied States of illegal aliens, terrorists, weapons of mass destruction and other illicit goods or individuals. Further,  in recognition of the importance of security at our northern border, the Appropriations Committee has directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to assign to the Northern Border 20 percent of the net increase in agents in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="THE NORTHERN BORDER">
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Byrd for this important clarification. I thank Senator Levin for being such a leader on this issue. I think it is important that people understand that this is not an issue that the northern states just decided to raise in the interest of getting our fair share. It is a matter of national security. The 9/11 Commission's report cites a lack of balance in manpower between the northern and southern borders. They note that the would-be terrorists in the  millennium plot were detained on the northern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not about being parochial. This is about our national security. This is about making sure that we have the resources to stop a terrorist from bringing materials for a dirty bomb in from Canada. It's about stopping the flow of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs like meth and marijuana that come in from the north each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank Chairman Byrd for clarifying that the additional Border Patrol personnel and funding contained in the Graham-Pryor amendment is not just going to go to the southern border, but will go to both of our borders. This amendment is vital to our homeland security, and I think that if the northern border gets 20 percent of the resources outlined in the amendment, we will have really done something significant to enhance the security of our 4,300 mile border with Canada. And so I  thank the authors of the amendment, one of whom is here with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Graham, can you clarify that the intent of your amendment was to make additional Border Patrol agents and funding available for both the northern and southern border?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="THE NORTHERN BORDER">
    <paragraph>My friend from Montana is correct. The intent of the amendment was to improve our security and increase assets at both the northern and southern borders.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition to explain my vote against the DeMint amendment no. 2481 to the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted against the DeMint amendment because it prohibited the Secretary from modifying the existing list of crimes disqualifying someone from receiving a Transportation Worker Identification Credential when circumstances warrant a regulatory change. Sound public policy requires flexibility on such matters and Congress can rely on the Secretary, a Cabinet official, to exercise sound discretion. If the Secretary fails to do so, Congress can always intervene and change the law.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I voted in favor of tabling the Alexander-Collins amendment on the REAL ID Act, Senate Amendment 2405, because I wanted to prevent reducing by almost 1 percent critical Federal spending on port and rail security, first responders' resources, and other homeland security protections. Rail infrastructure is the most widely attacked terrorist target in the world, and we must increase, not decrease, funding for our railroads. Similarly, port security is a top priority  in our antiterrorism campaign, and I opposed this effort to divert funding from protecting our ports. I appreciate the work of my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to craft a balanced spending bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the fiscal year 2008 Department of Homeland Security, DHS, appropriations bill. The underlying legislation provides $37.5 billion--$2.3 billion more than the President requested--to help DHS defend against what the recently declassified National Intelligence Estimate, NIE, concluded will be "a persistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three years."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, however, has threatened to veto this bill and hold up essential security funding because its funding level is slightly above his budget request. After years of underfunding homeland security, cutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, and failing to veto one pork-laden spending bill passed by the GOP Congress, it is hard to take the President's sudden conversion to fiscal responsibility seriously. He has long since proven his appetite for spending beyond  our means and has lost the support of his fiscally conservative base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In crafting this and other spending bills, the Democratically-controlled Congress is meeting our needs while adhering to pay-as-you-go rules which will help stem the record deficits of the last 6 years. This critical legislation funds important programs to protect the border, improve aviation security, fund and train first responders, and provide disaster relief to the States, and it does it without busting the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that the bill provides $1 billion above the President's budget request for State and local grant programs such as the Urban Area Security Initiative and Port Security Grant Program. This will ensure that Massachusetts and other strategically important States receive an increase in counterterrorism funding in 2008. I remained concerned, however, that DHS still does not award grants solely according to risk. Given the sobering conclusions of the NIE, we cannot afford to  misallocate homeland security grants. I thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for accepting an amendment that I offered which requires the Government Accountability Office to review the methodology the department uses to rank States and cities according to risk. Congress needs to know this information so that it can make informed decisions regarding the Department's grant policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for accepting my amendment to create a pilot program to test automated document authentication technology at ports of entry. The technology DHS uses to authenticate foreign travel documents is unfortunately no better now than on 9/11. It simply checks personal information against databases which we know are not always accurate. In keeping with the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, this pilot program will hopefully  compel DHS to deploy technology that can detect security features and distinguish between real and fraudulent travel documents. DHS is spending millions to implement the US-VISIT  and Western Hemisphere Initiative but has</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate also adopted a bipartisan amendment to add $3 billion in emergency spending to help DHS hire more Border Patrol agents, detention beds, and monitoring equipment along the border which we all agree it needs. This amendment, while important, is not a substitute for finishing work on comprehensive immigration reform legislation, and I hope that Congress will revisit this important issue. Keeping 12 million undocumented workers in the shadows is neither good for our economy or our security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, <bill type="h" number="2368">H.R. 2368</bill> provides for the first time adequate funding for agencies and programs within DHS. It would be irresponsible and reckless for the President to veto this bill, and I hope he reconsiders his position.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will support final passage of the Homeland Security appropriations bill today because its funding is vital to our first responders and all of those responsible for protecting us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although all Americans are united in our commitment to secure our homeland, the administration's budget has too often not reflected that commitment. In particular, we have not kept faith with our first responders by giving them the tools they need, and we have not done enough to secure our borders. I am glad that this bill will make much needed improvements on these and other issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill appropriates $37.6 billion for homeland security programs for fiscal year 2008, which is an increase of $2.2 billion over the President's budget. Perhaps most significantly, the legislation provides vital funding to our first responders to protect our country from a terrorist attack and ensure that we are able to respond adequately should such an attack occur. Specifically, it provides $525 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, $820 million for the Urban Area Security  Initiative, $700 million for the assistance to firefighters grants and $300 million for emergency management performance grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To secure our borders, a total of $10.2 billion is provided for Customs and Border Protection. I am pleased that, in addition to the funding in the underlying bill, the Senate also adopted an amendment to add an additional $3 billion for border security which will enable the Department of Homeland Security to hire, train and deploy 23,000 additional full-time boarder patrol agents and provide other essential security measures at our borders. The legislation also provides $4.432 billion for immigration  and customs enforcement, including $146 million for 4,000 new detention beds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to note that the bill increases funding for the Transportation Security Administration by $164.6 million above last year's level, which is $764 million more than requested by the President. It provides $529.4 million for the procurement and installation of explosive detection systems at airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding levels in this bill reflect our commitment to protecting the American people, and I am hopeful they will be maintained in conference and that we can quickly get this legislation to the President for his signature.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Homeland Security appropriations bill now on the floor. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I am proud of the bill we crafted. This bill will provide our country with more of the resources it needs to protect our communities and secure our residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homeland security is particularly important to my home State. New Jersey lost 700 people on 9/11 families torn apart and lives ended without ever seeing loved ones again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And New Jersey is ripe with targets for terrorists, from our ports to our chemical plants. In fact, the FBI has stated that the most dangerous 2 miles in America for terrorism lie within the stretch of land from Port Newark to Newark Liberty International Airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The level of funding for the Department of Homeland Security directly affects the safety of residents in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I'm glad that this legislation would invest $37.6 billion into making our homeland safer and more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This figure is $2.2 billion more than what President Bush asked for. And because of that, the President is threatening to veto the bill. This is astonishing and it is wrong--$2.2 billion is less money than we spend in 1 week in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate must stand up, pass this legislation, and begin to turn a corner to provide more money to effectively defend our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to more money for border security, this bill provides critical funding for first responders, including $560 million for firefighter equipment grants, $525 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program--which is $275 million above the President's request--and $375 million for law enforcement and terrorism prevention grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also doubles port and rail security grants in the Bush proposal to $400 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Port of New Jersey and New York is largest port on the east coast--and the second-busiest container port in the country. Our ports in south Jersey are part of the Delaware River port system, which is the busiest crude oil tanker port in the country. Through these ports, many goods and materials transit to store shelves, gas pumps and factory assembly lines in the towns and cities in the interior of our country. In short, our ports are essential to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in 2006, Amtrak had record ridership of 25 million. Ridership is already up in 2007 by 5 percent. On an average weekday, nearly a million New Jerseyans rely on our transit systems to get to work, including trains, buses, and light rail lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funding for port and rail security is vital for our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the President--with great fanfare--signed a port security which authorized $400 million for port security grants this year. But then he failed to fund it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate is prepared to follow through on the promise of this vital funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also proud that we are working to protect our homeland--and our economy--from terrorists who set their sights on hazardous cargoes at sea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators INOUYE, STEVENS and I introduced legislation earlier this year to better protect maritime vessels carrying hazardous chemicals and petrochemicals. I am pleased that the committee has agreed with my request to include funding for maritime hazardous cargo protection--including liquefied natural gas--in this Homeland Security bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am further pleased that the committee acknowledged in the Report for this bill the need to expand the laboratory space at the Transportation Security Lab, TSL, in Pomona, NJ, in order to accommodate the Department's explosives detection equipment certification program. This program certifies all explosives detection equipment used by the Transportation Security Administration, and provides certifications to equipment vendors. It is clear that this facility must be expanded to safely accommodate  this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am glad the Senate is once again going on record to support my provision to protect the rights of states to pass chemical security laws that are stronger than Federal regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS recently put rules into effect for the Federal regulation of chemical plant security. But in doing so, the agency wants to preempt states from enacting stronger chemical security laws. This is the wrong approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in the Homeland Security funding bill before us wisely preserves the right of states to adopt chemical security measures stronger than Federal regulations. This language is supported by the chairs of the 9/11 Commission, the National Governors Association, and the National Conference of State Legislatures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put: preempting State laws would make the people of my State and other States less safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in this bill will allow States to go beyond the Federal regulations as long as there is no actual conflict with the federal regulations. This  means that unless it is impossible to comply with both State law and Federal law, the State law is not preempted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between the increases in funding for first responders, port, rail and maritime security, and the protection of States rights to pass chemical security laws that are stronger than Federal regulations, this is the right bill at the right time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and I urge the President to sign it into law.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today marks an important milestone for this Congress. It seems that after spending the first half of the year staging political show-votes and investigations, our friends on the other side have woken up to the fact they only had two things to show for it: an angrier base and a long to-do list. In the fog of battle they forgot that getting things done in the Senate takes cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have cooperated on this bill. And it is a lot better for it. I am extremely pleased the majority ultimately accepted Senator Graham's border security amendment. We got the message last month: border security first. And now, thanks to this effort, we will be delivering a $3 billion downpayment on a stronger border. I also appreciate Senator Cornyn's insistence that interior enforcement be a part of that funding. To us it's pretty simple: there is no homeland security without  border security. We will continue to push this idea on the floor of the Senate in the coming weeks and months. Today is just the beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lesson we can learn from the last 6 months is that there is a cost to everything. And the cost of putting off legislating in favor of around-the-clock politics is that there isn't much to show for it in the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been my view all along that we should have been working on appropriations bills all summer. Here we are almost in August and we have only passed one. So we are looking at a potential train wreck in September. But it is possible that if we work together, like we did this time, we can still make good progress. And I hope we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A brief word about cloture. Look: anybody who has been in the Senate for more than a week will tell you--if they are being honest--that 40 or so cloture votes in 6 months isn't a sign of minority obstruction; it is a sign of a majority that doesn't like the rules. The cloture club shouldn't be the first option. It should be the last. Hopefully today's vote is also a sign that we are moving away from cloture as a first resort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the majority will follow through on a pledge that the senior Senator from Illinois made on the first day of the session. He said the American people put Democrats in the majority "to find solutions, not to play to a draw with nothing to show for it." Very well said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Republican colleagues hope we can operate this way. I think it will be the best way to operate in the fall if we actually intend to legislate.</paragraph>
