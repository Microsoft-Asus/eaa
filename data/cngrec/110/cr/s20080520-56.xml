    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the 90th birthday of Mr. Squire Rudolph Broel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native South Dakotan, Squire was born in Lesterville, SD, on May 29, 1918, to Rudolph and May Broel. Upon graduation from Lesterville High School in 1936, Squire was employed in various jobs throughout the area including at the Stuelpnagals Chicken Hatchery. On June 24, 1940, Squire married another Lesterville native Evelyn Hladky and they would eventually have three children: Larry Broel, Carolyn McDonald, and Jean Lehn. During World War II Squire served in the Army Air Corps and for most  of his service was stationed in Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon after his discharge and return to South Dakota, Squire and his family moved to Sturgis, SD, where he still lives today. It was in Sturgis, that Squire became a fireman at the Fort Meade Veterans Hospital in 1951. He worked there until his retirement in 1978, and during that time he earned many awards, including the Veterans Hospital Civil Service Award for South Dakota in 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his retirement from Fort Meade, Squire continued to serve as a fireman for the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department and in 1985 he was honored by the Governor of South Dakota for his 50 years of fire service with the proclamation of "Squire Broel Day" throughout the State. In 1994, Squire earned the South Dakota Outstanding Fire Service Award. During his career as a fireman Squire was also a member of the Black Hills Safety Council, the South Dakota Fire Chiefs Association, and the Keep  South Dakota Green Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now officially retired from the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department, Squire remains active with numerous volunteer activities and in various civic organizations. He also enjoys hunting, watching baseball, traveling, and spending time with his five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to commemorate the 90th birthday of Squire Broel and to wish him continued health and happiness in the years to come.</paragraph>
