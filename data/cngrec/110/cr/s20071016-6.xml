  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12885">S12885</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning business for an hour. The time will be equally divided and controlled. The Republicans have the first half. We have the second half. Following morning business, Senators MIKULSKI and SHELBY, as managers of the bill, will resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, I indicated we would work and complete this bill, either tonight or in the morning--and by "in the morning," I mean after midnight. We are going to work until we complete this bill, if, in fact, it is ever going to be completed. I am not filing cloture on the legislation. We have a finite number of amendments, and we are going to work through these amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated last night, we have had good cooperation from the minority on our appropriations bills, and I hope that continues. I am confident it will. But if anyone who is mischievous thinks they will stop us from voting tonight, we will have votes. I do not need to be voting on these matters of this bill. If people think they can stop us from voting, we will have votes. Even if we have to instruct the Sergeant at Arms or do whatever is necessary, we are going to have votes tonight, unless  this bill moves forward more quickly than some have said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to complete this legislation. We have things that are so very important. The President yesterday said he wants appropriations bills. We cannot do the appropriations bills unless we have cooperation from Democrats and Republicans. Right now, we have 29 amendments that are here that Republicans want to deal with. There are eight Democratic amendments. We want to get this bill done. We need to do Labor-HHS, and, hopefully, by that time we can have something ready to send to the President--any  one of the six bills we would have passed. I think it is important we get this process done. The President said he wants to veto a bill. We will send him one he wants to veto if, in fact, that is what he wants to do. Hopefully, that may not be the case. But if it is, that is where we have to start with him. So there are going to be votes. There probably will be votes before our 12:30 mandated recess time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other items we need to work on. For example, one reason we need to finish this bill and the Labor-HHS bill is the manager of the farm bill is Harkin from Iowa, and we have to have him free so he can do the markup of the farm bill next week--a very important piece of legislation. In the Democratic caucus--I do not know of the Republican caucus--more than half of the Democrats are vitally interested in the farm bill because it affects their States. We have to do a farm bill.  We have not done one in 5 years. I think it would be negligent on our part to leave here without doing a farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many important issues. There are people who want to change  the standard farm bill we have done in years past. This is what legislating is all about. It is extremely important we work toward completing this legislation. So that is why we have the press we are having now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say, after we finish this week, we only have 4 weeks left until Thanksgiving, and then we have 2 weeks we will be out for Thanksgiving, and then, if we come back, we are going to have only 3 weeks before Christmas. We have a lot to do. I will not go through the list of what we are obligated to do, but it is a lot of stuff. I hope everyone would understand that and be thoughtful and considerate of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may have to work some late nights. We may have to work some weekends. We have been very fortunate this whole year. We talked about working weekends a lot, and we have not had to do it except on a couple of occasions. The reason we have not had to do it more is because of the press of the weekend coming upon us we get our work done. That may be the case this week. I hope so. But if not, everyone should understand, if they have obligations at home, they better have some alternatives or consider  missing some votes.</paragraph>
