    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize and welcome Dr. Danny Davis, the senior pastor at Mount Hermon Baptist Church in Danville, Virginia. He is accompanied today by his wife of 30 years, Sandy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Davis was born in Tennessee and grew up in Williamsburg, Kentucky. Having served in the ministry since 1985, he has pastored churches in Kentucky, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia. Not only does Dr. Davis have a heart for service in his local community but also for ministry through missions at home and abroad. He has been involved in multiple mission trips to Tanzania, Russia, Honduras, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, the United Kingdom, Greece and even Communist Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Davis' only son, Jordan, has served as a member of my staff for the past 3 years. Jordan's hard work and dedication have helped me to better serve my constituents. I know I have Dr. Davis to thank for having instilled in his son the same values he displays in his ministry as well as the importance of service to others and his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Dr. Davis for being here today and offering today's prayer and I wish him continued success in his ministry.</paragraph>
