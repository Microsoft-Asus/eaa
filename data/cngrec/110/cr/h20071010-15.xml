    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, President Bush used his veto pen to strike down a bill that would provide health coverage to 10 million children. In explaining his veto, the President used rhetoric that has no basis in reality. The President claims that the focus of the SCHIP should be on poor children rather than to expand the program. But the fact is this bill does not expand the program, it simply allows for the coverage of more kids who are already eligible. As Republican Senator Hatch  pointed out, for those who argue that it's out of control, 92 percent of all the kids who will be covered by this bill will be families under 200 percent of the poverty level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President also falsely says that the bill would cover kids in families earning $83,000 per year, but no State covers kids at that level now, and the bill actually reduces Federal support for coverage of children at higher income levels. The President's claims are simply wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the question now for House Republicans is, are they going to stand behind the President's false claims about the children's health bill, or will they join us in overriding the President's veto?</paragraph>
