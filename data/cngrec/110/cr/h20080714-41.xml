  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the 1970s our Nation was held hostage by OPEC starting an oil embargo that drove up gasoline prices and damaged the American economy. Today it's not OPEC holding us hostage but rather the Democratic majority that refuses to expand domestic energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents are hurting, $4.10 a gallon of gasoline for regular, smaller boxes of cereal, diesel prices are through the roof hurting those truckers and higher prices for air conditioning bills. All of these increased costs shrink the wallets of working Americans and hurt even more the seniors on fixed incomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When will this majority wake up and realize that 73 percent of America approves of drilling? When will the majority admit that their energy policy will do nothing at all to lower prices at the pump?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, ideas to raise the gas tax 50 cents when we are in the midst of a national gasoline crisis are a bad joke pushed on the American public. We need to support our constituents and support drilling.</paragraph>
