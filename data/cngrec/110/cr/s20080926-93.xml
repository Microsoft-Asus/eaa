  <narrative>HONORING EDWARD R. JOHNSON -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9648">S9648</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday morning I met Edward Johnson of Springdale, AR, who was selected by Experience Works, the Nation's oldest and largest provider of job training and employment opportunities for older Americans, as the 2008 Outstanding Older Worker from the State of Arkansas. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Johnson on receiving this award and thank him for his steadfast service to our country and my home State of Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 60 years ago, as an 18-year-old young man, Mr. Johnson enlisted in the U.S. Army. Over the next 30 years, he served our country in outposts from Japan and Korea to the Panama Canal and Vietnam. Upon his honorable discharge in 1978, he had earned the rank of sergeant major.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without knowing what his next step in life would be, Mr. Johnson went to his local employment office to apply for unemployment benefits. Upon arriving, he found his second calling and began a second 30-year career as the local veterans representative in the Fayetteville office for the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services, DWS. In this capacity, Mr. Johnson has assisted countless veterans find employment and helped disabled veterans find uses for their unique talents. He has said that the  pleasure of putting veterans to work and their excitement when hired is what motivates him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his service, he has become like a father figure and invaluable member of the DWS staff. It is not uncommon for him to go above and beyond to assist in a variety of capacities around the office. He is known to mentor new employees, especially veterans in the work/study program, and takes it upon himself to recognize colleagues with awards when they provide an outstanding level of service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 78, Mr. Johnson is showing no signs of slowing down, either. He continues to learn how to use the newest technology needed to perform his job. He also likes to treat the staff by grilling hamburgers and hotdogs in the parking lot or bringing in his wife's homemade soup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his work, Mr. Johnson is a valuable member of his community. He is a 23-year member of the Noon Lions Club, where he served as president from 1988 to 1989, and in 1999, he served as the Rogers-Lowell Chamber of Commerce Ambassador of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want Mr. Johnson to know that he is an inspiration, not only to me and my colleagues but to the millions of seniors around our great State and across this country. We are thankful for his many contributions.</paragraph>
