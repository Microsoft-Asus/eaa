  <narrative>THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT -- (Senate - March 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1992">S1992</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the morning of February 23, 2008, Melbourne Brunner and his partner were eating at the Floridian restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, FL, when they were verbally and physically assaulted. According to Brunner, a man at the restaurant began calling the couple antigay slurs, threatening to break their necks and kill them. After a few moments of suffering the man's insults, Brunner and his partner decided to leave. When Brunner attempted to enter his car, the man came from behind him, blocked his path,  and struck Brunner in the face, causing him to hit his head on the pavement. The assailant then reportedly walked back to his  car, covered up the license plate with his shirt so that his tags would not be identified, and sped away. The owner of the Floridian restaurant is offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the capture of this suspect. Brunner was treated at a local hospital for severe bruising around his eyes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
