    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the weekend I saw a couple of movies that everybody in this House ought to see: One is "Charlie Wilson's War," which is about the Afghan war and driving the Russians out; and the second is "Kite Runner," which is a movie about trying to rescue one orphan in the Afghan situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 15th of December, on Saturday, in a conference in Baghdad, it was announced that there are 5 million orphans created by the United States of America's war on Iraq. Maybe they are off by a million; maybe it's only 4 million. But when you see that movie "Kite Runner," just imagine that being 4 million kids that are our responsibility because we invaded a country under false pretenses and we are continuing to leave a mess. Five million orphans at Christmastime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Merry Christmas, everyone.</paragraph>
