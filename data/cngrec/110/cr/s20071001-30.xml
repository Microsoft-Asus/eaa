  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="RETIREMENT OF RICK DIEGEL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the distinguished career of a man who has devoted his life to improving the welfare of working men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Diegel hails from Texas, where he worked as a journeyman wireman and foreman. He served his country in the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1968, and is a veteran of the Vietnam War. He also served three terms as the mayor pro-tem of the City of Ingleside, Texas, and was elected business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 278 in Corpus Christie in 1977. He held this post until 1983, when he was appointed to the International Office of IBEW as the director of their  Committee on Political Education. In 1998, he became director of the Political/Legislative Department, a position he has held to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly four decades, Rick has fought to improve the working and living standards for our Nation's workers. As director at the International Office, Rick spearheaded the modern political program of the union, and transformed the way that unions effect legislative change. He worked to get more IBEW members elected to office than any other union, and he established a full-time grassroots mobilization program at IBEW to give even a louder voice to workers' needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Rick has been a forceful advocate for the approximately 750,000 members who work in a wide variety of fields, including utilities, construction, telecommunications, broadcasting, manufacturing, railroads and government. Rick has served as a powerful champion for the labor movement, not only because he was a skillful advocate on behalf of workers, but also because he encouraged workers to make their individual voices heard. Rick understood the importance of workers engaging  in the political process to elect members who made workers' rights a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Diegel is a dear friend and an invaluable ally in the fight to support America's workers. He has left an indelible mark on the country he has served his entire life, and he has improved the lives of millions of workers. I wish him a retirement full of health and happiness.</paragraph>
