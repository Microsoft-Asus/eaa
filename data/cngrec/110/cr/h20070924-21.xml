    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="663">H. Res. 663</bill>, a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="663">H. Res. 663</bill>, which has 57 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative John Kline on September 19, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="663">H. Res. 663</bill> was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on September 20, 2007, by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1899, veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection were upset by the poor treatment they received following their return from America's first major overseas conflict. As a result, the American Veterans of Foreign Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines were established to advocate for the rights and benefits then denied to veterans of foreign conflicts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1914, these veteran organizations, recognizing their common goals and the importance of unity, merged to form the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW, of the United States. In the 108 years since the VFW's founding, members have proudly carried on the organization's mission of ensuring rights, remembering sacrifices, promoting patriotism, performing community services, and advocating for a strong national defense. The VFW has advocated for our Nation's veterans to include helping establish the  present-day Department of Veterans Affairs, creating the Montgomery GI Bill of Rights, developing the national cemetery system, and assisting combat-wounded veterans in receiving compensation for their injuries for service to our Nation. I support the goals and ideas of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day, which honors our veterans' achievements and their service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative John Kline, for introducing this legislation, and I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the present-day Veterans of Foreign Wars organization traces its origin to 1899 when two organizations were founded to achieve benefits and recognition for United States veterans of the Spanish-American War. These veterans were committed to ensuring that their efforts in that conflict were recognized, honored, and respected by their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the United States became involved in later foreign conflicts, the number of members of the VFW grew. The VFW received its congressional charter in 1936. Currently, there are 2.3 million members of the VFW and the Ladies Auxiliary. Efforts by the VFW were instrumental in establishing a Department of Veterans Affairs, the GI Bill, the national cemetery system, and assisting combat-wounded veterans to receive compensation for their injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of their achievements in peacetime and the role of its members in wartime, I would ask that my colleagues honor the VFW and declare a Veterans of Foreign Wars Day. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting House Resolution 663.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no further requests for time. I think there is no doubt there is no greater group of citizens in our country than those who have served and fought in foreign wars. I urge swift passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a lifetime member of VFW Post 210 in Lakeville, Minnesota, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="663">H. Res. 663</bill>, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VFW traces its roots back to 1899, when veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection founded local organizations to secure rights and benefits for their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before that time, many of our veterans would return home wounded or sick. There was no medical care or veterans' pension for them, and they were left to care for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The founders of the VFW sought to remedy that and provide support and encouragement to all of our veterans who had served in foreign wars. Their mission statement was straightforward, "to honor the dead by helping the living." Over time their mission expanded to "ensuring rights, remembering sacrifices, promoting patriotism, performing community services, and advocating for a strong national defense."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have a rich history of advocacy. The VFW has been instrumental in establishing the Veterans Administration, creating a GI bill for the 20th century, the development of the national cemetery system, and the fight to ensure combat wounded veterans from all wars receive proper compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, they have been a powerful force behind the creation of the Vietnam, Korean War, World War II and Women in Military Service Memorials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the organization has grown to more than 2.3 million members worldwide and continues to advocate for all of our foreign veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the work of these individuals. Their continued commitment to each other and this great country of ours is truly inspirational. I am humbled by the work they have done for our veterans and I am honored to be bringing this resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we stand to celebrate the establishment and achievements of an organization that was born of patriotism, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, I would ask each of my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="663">H. Res. 663</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work the Members the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 696 in Owensboro, Kentucky continue to do to improve their community. Post 696 has exemplified the mission of the VFW: Honor the dead by helping the living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Post has donated over $22,000 to local and state organizations in the past year. Beneficiaries of their generosity have included local schools, the Boy Scouts, shelters, and churches. Their generosity has also been extended to organizations such as the Wendell Foster Center, Shriners Hospitals, the Children's Wish Foundation, the Disabled American Veterans, and JEVCO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Post 696 recently sponsored a going away picnic for the members of Ft. Campbell's Alpha Troop and their families being deployed to Iraq. The City of Owensboro adopted Alpha Troop through the Americans Supporting Americans' Adopt-a-Unit-Program. I thank the members of the troop for their service and the City of Owensboro for this commitment to these brave soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VFW Post 696 Honor/Color Guard has been busy serving the community as well. Since 2001, they have participated in over 400 Veteran funerals and 50 community events in Daviess County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the leaders of Post 696 Commander Richard "Ike" Eisenmenger Jr., Ladies Auxiliary President Marilu Goodsell, and Color/Honor Guard Commander Joseph Hayden. They have worked tirelessly to serve veterans and improve their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my privilege to honor the members of VFW Post 696 today, before the entire United States House of Representatives, for their past service to our country and continued dedication to serving their community.</paragraph>
