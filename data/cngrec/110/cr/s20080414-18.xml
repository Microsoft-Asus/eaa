    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to call the attention of the Senate to the 50th Anniversary of a remarkable organization that boasts 35 million members, for whom it provides services ranging from discounted prescription drugs, to travel services, to financial services. Most of us on Capitol Hill are far more familiar with this organization as the tireless advocate for the interests of Americans over the age of 50. The organization, of course, is AARP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its half-century of service, the organization that we know today as AARP has been transformed from its modest beginnings in 1958 when Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus, a retired high school principal, transformed the National Retired Teachers' Organization into the American Association for Retired Persons. The organization was known under this name until 1999 when it became just AARP to reflect the fact that many of its members are still active in the labor force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Characteristic of the work of AARP over the past 50 years has been its efforts to influence national policy on behalf of the well being of Americans over the age of 50 and to defend the programs that protect them, especially Social Security and Medicare. More recently, AARP has spearheaded the effort to get bipartisan action in Congress to provide all Americans with health care and long-term financial security with its Divided We Fail campaign. I commend AARP for its outstanding leadership on  these issues, which are so critical to millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Bush in 2005, fresh from his election victory, made the privatization of Social Security his top domestic priority, he met his match in AARP, which mobilized its members to oppose this very risky plan. Congressional Democrats worked very closely with AARP in that effort, and in the end we were successful, at least temporarily. Unfortunately, given the continuing support for privatization among many in Washington, that battle will have to continue in the years ahead, and I look  forward to working closely with AARP to continue to make the case against privatization, and to make sure that America keeps its promise to our seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I offer a cordial birthday greeting to an organization that is 50 years old and stronger than ever. AARP has kept pace with the needs of mature Americans and, more importantly, it has kept faith with them. In the process, it has made this country a better place for all Americans.</paragraph>
