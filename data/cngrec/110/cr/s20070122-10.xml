    <paragraph>Once again, I thank Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN for their efforts last week on the lobbying reform bill. I think the 96-to-2 vote Thursday night pretty well sums up the broad bipartisan support we had for this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the minimum wage, I encourage Members on our side to come to the floor today not only to debate the package but to also offer their amendments. I hope we can have a full, constructive debate as Members offer their various proposals to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me ask my friend, the majority leader, did he indicate that the first vote will probably be before the policy luncheons?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As the majority leader indicated, we have a number of different interruptions this week, not the least of which is the State of the Union tomorrow night, which will truncate the amount of time we have on the floor. I think the best way to get started is for Members to come over and offer their amendments, get them in the queue, and let's get started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
