    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill> was introduced by our colleague from Arizona, the chairman of the National Parks, Forests and Public  Land Subcommittee, Representative RA&#xDA;L GRIJALVA. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, America's Historical and National Legacy Study Act, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study nine sites to determine the best way to preserve and interpret them, including an evaluation of whether they merit inclusion in the National Park System or the National Trails System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special resource studies are an important tool in preserving and interpreting the Nation's natural and cultural history. Even if a study concludes that involvement of the Federal Government is not recommended, these studies provide important information and options for the local, the State, or the private landowners charged with managing these resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, hearings have been held on eight of the measures included in this legislation over the course of this year. The ninth study passed the House in the last Congress. These study proposals have been sponsored or cosponsored by more than 50 of our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans. The studies range geographically from California to Puerto Rico and from President Truman's birthplace to Lewis and Clark's expedition of discovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, special resource studies are some of the most common and popular types of legislation that our colleagues ask the Natural Resources Committee to consider. So we are happy to recommend these worthy study proposals to the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While <bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill> contains titles that are a concern to some, it also contains studies that are worthy of special recognition for the effort and diligence that their sponsors put into them. In particular, I would like to thank Representative Boozman and his staff for their hard work on the Butterfield Overland Trail Study Act. Congressman Boozman reached out to all Members whose districts will be a part of this study and made sure that they had no objections. He also ensured that  all private property rights would be protected. His actions are exemplary and should be commended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the time being yielded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the processes of this particular bill is one that I hope we do not replicate very often because indeed there are nine separate bills tied together into one package. Each bill has a separate amount of merits to those particular bills. Some of them, like the bill by Mr. Skelton, the chairman from Missouri, is a very well-written bill. I particularly would like to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) for writing a bill that I think went above and  beyond the call of duty in trying to ensure that the rights of citizens who would be in this study area are protected, as well as ensuring that the maximum amount of participation can be given to those people who are living in that particular area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also some elements in the bill as it came out of committee that I found personally egregious. Those have been removed from the bill that is here. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee and the subcommitees respectively as well as Democratic staff for making changes in this particular bill in a way that I find very appealing. I appreciate them for entering into discussions in an effort to find some kind of bipartisan cooperation with this, and I also am very appreciative  of the professional manner in which the Democrat staff worked with our staff in coming up with a bill that I think is very positive coming out of here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the bill that is now before us, I certainly have no objections to this particular bill, and I wish to express my appreciation for putting this particular piece of legislation in a form that I think is commendable, and we can commend it and represent it and encourage our fellow Members of the House to vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill>, in particular title X of the bill, the Butterfield Overland Trail Study Act. This title directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the Butterfield Overland Trail, which stretches from Missouri to California. Before the railroad and even the famed Pony Express, the Butterfield Trail was the only connection between the eastern United States and the rapidly expanding west coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Commissioned by Congress in 1857, John Butterfield established a trail that could be traveled by stagecoach from the Mississippi River to San Francisco in a remarkable 25 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the original purpose of the trail has long been surpassed by modern technology, the trail survives with the potential to be a great link to our Nation's past, attracting tourists with its educational and historic appeal, as well as a tool to educate our children about our country's storied history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with the National Resources Committee to ensure that extreme caution is given to protecting private property rights, and clear language is contained in the bill so that any future action will not compromise private land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as our country continues to rapidly grow and develop in the spirit of the old American West, it is so important that we remember what brought us to this point. It is our duty to our children and grandchildren that we take the time to mark the paths our ancestors took across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respectfully ask my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill>. And I want to thank the committee so much, and the committee staff. It has really been a pleasure to work with you guys to help us as we worked forward in ironing out the kinks.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for the generous grant of time and I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of the America's Historical and National Legacy Study Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes studies into the suitability of 10 sites as candidates for the National Park System. It is the first step towards preserving some of our most important historical sights and some of our most precious national resources, many of which are vulnerable to development unless we act, and act now. One of the 10 sites is located in the heart of my district, the Battle of Camden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced the Battle of Camden Study Act in the 108th Congress, and I am thankful that Congress is now finally considering it as part of this National Legacy Study Act. This site has been a national historic landmark since 1962, but it does not enjoy the support and protection offered by being an official unit of the National Park System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Battle of Camden was fought on August 16, 1780, and was a crushing defeat for American patriot forces. Indeed, some regard it as the high watermark of British supremacy in the Southern colonies. So it's fair to ask, if this battle was such a crushing defeat for the American patriots, why should we commemorate it at all?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, to start with, this battle was lost by General Horatio Gates. The hero of Saratoga was a political favorite in the Continental Congress, and after the fall of Charleston, the Congress sent him south to command what remained of our forces. Congress appointed Gates without consulting Washington, who would have sent Nathaniel Greene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gates came and drove his ill-provisioned troops into battle even after discovering that Cornwallis had reinforced his ranks the day before with fresh troops from Charleston. The result was a rout, a disaster, and a retreat to Charlotte led by Gates himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For its part, the Congress learned from this bitter experience its proper role in assigning general officers, and years later that principle was built into the Constitution. In replacing Gates after the Battle of Camden, Congress deferred to Washington and Washington dispatched Greene to the Carolinas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Charleston and then Camden subdued, Cornwallis began a drive north to mop up resistance with Major Ferguson on the west side of the Broad River and General Cornwallis on the east.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Battle of Camden left new doubts about local militia, and how reliable or effective they could be, other than to harass British troops. But as Cornwallis' forces moved through the upcountry, they learned the Carolina patriot militia could not be taken lightly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ferguson made his way through the foothills of the Blue Ridge, he threatened to apply "fire and steel" to anyone who refused allegiance to the crown. Settlers from over the mountain got the message. More than a thousand mustered at Sycamore Shoals for a fight with Ferguson. On October 7, 1780, they found Ferguson encamped on the top of Kings Mountain; and after settling on tactics, they attacked systematically. In less than an hour, Ferguson was dead, and hundreds of his troops were also  dead, wounded or taken prisoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kings Mountain is widely regarded as the turning point of the Revolution in the South, but we cannot fully appreciate its significance unless we understand its context, the Battles of Camden and Charleston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three months later, Morgan would meet Tarleton at Hannah's Cowpens, just 15 miles from Kings Mountain. Tarleton's defeat at Cowpens and Cornwallis' pursuit of Morgan into Virginia would eventually lead Cornwallis to Yorktown in total defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Revolutionary War was a very near thing which could easily have gone either way, and that's why the Battle of Camden is so essential to understanding the Revolutionary War. The Continentals and the patriots may have lost that battle, but they learned from bitter experience and came back to fight and win another day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the committee, in particular Chairmen Rahall and Grijalva, Ms. Bordallo, and my good colleague from South Carolina, HENRY BROWN, for including the Battle of Camden in your bill; and I encourage every Member to vote for the adoption of this fine piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me take this means to express my support for <bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill>, which includes a piece of legislation entitled the "Harry S. Truman Birthplace Study Act," which I introduced on July 31, 2007. That particular bill would direct the Interior Secretary to study the feasibility of adding the Harry S. Truman Birthplace State Historic Site in Lamar, MO, to our system of National Parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was honored to introduce this legislation on behalf of the people of Lamar, a community located in Southwestern Missouri that has done much groundwork for the inclusion of the State Historic Site in our Federal system. The bill would further honor the 33rd President of the United States and Missouri's favorite son, President Harry S. Truman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 8, 1884, Harry Truman was born in a downstairs bedroom of a small frame house in Lamar, MO. The Truman birthplace, which the family occupied until Harry was 11 months old, was built between 1880 and 1882. In 1959, the United Auto Workers donated the home to the State of Missouri, after buying it some years earlier to preserve its rich cultural significance. Since its addition to the Missouri State Parks System, much work has been done to maintain the dignity and historical relevance of  the residence, and many Americans make their way through the site each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Mayor of Lamar, Keith Divine, wrote to me earlier this year asking me to introduce legislation to begin the process of including President Truman's birthplace in our National Park System, I was honored to oblige. In my view and in the view of the local community, doing so would add perhaps the most critical piece of Harry Truman's life, the place of his birth, to the current group of national historic sites that honor the legacy of our 33rd President. And, doing so would foster economic  development in Lamar and in Barton County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of record, let me share with you briefly my personal connection with President Truman and with the legislation creating the original Harry S. Truman National Historic Site in Independence, MO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to personally know President Truman through my father, Ike Skelton, Sr., who developed a friendship with him some 78 years ago at the dedication of the Pioneer Mother Statue--the Madonna of the Trail--located in my hometown of Lexington, MO. At that time, Harry Truman was a county commissioner in neighboring Jackson County and my father was a well-known lawyer and Democrat. Through the years, I developed my own friendship with this genuinely nice person we call the "Man from Independence."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a son of rural Missouri whose handshake was firm, whose honesty and personal integrity were never questioned, and whose devotion to his beloved wife, Bess, to his daughter Margaret Truman Daniel, and to his friends was enduring. He led our country through some difficult periods and made courageous, principled decisions during his presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, Congress has honored President Truman by designating sites in Missouri important to his life as part of America's National Park System. In 1982 and 1983, I worked with the late Senator Tom Eagleton and former Senator Jack Danforth to pass legislation designating the home of Harry and Bess Truman in Independence, MO, as the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site. The site, which consisted at that time of President and Mrs. Truman's home at 219 N. Delaware Street, was willed to the  Archivist of the United States when Mrs. Truman passed away in October 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the National Park Service, rather than the Archivist, has the Federal responsibility of administering national historic sites, the property and its historic contents became stuck in limbo, with only minimal protection and threatened by possible vandalism, theft, or fire. At that time, there was an urgent need to protect this important property, so I requested the Secretary of the Interior to exercise his authority to designate and administer President Truman's home as a national historic  site. The Department refused, and I quickly introduced legislation to establish the site. My bill passed the House on December 13, 1982, but the Senate failed to act on it before the end of the session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the Interior Secretary came to his senses and signed a secretarial order designating the home as a national historic site. In 1983, however, I wrote legislation to codify the Secretary's directive. In May 1983, Congress unanimously approved and President Ronald Reagan signed into law my bill that created the Harry S. Truman National Historic Site in Independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, Congress has authorized the National Park Service to add other historically significant Truman family sites to the Federal property--in 1989, additional family homes near 219 Delaware Street and in 1993, the Truman Farm Home near Grandview, MO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, here we are on December 4, 2007, considering my legislation to direct the Interior Secretary to study whether it is feasible to include another important historic site--President Truman's birthplace--to our National Park System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who cherishes the life and legacy of Harry Truman, I am hopeful this bill will become law and that the National Park Service's study will proceed quickly and will yield favorable results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Lamar, the State of Missouri, and the University of Missouri Extension have put into place a development plan for the Harry S. Truman Birthplace State Historic Site. If approved, I am confident the Federal study will look favorably upon the community's work and will take into consideration the positive economic impact for the Lamar and Barton County area, which has experienced considerable economic hardship in recent months because a major employer, O'Sullivan Industries, closed  its doors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to approve <bill type="h" number="3998">H.R. 3998</bill> today.</paragraph>
