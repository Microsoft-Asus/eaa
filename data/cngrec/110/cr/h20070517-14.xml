    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, though I am only in my fifth month of service in this Chamber, I have developed a deep admiration and respect for the men and women in this body. But, frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that the new House leadership has been inflicted with a severe case of amnesia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of 2005, the then Democratic minority in the House released a report accusing the then Republican majority leadership of abusing their power through parliamentary tactics designed to suppress dissent. The same leadership that published that report over 2 years ago pledged, at the beginning of this very year, to run the "most honest, most open, and most ethical Congress" in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday these leaders attempted to change a 185-year-old House rule to dramatically increase taxes and government spending against the will of the minority party and the American people. Is this really the way to run the self-proclaimed most honest and most open Congress in America's history?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While House leadership may suffer from amnesia, the American people most certainty do not, and bending the rules to pass egregious tax-and-spend policies will not stand in this people's House.</paragraph>
