  <narrative>STIMULUS BILL -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9570">S9570</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as all of us are aware, J.P. Morgan has agreed to buy Washington Mutual, which is based in my home State of Washington. I have been in touch with J.P. Morgan and with WaMu about their plans, and I have been assured that the transition will go smoothly and that Washington Mutual's banking customers will not see any interruption in service. And that is good news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is, of course, still too early to know the impact of the failure of WaMu, the Nation's largest thrift, will have on local jobs, but it is further evidence to me that the economic crisis has spilled over into our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very saddened that it is having an impact on families and our economy, and yet it is another sign that we must find a bipartisan solution now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working together quickly to reach an agreement. We have rejected the President's $700 billion blank check because it did not ensure oversight or protection for our taxpayers. But Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are working with the House Democrats, the Treasury, and the Fed to come up with a solution that keeps this crisis from hitting more communities. We are hopeful that the House Republicans will come to the table and work with us on a solution that protects American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we do this, I firmly believe we must also offer the American people a hand and help get our economy going in communities across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now have an opportunity today to help millions of struggling families who are grasping for a lifeline as this economy sustains blow after blow. Long before this economic crisis rippled across our financial system, middle-class families were already reeling under the impact of failed policies that were implemented by President Bush and backed by John McCain, and it is critical that we act now to help those families, those small businesses, State and local governments get back on their  feet. The bill I am hoping we will vote on shortly will do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill brings security to seniors who are facing a stack of medical bills they cannot afford to pay and offers help to families who have seen the value of their homes drop below the amount they owe. It ensures that the most vulnerable Americans can continue to put food on their table and keep a roof over their heads. It creates jobs at a time when billions of workers have been laid off and billions more are worried that their job is going to be next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush-McCain economic philosophy of "hands off" has done its damage. It is time that we now put the interests of the American people first again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill I hope we will vote on shortly will do just that. I wish to take a few minutes this morning to underscore the importance of what that bill will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, dropping home values and dwindling business revenues have put our State governments under extraordinary financial stress at a time when they can least afford it. As a result of the White House's failed policies, Republican and Democratic Governors across the country are now facing drastic cuts in services from health care to education to law enforcement, and they are looking and asking for relief from Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already, State-supported health clinics and hospitals are closing, schools are pushing more and more students on fewer teachers, and fully trained police officers are being asked to hand in their badges because their departments can no longer afford to keep them on the beat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will allocate about $20 billion to help our States continue to provide the services on which our citizens depend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, this package puts workers on the job immediately by providing $8 billion for highway projects in every one of our States. As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, I have been watching with dismay as the construction sector of our economy has endured hundreds of thousands of layoffs over the last several months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Construction jobs play a critical role in our economy. They provide a living wage that enables those families to keep food on their tables. But the construction industry is now facing its highest unemployment rate in 13 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of months ago, an estimated 783,000 jobless laborers, carpenters, plumbers, pipefitters, and other tradesmen were looking for work wherever they could find it. With that in mind and watching that happen, I helped to work to craft a transportation and housing infrastructure package that is in this bill that addresses our most critical needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It requires that we spend the money fast so that we will see an immediate impact on our economy in every one of our communities. Every State across this Nation has a highway, transit, or airport maintenance project that is ready to go to construction, but they lack the money to buy the rebar or purchase the timber or order the concrete or even pay the workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill we will be considering will allow those projects to get up and running right now when we desperately need those jobs. This funding will create more than 278,000 family-wage jobs in a sector that has taken it on the chin over the last year, and it does it fairly and it does it responsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires those highway dollars be spent according to the formula that was established in our SAFETEA-LU highway law. There are no earmarks, no special projects. States have to use these dollars within 90 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, all of us have heard about the increasing demand for public transportation as gas prices have gone through  the roof. For example, Amtrak, our Nation's railroad, continues to set records now for its ridership. Well, the bill we are considering makes urgently needed investments in Amtrak and mass transit. It provides $2.35 billion in funding to improve and expand our bus and rail systems, including $350 million to repair railcars and make other necessary  improvements to the Amtrak network. Most importantly, that will put another 70,000 Americans back to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes $400 million for capital projects at our Nation's airports and $44 million to modernize our Nation's shipyards to make them competitive and efficient. It provides money to ensure that Americans who rely on public housing will continue to have a roof over their heads. It will help address a growing problem in our communities--renters who have lost their homes because their landlords were foreclosed on. This bill includes $200 million to help those tenants find immediate  shelter and long-term housing. It includes $250 million so our public housing authorities can rebuild those vacant units and fill those units with needy tenants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill will increase benefits for those jobless Americans who, at a time when unemployment is at the highest since 2003, need to know they can keep food on their tables. Our economy has bled jobs every single month this year. Hundreds of thousands of workers are wondering how they are going to pay their mortgages or pay for their food or their heat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The jobless rate now stands at 6.1 percent across the country, and it is worse in those States where manufacturing and auto industries have been faltering for years. This bill reaches out to those families by extending unemployment benefits by just 7 weeks across the country and 13 weeks in States where the jobless rate is the highest. And it invests in our workforce by helping those laid-off workers search for a new job or earn skills so they can go back into the job market and be competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also helps our teenagers get job experience and helps them find long-term employment. I want our colleagues to know teenagers are among the hardest hit by the economic crisis today. Almost 20 percent of our teenagers are unable to find a job, and the number is even higher among minorities. So it is critical that we enable these young people to get work experience now. Because if they lose out, they are less likely to move into a career later. Teens without jobs are more likely, as we all know,  to turn to crime or gangs in these difficult times, and that is going to cost our communities millions in law enforcement and lost productivity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill helps support part-time jobs after school, paid internships, and community service jobs for older youth. Those programs will pay off in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have talked about a few of the programs in this package which I believe are a critical shot in the arm to help our economy, and it is not going to come a moment too soon. The economic crisis we are facing is a direct result of failed policies by this President, this administration, in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are hearing now we need to bail out Wall Street. Well, this package before us will help the average citizen across our country get the security they need as they face this troubling crisis. I urge my colleagues to work with us to get to a vote and send a message across the country that we in the Senate and the Congress stand behind them, the working families in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith once wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two kinds of economists in the world: Those who don't know the future, and those who don't know that they don't know the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that sense, we are all economists now. We are all uncertain about our economic future. What we do know is that the stakes for our economic future are high, and we do know the economy is doing poorly right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the last 8 months, more than 600,000 people lost their jobs. Housing prices have been falling. Last month, the median home sales price fell 9 1/2  percent. That is the largest decline since recordkeeping began in 1999. The experts say we have not yet hit bottom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, there were more than 300,000 foreclosures. That is a 12-percent increase from the previous month and a 27-percent increase from the year before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumer confidence is low. Last December, the Conference Board's Index for consumer confidence was above 90. Now it is below 57. Last month, retail sales fell by three-tenths of a percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this downturn, Congress acted relatively early. In February, on a bipartisan basis, we passed an economic recovery bill and included in that bill was a tax rebate that put money in people's pockets. Lots of people spent that money, and the second quarter gross domestic product was larger than it otherwise would have been. But almost all those checks have now been sent and spent, and the economy is still in bad shape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need another economic recovery package, and that is what this bill would provide. This bill includes help for workers who have lost their jobs. It includes a further expansion in the number of weeks for unemployment benefits and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, Congress passed an extension of the number of weeks of unemployment benefits. That extension provided that those who had exhausted their regular 26 weeks of benefits would become eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits. We tried to add in a provision for another 13 weeks for those in high-unemployment States, but some of our colleagues and the President opposed that provision so it was dropped in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August, unemployment hit 6.1 percent. That is the highest level in 5 years. Well, here we are in September and the economy is still struggling. In fact, it is in worse shape. It is not easy to find a job that pays well. In October, for example, it is anticipated that 775,000 workers will exhaust the 13 weeks of additional benefits we provided in June. Another 363,000 workers will exhaust these benefits in November or December. That is a total of more than a million workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides for an extra 7 weeks of benefits in all States, and then it would make right what we could not do earlier this year, which is provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits for individuals who live in States where unemployment is higher than 6 percent. At the moment, that is 18 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also help areas that have been hit by Federal disasters. Under this bill, there would not be a waiting-week penalty when State-extended unemployment benefits kick in during times of disaster. This bill will provide much needed help for overburdened State unemployment systems. We are a society that cares about all its people. In hard economic times, giving additional weeks of unemployment benefits to people who cannot find a job is clearly the right action to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is another reason providing extra weeks of unemployment benefits will help stimulate the economy. People who are unemployed lose the income from their jobs. They generally don't have the income they need. So if they receive more money, they are likely to spend it; hence, unemployment benefits. When these unemployed workers spend their money, the folks who create the goods and services they buy will need more workers. Those workers will spend the earnings they get. The cycle goes on.  Economists call this the multiplier effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chief economist and cofounder of Moody's is Mark Zandi. He estimates that for every dollar of new unemployment benefits, the economy will grow by $1.64. Compared to other options to stimulate the economy, this option has a high bang for the buck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At times such as these, we need to extend the number of weeks of unemployment benefits. To help strengthen our economy, we also need to provide fiscal relief to State governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economy of a State has a major effect on the state government's budget. When a State's economy weakens, the State government's revenues generally fall off. In addition, as unemployment increases and incomes decline, more people become eligible for  assistance programs like Medicaid. And that increases the demand for State spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost all of the States have balanced budget requirements. During a time of economic weakness, when revenues drop and the need for expenditures increases, States may have to raise taxes or cut other spending in order to keep their budgets balanced. Unfortunately, that's precisely the wrong fiscal policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If a State raises taxes, it reduces the purchasing power of its residents and firms. And that can lead to further economic decline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reductions in State spending also lower the purchasing power of those persons or firms that would receive the State funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the current economic weakness is pressing many States to either raise taxes or cut spending. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 30 States had to take actions to reduce their budget deficits for fiscal year 2009, which began on July 1 of this year. And of these 30 States, 13 are facing additional budgetary shortfalls that appeared after they enacted their budgets. These 30 States are facing about $52 billion of shortfalls. If States raise taxes or cut spending  by that much, it would place a significant drag on the national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the last economic downturn, Congress increased the Federal matching rate for the Medicaid program by about 3 percentage points for five quarters. This freed up $10 billion for the States so that they did not have to cut Medicaid benefits. And that helped States to avoid cutting other expenditures or raising taxes. Most economists thought that this fiscal assistance measure for the States worked well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February, the Finance Committee reported out an economic recovery bill that included State fiscal assistance in the form of an increase in the Medicaid matching rate. Unfortunately, that provision was not agreed to on the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fiscal situation of the States is now worse than it was at the beginning of the year. And so, we should try to help the States. So this bill includes State fiscal relief in the form of an increase in the Medicaid matching rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains an across-the-board temporary increase of 4 percentage points in the Federal Medicaid matching rate. That would provide every State with much needed help. At a time of unprecedented fiscal crisis, I think that every State deserves this level of help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are historic economic times. We are all uncertain about the economic future. The stakes are high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us not be found wanting. Let us act to bolster the economy's recovery. And let us vote to advance this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid/Byrd economic stimulus package. Over the past week, congressional leaders have been working with administration officials to craft a bailout package for Wall Street. But if we are going to bail out Wall Street, we also need to help Main Street. The President's failed fiscal policies have resulted in higher unemployment, hardship in coping with rising food costs, higher energy costs, and increased dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the President thinks that a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street is good for America, he should certainly support a $56 billion investment program to create jobs on Main Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unemployment rate now stands at 6.1 percent, the highest rate since September 2003. The unemployment rate is up 1.4 percentage points since last August. The U.S. economy has lost jobs every month this year, a total of 605,000 jobs. The stimulus package extends unemployment benefits by 7 weeks in all States and another 13 weeks in high unemployment States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food prices have increased by 7.5 percent this year after increasing 4.9 percent in 2007. In order to help low-income individuals cope with rising food prices, the stimulus package temporarily increases Food Stamp benefits by 10 percent and includes $450 million for the Women, Infants, and Children--WIC--program, which would allow 625,000 women and children to receive benefits. $50 million is included for food banks, $30 million for the commodity supplemental food program, and $60 million for  senior meals programs, providing 18 million more meals to seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are consequences for failing to invest in America. Bridges fall into rivers. Roads and subways are congested to the breaking point. FEMA cannot respond to a major disaster. Fuel prices go through the roof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This stimulus package includes $10.8 billion for building and repairing highways, bridges, mass transit, airports, and AMTRAK, creating 384,000 jobs; $50 million for the Economic Development Administration to help communities impacted by massive job losses due to corporate restructuring; $500 million for the COPS program to hire 6,500 police officers; $600 million for clean water systems that would create 24,000 jobs; and $2 billion for school construction that would create 32,300 jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-nine States are facing a $52 billion shortfall in revenues in their fiscal year 2009 budgets, resulting in cuts in health care, education, and other programs. The stimulus package includes $19.6 billion to reduce the States' share of Medicaid costs by increasing the Federal share by 4 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy prices have increased by 22.4 percent in 2008. This stimulus bill includes major investments in promoting energy independence and a clean environment, including funds for advanced battery research, for local governments to improve energy efficiency, for environmental clean up, and weatherizing homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 22 percent of the world's energy supply is under the Arctic ice cap. The Russian President has stated that Russia should unilaterally claim part of the Arctic, stepping up the race for the disputed energy-rich region. We are not going to go along with that. No. Hell no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Russia has a fleet of 20 heavy icebreakers and is nearing completion of the first of their newest fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers in an effort to control energy exploration and maritime trade in the region. Thanks to the Bush administration, the United States has only one functioning heavy polar icebreaker, and it has only 6 years left of useful life. Shame. Mr. President, $925 million is included for the Coast Guard to provide what the Navy and the Air Force call, "an essential instrument  of U.S. policy" in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding is included to promote safety and energy efficiency in public housing, implement provisions of the recent housing law, give housing assistance to tenants displaced by foreclosure, and fund FBI investigations of fraud in the mortgage market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To promote education and job training, $2 billion is included for school repairs, $36 million for homeless education, and $400 million for the secure rural schools program. Job training funds would provide 160,000 dislocated workers and youth with training and job search assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, $1.2 billion is included for the National Institutes of Health. America's small businesses, the lifeblood of our economy, face an ever-tightening credit market in the wake of struggling financial markets. The stimulus provides $205 million to support $16 billion in reduced-fee loans to small businesses, delivering needed relief to small businesses on Main Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Senators to vote for this bill to send a message to the White House that Main Street matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that information relating to rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate be made a part of the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>The Constitution vests in the Congress the power of the purse. The Committee believes strongly that Congress should make the decisions on how to allocate the people's money.</narrative>
  <narrative>As defined in Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the term "congressional  directed spending item" means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Senator, providing, authorizing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to  a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative, formula-driven, or competitive award process.</narrative>
  <narrative>For each item, a Member is required to provide a certification that neither the Member nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in such congressionally directed spending item. Such certifications are available to the public on the website of the Senate Committee on Appropriations (www.appropriations.senate.gov/senators.cfm).</narrative>
  <narrative>Following is a list of congressionally directed spending items included in the Senate recommendation discussed in this report, along with the name of each Senator who submitted a request to the Committee of jurisdiction for each item so identified. Neither the Committee recommendation nor this report contains any limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as defined in rule XLIV.</narrative>

    <paragraph>I join in the statement of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, former majority leader and minority leader, assistant leader, secretary--no one has a more astounding and accomplished record in the Senate than Senator ROBERT BYRD of West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this will be the last time this year we will be able to vote on an economic recovery package. The plan we vote on today will provide targeted investments that will help working people now, not weeks or months from now. The dollars we invest in this legislation will come right back to our economy by creating jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and help small businesses grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With 605,000 jobs lost this year alone, this legislation extends unemployment benefits by 7 weeks across our country and by 13 weeks States with particularly high unemployment rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With States across America facing budget shortfalls as revenue dries up, this legislation provides funds to prevent State services like health care and education from deteriorating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We invest in energy efficiency and clean energy programs to help Americans switch to cleaner energy sources that will cost less as oil prices continue to reach record highs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We invest in our crumbling infrastructure, which will not only help small and large businesses but will create nearly 400,000 good jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We help Americans who are at risk of losing their homes by supporting the Federal Housing Administration, providing tools to stop mortgage fraud, and funding legal assistance for foreclosure prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also invests in job training, health care and small businesses to give our working Americans and our economy a desperately needed boost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before, Members of Congress from both parties will continue working as long as it takes to resolve the bailout legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we do not have to wait until that bill is passed and implemented to help struggling American families and businesses. I urge all my colleagues to support these wise investments in the places and people that need help the most.</paragraph>
