    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour. The Republicans will control the first half of time. We will control the second half of time. Following this period of morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. Senator Harkin and the ranking member, Senator Specter, will be here to move forward on this bill. If people have amendments, I hope they would do more than just think about them,  that they would come and offer them and debate them. A lot of work remains to be done on this bill and other measures that require the attention of the Senate.</paragraph>
