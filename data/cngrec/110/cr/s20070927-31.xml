  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my great honor to highlight the work of a devoted and difference-making West Virginian. Dennis Sutton, through his work in the Children's Home Society, has been a true asset to adoptive and foster parents and adoption agencies both in West Virginia and across the Nation. I would like to take a moment to highlight his service to his community and congratulate him on receiving the Congressional Adoption Caucus's Angel of Adoption Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the CEO of Children's Home Society of West Virginia, Dennis Sutton has dedicated his organization's program to securing loving homes for West Virginia's children in need--a derivative from his belief that every child is entitled to a loving family and home. Children's Home Society of West Virginia's utmost priority of bringing children and families together has been the result of more than 110 year experience, skilled and well-informed staff, certification by the National Council on Accreditation,  and readily available statewide service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dennis Sutton's commitment to our Nation's vulnerable children can be further seen in his participation as a founding member of Children's Home Society of America. A national organization, CHSA is comprised of the leading child welfare agencies across the country and aims to promote the safety, nurturing, and well-being of vulnerable children. This remarkable organization is working to make the adoption process easier for everyone involved but put children in the care of stable families, give  them the tools to succeed in today's world, and give them hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, it is clear that this kind of work merits the Angel in Adoption Award. Because of Children's Home Society of America, more than 250,000 children are now living in stable environments. That is an extraordinary accomplishment, one that will benefit our communities now and in the future. Dennis truly has been a passionate advocate for our children in need, has laid the groundwork for a better adoption process, and has put forth the bold vision to enrich and strengthen the fabric of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted to have had this opportunity to highlight not only the wonderful cause but the person who is working on this in my State of West Virginia. To Dennis and the Children's Home Society of America, I offer my most profound respects and deepest appreciation.</paragraph>
