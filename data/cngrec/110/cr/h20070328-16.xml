  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Democratic budget is receiving rave reviews from a broad variety of outside groups. Here are just some of the examples of what Democrats are hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Legion praised our budget because it includes $3.3 billion more for veterans than the President's budget, making it the largest veterans increase in 77 years. In the letter, the American Legion writes: "As a Nation at war, this funding will help cover the ongoing cost of war to care for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their families."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Academy of Pediatrics writes: "This budget includes a significant commitment to infants, children, adolescents and young adults through its funding of SCHIP and Medicaid."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the watchdog group OMB Watch writes: "We applaud its commitment to restoring fiscal responsibility by seeking to eliminate the Federal budget deficits by 2012, adopting the pay-as-you-go principle requiring that any new tax cuts and mandatory spending be paid for."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Democratic budget shows that we can fiscally be responsible while also meeting the critical needs of the American people. This budget deserves strong support.</paragraph>
