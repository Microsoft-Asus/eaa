    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Letcher, SD. The town of  Letcher will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Sanborn County, Letcher was named after O.T. Letcher, who was Assistant Secretary of Dakota Territory at the time. Since its beginning in 1883, Letcher has been a strong reflection of South Dakota's values and traditions. As they celebrate this milestone anniversary, I am confident that Letcher will continue to thrive and succeed for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Letcher on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
