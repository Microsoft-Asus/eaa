  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you know, there aren't many good things happening in federally funded family planning clinics nationwide, but should the largest abortion provider in America also be the largest recipient of Federal family planning funding under title X? I think not. This summer, 189 Republicans and Democrats agreed, supporting my amendment to prohibit tax dollars from funding Planned Parenthood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, in that vein, today I'm introducing the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, a bill that would prohibit the distribution of title X family planning money to abortion providers here at home. There's simply no reason in the world why the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life Americans should be used to underwrite abortion providers in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me as original cosponsors this week in support of the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act.</paragraph>
