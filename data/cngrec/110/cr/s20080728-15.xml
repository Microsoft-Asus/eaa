    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commend Mr. Vincent P. Farri on his promotion to Lieutenant with the United States Capitol Police. Mr. Farri, a native of Maryland, joined the Capitol Police on January 31, 1989. After initial training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center he worked with the Capitol Division Building Patrol, and performed general duties until 1993. In 1993, Mr. Farri was assigned to the uniform protective detail for the President pro tempore of the Senate. I came to  know Mr. Farri during this time and observed that on a daily basis he executed his duties in a highly professional, diligent and courteous manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1998, Mr. Farri served as a senior patrol officer in the Capitol Building, and occasionally worked as an acting sergeant, making rounds and supporting officers at their posts. While performing in this capacity, Vincent Farri distinguished himself on July 24, 1998. On that fateful day, an armed assailant entered the Capitol and suddenly took the lives of two Capitol Policemen. Officer Farri, hearing shots from the floor above, immediately ran to the scene where he came upon the fallen officers,  and assisted in apprehending the gunman. All those who work in and visit the Capitol owe deep gratitude to the police men and women who serve and protect us, and we are especially grateful for the service rendered by Vincent and the sacrifice of his fellow officers on that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September, 1998, Mr. Farri was promoted to the rank of Sergeant and worked with the First Responder Unit of the Capitol Division for approximately 10 years. His collateral duties  included training junior officers and serving with the Capitol Police Alert Team. In connection with his promotion to Lieutenant, Mr. Farri has been assigned to the Capitol Police Command Center. In this position, he provides guidance to officers in the field and serves as  a liaison between the offices of the Chief of the Capitol Police and the Sergeants at Arms of the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1946, during a lecture at the University of Chicago, Senator J. William Fulbright stated, "The legislator is an indispensable guardian of our freedom." I believe all Senators will agree that the U.S. Capitol Police are indispensable guardians of all who serve in and work for the United States Congress. Mr. Farri's 19 years of service have been an important part of that protection. I sincerely congratulate Lieutenant Vincent Farri on his promotion and assignment, and further extend my congratulations  and warm wishes to Christina, his wife of 15 years, his two sons, Richard, age 11, and Paul, age 7, as well as to all of Vincent's family, including his dear mother, Mrs. Dorothy Farri.</paragraph>
