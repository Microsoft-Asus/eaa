  <narrative>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2209]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, continuing on with the remarks that were just made, many U.S. companies are making plans of where they will spend their research and development budgets for the next 3 to 5 years. Unfortunately, this Congress has made it increasingly difficult for these companies to invest those R&amp;D dollars with the kind of careful planning their needs demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>High-tech companies are sending their R&amp;D jobs abroad to countries that recognize that permanent R&amp;D  tax incentives induce businesses to locate research activities there. Canada provides a 20 percent flat credit for R&amp;D. Ireland offers a 20 percent credit, as well as a full deduction, a low corporate tax rate, advanced infrastructure and a skilled, English-speaking workforce, all factors that appeal to many multi-national companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, these jobs sent overseas are permanently lost when a company starts a new R&amp;D project. We must keep these jobs here. The R&amp;D credit has already lapsed. The clock is ticking. Congress must extend the R&amp;D tax credit today, and we must also foster R&amp;D at home by making this important tax credit permanent.</paragraph>
