  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President has asked for another 190 billion more dollars for the war in Iraq. That's 190 billion more dollars for more of the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 41 days for the cost of the war, 10 million American children would get their health care. For 1 month for the cost of the war, 7 1/2  million American children would get their health care. And for 1 week for the cost of this war, 2 1/2  million would get their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President is asking for an open-ended, open-wallet commitment to Iraq, and the American children get an empty stocking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, under the President's own plan, 1 million American children would lose their health care, according to the experts. Nearly 1 million children would create a very long line in America's emergency rooms. The emergency rooms are President Bush's answer to America's health care crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventy-two percent of Americans support our reauthorization of the children's health care bill. The President and 15 Republicans stand in the way of 10 million children receiving the health care that we receive here as Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been three vetoes in President Bush's term: one to end the war, one to permit stem cell research, and now one to allow 10 million children to get their health care. That says it all about President Bush.</paragraph>
