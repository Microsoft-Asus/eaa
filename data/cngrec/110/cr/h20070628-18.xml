    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there once was an incompetent pharmacist who administered too much medicine and thereby made a bad situation worse, and the patient died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats are like the incompetent pharmacist. They recognize that gas prices are too high and they recognize it's bad for us to be dependent on foreign oil. So the Democrats have voted to administer a dose of their favorite medicine, tax increases. They plan to increase taxes on American oil and gas. But the oil companies will simply raise the price of gasoline. In addition, by making American oil more expensive, it will further make us dependent on Middle Eastern oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats should look at drilling for American oil and liquefying coal, two things that they have opposed in the past. The Democrats are writing the wrong prescription and they make a bad situation worse. I just hope the patient doesn't die.</paragraph>
