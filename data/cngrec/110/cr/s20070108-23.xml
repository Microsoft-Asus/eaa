    <paragraph>Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will begin the hard work of moving our country forward with <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>. <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> is the ethics, lobbying, earmark reform legislation that will be before this body tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a long time, it seems, the new Senate has been sworn in. Our 10 new colleagues are here. Today we govern, and we start with <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>. It is called the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act. When passed, this legislation will help ensure America has a government as good and as honest as the people whom it serves. I want the record to be spread with my appreciation for Senator McConnell cosponsoring this legislation. As the Chair knows and has worked so hard to promote bipartisanship,  we cannot accomplish anything in this 110th Congress unless the legislative body works together on a bipartisan basis and sends legislation to the President that he will sign. Senator McConnell set the right tone in agreeing to cosponsor this most important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the weeks leading to this new Congress, we have heard Members from both sides of the aisle talk about bipartisanship. <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> will have turned that talk into action. This is a bipartisan bill cosponsored by the two leaders, as well as the chairs and ranking members of the relevant committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designation of the bill as <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> has symbolic importance. Often <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> is a vehicle for the majority party to make a partisan statement to its base. I have asked my staff to ascertain the last time a bill designated as <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> was jointly sponsored by the majority and minority leaders. It has been 32 years. In 1975, majority leader Mike Mansfield and minority leader Hugh Scott jointly sponsored a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. I am very happy to revive the Mansfield-Scott tradition, where  we have leaders working together to move this country forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many reasons ethics reform is the first legislative item the Senate will consider. Most importantly, because no issue facing this body is more fundamentally important. Honest government should not be a partisan goal. It is the key to a strong nation. All our work this year is based upon what <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> is to the American people. When we make leaders accountable to the people, not the special interests or lobbyists, there is no limit to what we can accomplish. We can be energy independent.  We can have affordable health care. We can build a strong economy and provide real security for our country. Each of these goals can be accomplished if we ensure that the people's needs, not special interest needs, are put first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethics reform is also the first order of business because it is a clear priority of the American people. In election day exit polls on November 7, voters spoke loudly and very clearly about their diminished faith in government. Forty-one percent of voters named corruption as extremely important in determining whom they would vote for. Americans want us to purge the Government of undue influence, and they want us to eliminate the conditions that led to the scandal-making headlines of last year  and 2005: headlines about officials being flown to Scotland for rounds of golf; headlines about committee chairmen negotiating lucrative lobbying jobs with the industries they oversee, while working on legislation important to those industries; and, of course, headlines about "pay to play" schemes such as the infamous K Street Project, where jobs and campaign donations were traded for legislation and other official acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of elected officials and lobbyists have been put in jail for their activities that showed a disrespect for the Congress and the country. The American people simply have had enough. This is not the first time the Senate has considered ethics legislation. Last year, in the wake of the scandals of 2005, we debated and passed a reform bill in the Senate. Unfortunately, it fell victim to politics and never emerged from a conference committee, even though that bill passed on a bipartisan basis  in the Senate. This year we are not going to let that happen. We will pass this bill, put it into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives has already acted on part of this issue, as their rules allow them to proceed faster than the Senate, and that is an understatement. I applaud Speaker Pelosi for making ethics reform a House priority. We will address many of the same issues here. But because of our rules, we will proceed at a much slower pace, not because we want to but that is how the Senate operates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will not be referred to the committees of jurisdiction. Senator McConnell and I have decided to begin the debate with the same bill that passed this Chamber 90 to 8 last year. It has been through the committees previously, providing us with a strong starting point for action this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reforms in <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> are very real, very strong. To begin, it prohibits gifts and travel paid for by lobbyists, such as Jack Abramoff's infamous trips around the world. Under provisions of this bill, no Member or staff would be able to receive any gift or take any trip paid for by a registered lobbyist. Next, this legislation will slow the revolving door that shuffles lawmakers and top staff between Federal jobs and the private sector. We all remember the case of the House chairman to manage the  Medicare Part D bill on the floor of the House only to leave shortly thereafter to make $1 million a year as president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. This bill will ban former Members from lobbying for 2 years, toughen lobbying bans already in place for senior staff, require public disclosure by Members negotiating private sector employment, and strip former Members who become lobbyists of their floor privileges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this bill will improve Senate procedures to make our work more transparent to the public. It will require full disclosure of earmarks. It will provide new tools to ensure that Members of Congress and members of the public have a chance to review bills before they are voted on. It will make it harder to insert new provisions in conference reports and hand out special favors in the dead of night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, it will improve lobbying disclosures. Today lobbyists must file reports semiannually. Our legislation will require them quarterly. Not only that, we will post the reports on the Internet, and we will require lobbyists to include their campaign contributions and fundraisers. Those who don't follow the rules will be subject to stiff new penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, this bill will make partisan efforts to influence private sector hiring, such as the K Street Project, a violation of Senate rules and mandate ethics training for all Members and staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I have outlined, in a broad sense, is a starting point. If we did nothing else other than pass this bill, we would have enacted the most sweeping ethics reforms in a generation or more. But we will not stop with this bill that has been introduced. Very soon I expect to offer a substitute amendment that will strengthen this legislation even more. I hope to do that sometime tomorrow. Then we will have ample time for other Senators to improve the bill through further amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our two Democratic managers, Senators Feinstein and Lieberman, will oversee a strong bipartisan debate. And together we will pass the strongest Government reform bill to come out of the Senate since Watergate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the improvements I expect to be approved this week include extending the gifts and travel ban to companies and groups that hire lobbyists, not just the lobbyists themselves. I also expect we will approve earmark disclosure and that we will toughen penalties for those who set up fraudulent, corrupt lobbying schemes such as the ones Mr. Abramoff created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have tremendous challenges facing us this year, but our first is to restore the people's faith in their government. With the bipartisan reforms I have outlined today, we can accomplish that task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no better way to start this new Congress than by showing the American people that we will answer only to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe we are in morning business; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>What is the length of time for each Senator?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> A 10-minute time limit.</chair>

    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
