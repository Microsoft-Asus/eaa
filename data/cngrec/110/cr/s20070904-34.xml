    <paragraph>Mr. President, I speak today to congratulate the Bridgeport Public School System, which for the second year in a row has been selected as a finalist for the Broad Prize for Urban Education. The $1 million Broad Prize, the largest education prize given to school districts, is awarded each year to honor urban school districts that demonstrate the greatest overall performance and improvement in student achievement while reducing achievement gaps for poor and minority students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That Bridgeport has been nominated for this award 2 years in a row speaks volumes about the progress Bridgeport has made educating its students. The city's schools serve the highest percentage of low-income students in Connecticut, with 95 percent of its students eligible for either free or reduced-price school lunches. Yet in 2006, Bridgeport students outperformed their peers in demographically similar districts in the State in reading and math at all grade levels. In fact, Bridgeport is the  only one of those school districts to improve in reading and math at all grade levels from 2003 to 2006. This improvement was seen across all subgroups of students, including low-income, African-American and Hispanic students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city has also done a remarkable job in closing the achievement gap between White and minority students. Bridgeport has reduced achievement gaps between Hispanic students and their White peers in high school reading and math, as well as in elementary school reading, and the district has reduced achievement gaps for African-American students in high school math. In addition, Bridgeport has closed the Hispanic achievement gap faster than the State average in elementary and high school reading  and high school math. This is no small feat, considering that almost 90 percent of the district's students are racial minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Broad Foundation has praised the district's willingness to take a hard look at the data it collects on student performance, and using it to identify where it is succeeding and where it needs to improve. In fact, Bridgeport uses this data to put together quarterly assessments that are tightly aligned to State standards. Data from these assessments is available in real time, allowing for immediate diagnostics and subsequent adjustments. Given the proliferation of data, administrators and teachers  have become more comfortable using it and district administrators have reported that school principals have been using the data to determine their schools' needs and plans. Teachers have also reported that they too analyze the data when meeting together in teams to determine their strengths and weaknesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This results-based approach, where the main focus is on student performance, has so far been a rousing success. I would like to congratulate Superintendent John J. Ramos, Sr., and all the teachers, principals, administrators, and other school personnel of the Bridgeport public schools not just for the nomination, but for all the hard work they have done to provide a better education to their students. They have proven that it is possible to give all children a fair opportunity to receive a high-quality  education. May other districts follow their example.</paragraph>
