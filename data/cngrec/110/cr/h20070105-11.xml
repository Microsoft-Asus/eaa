  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Good morning, Mr. Speaker, and buenos dias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, folks, this is the people's House, but for much of the last 6 years, House Republican leaders chose to run it with an iron hand--one where only the voices of the special interests were heard in this House. Opposing voices were always ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Democrats vowed to restore democracy in this House and today we live up to that promise by committing to a fair and democratic process and the end of the 2-day workweek. Our proposal specifically prohibits holding votes open for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome. We all remember the Medicare prescription drug vote. I  do. I remember staying here in the wee morning hours, 3 hours, when that vote was held open in 2003 so Republican leaders could  twist enough arms to win their vote. That is not how democracy is supposed to work, and our rules change would prevent that from ever happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also going to give Members more time to read bills so that they actually know what they are reading. It should be par for the course to get a bill of a thousand pages and then begin to vote on it. We need to have more time to review that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, democracy returns to the House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
