  <narrative>THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO UNIVERSITY-ROSWELL -- (Senate - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11652">S11652</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell for reaching its gold anniversary of 50 years. When the branch was established 50 years ago, founders probably only dreamed it would still be thriving well into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ENMU-R started out as Roswell Community College, only offering night classes 50 years ago. Through the last half century, they have continued to grow and expand into an established branch of Eastern New Mexico University. Most recently, they have opened an expansive housing complex with dormitory rooms as well as apartments for students. The university branch is adding program offerings every year. To date, they offer 70 different certificate and associate degrees. ENMU-R continues to be a great  place to learn and experience the college life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To celebrate the anniversary, the university has planned several events throughout the fall. Events include free concerts, parades, festivals, and even a golf tournament, with the kick off event being a hot air balloon rally held in late August.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with ENMU-R in celebrating this momentous milestone. I look forward to at least 50 more years of providing quality education to thousands of students.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to encourage my colleagues to join Senator Isakson and me in support of the 2007 Senior League World Series Champions, the Senior League team of Cartersville, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 18, 2007, the Senior League team from Cartersville, GA, defeated the defending World Series champions of Falcon, Venezuela, by a score of 9 to 0 after Chris Huth pitched a complete game one-hitter. This victory concluded their impressive season with a record of 30 wins and only 2 losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize the 14 young men of the Cartersville Senior League team individually for their great accomplishment: Garison Boston, Ben Bridges, Trey Dickson, Brad Green, Taylor Greene, Tyler Higgins, Chris Huth, Tyler Linn, Levi Mauldin, Colton Montgomery, Cole Payne, Zack Philliber, Hank Stewart, and Tyler Williams. Their manager Eric Stewart and coaches Jeff Payne and Mark Montgomery each deserve strong recognition for guiding these young players to victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the teachers and students of these young men's schools, the fans who represented their community, and the State of Georgia for their enthusiasm and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Cartersville Senior League team and their families. I am extremely proud of each of them and their accomplishments. I wish them great success in the future and urge my colleagues to join Senator Isakson and me in congratulating them on this great accomplishment.</paragraph>
