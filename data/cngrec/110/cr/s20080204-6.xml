  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation. Senators Whitehouse, Cardin, and Feingold have said they will come and offer three amendments this afternoon. After finishing these, we will have about eight more amendments offered. They will all have time agreements, except Senator Feinstein's, but that is not a problem at all. They can probably work out the language on that, and it probably  won't have to be debated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason we cannot finish this most important legislation tomorrow. We should vote on those three amendments tonight. I hope we can do that. There will be other things that can be debated tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, I would like to come in and have three of the most controversial amendments offered in the morning. One deals with the Dodd-Feingold amendment to strike retroactive immunity from the legislation--that part of the Intelligence Committee legislation; the amendment offered by Senator Cardin, who changed the--one amendment is to take away retroactive immunity. The other is to deal with  the substitution, which is a Specter-Whitehouse amendment.  Finally, there is one by Senator Feinstein, which deals with exclusivity of having the FISA Court, the one that handles the intelligence eavesdropping we do in this country. I would like to do those in the morning. We can do that. There will be 2 hours per amendment. We can finish those and have votes in the afternoon. The rest of the amendments are limited to several minutes on each side. Some can probably be worked out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to finish this legislation very quickly, and we need to finish the conference as soon as we can. That is what I would like to do tonight and tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had a conversation with the Republican leader, and we are going to give him my proposed amendment--that is, the Finance Committee package. Basically, the only thing that would be added to that is legislation dealing with LIHEAP, which has wide-ranging support on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also would take from the House bill some of the language they have, which would add to what we have in the bill. So we hope to get to that.</paragraph>
