    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to move to next week. We have business we need to conduct. We have had a very busy day. We have been at an event with the Secretary of Treasury and Chairman of the Fed and a number of others. Next week should be very interesting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an agreement where we are going to finish the extenders now. We have a decision to be made on what we are going to do on the stimulus package but certainly, with what has gone  on in our country the last several weeks, we need a stimulus package more than ever. So we will see what we can get done on that next week and fund the Government until, hopefully, next year.</paragraph>
