  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join many of our colleagues in honoring one of our colleagues who celebrated a very special birthday last week; Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts turned 75. He was congratulated and applauded and heralded throughout these last few days on that milestone. I have come to the floor to give a few brief remarks in honor of this tremendous achievement because it has been 75 years well lived, in dedication to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been an inspiration to me and to many of us in the Senate. His energy, his commitment to his work, his constant thinking about new approaches and innovation is a testament to his presence and his service in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to acknowledge that, at first, coming to the Senate I felt very close to the Senator. Mr. President, you would appreciate this because you are from a large Catholic family yourself. Senator Kennedy was raised some years before I was but in a similar kind of situation, in a large and loving Catholic family, with strong parents and a real focus on community service and service to the family. That is apparent in his work. His Catholic upbringing and his deep religious beliefs  are reflected in the teachings of the Catholic Church, about thinking not of yourself but of others, of service, of sacrifice. Many people talk about religious values, and I am getting somewhat skeptical the more I hear people talk. I am never skeptical of Senator Kennedy because he actually lives the values he preaches. Sometimes some of the greatest things I see him do are not evident to the camera. I would like to share one of them. I could give plenty of examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people might be surprised to know that not only is Senator Kennedy a champion of education, but he actually, for over 2 years, took time out of what is an extraordinarily busy and hectic Senate schedule to tutor a child, teaching him how to read. How would I know this? Because, on occasion, I had the great honor of sitting next to him in the library down the street, where I was trying to keep up with him and thinking if Senator Kennedy can carve an hour out of his schedule,  certainly I could try to do that as a freshman Senator. Needless to say, I could never keep up with the schedule. But I watched him and observed him one-on-one with a child no more than 10 years old, patiently teaching him how to read. The next year it was a little girl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One particular day, he even had the foresight or kindness to bring his pet bunny from home. He has many pets--Splash the dog, being one, and Sonny. He brought his pet rabbit to the school, to the joy of the children perhaps to encourage them to read about animals, which is a good way to get kids interested in reading, to actually show them. He knew this instinctively. Maybe that is because of the family he is from or because of the kind of guy he is. He is an extraordinary and a very different  kind of Senator. I have been inspired by him, and I am confident our colleagues have been as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to acknowledge the tremendous partner he has in Victoria Reggie Kennedy, a daughter of Louisiana. I have watched this couple grow in love and support of one another. I think they are a model for couples who are in public office. We could not find a better couple, in terms of their commitment to each other, to this body, to the Nation, and to the State of Massachusetts and, when they have extra time, to Louisiana. That was brought home when we experienced the last two hurricanes, Katrina  and Rita. As you know, they struck our State in the latter part of the year 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These storms were of historic proportion. It was hard to describe the damage--which I still struggle with trying to describe to this body. But there was one Senator to whom I did not have to take too long to describe the damage, and that was Senator Kennedy, who got it immediately, perhaps because he has walked through south Louisiana with Vicki Reggie, his wife; perhaps he just has a big heart and great mind that can grasp situations fairly quickly; and perhaps because he leans forward  always in his ability and his desire to help people in need. He didn't need the situation to be explained to him. He understood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did he help us pass one of the most extraordinary pieces of legislation in that whole confusing time of the first 6 months when we didn't know what levees had broken, where they had broken, whose they were, whose  fault it was, and everyone was blaming everyone, but Senator Kennedy focused on getting 330,000 children into school, and he focused on getting them into the best school, any school, that would take them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He passed legislation I think will serve this country significantly and powerfully in the decades to come. If any major catastrophe, whether manmade or natural, hits our country again, at least the families with children from K through 12 and the children who are in those grades will know they have a champion in Senator Kennedy, who was not in the majority, but with Senator Enzi as chairman of the Education Committee and with a group of us who were committed to being their helpers,  we passed an extraordinary piece of legislation that, with 1 million people having been evacuated from their homes, 250,000 homes destroyed, hundreds of schools, hospitals closed, literally within a few weeks, children were, for the most part, safely ensconced. Even those who found themselves in shelters for weeks and months at times were allowed and encouraged and welcomed into schools because of legislation that Senator Kennedy passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to showing up on this floor day after day fighting for that legislation and fighting against the extremes who wanted to turn it into a political football and vouchers, he held steady to allow children to go to public schools or Catholic schools--to allow children from Catholic schools to go to public schools and children from public schools to Catholic schools, which seems simple, but at the time it wasn't--he personally delivered to our office some nourishment and encouragement to  my staff who were overworked and under tremendous stress and didn't call me to let me know he was coming, didn't call the news media to make sure they saw him bringing these things, but just showed up. To me and to my staff, that meant the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank him for his great service to this country on his 75th birthday. I will submit a lot more for the public record because his legislative achievements are quite long. Since they are well known, I thought I would add some points people might not know about this extraordinary public servant and Senator who turned 75. I only wish medicine would keep up with us so that he could serve another 75. That is unlikely, but I am sure in the final years, in the final chapters of his life, he will continue  extraordinary service and will probably go down in history as one of the finest Senators to ever serve in this body.</paragraph>
