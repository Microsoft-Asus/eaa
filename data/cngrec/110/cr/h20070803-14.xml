    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today there is going to be lots of talks about process and procedures and walkouts and delays. The American people don't want us to focus on process. They don't want us to walk out. They want us to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way we can move forward on both sides of the aisle is to pass an energy bill today as a matter of national security. Because 2 years ago the Department of Defense spent $10.6 billion to fuel itself to protect us. The Air Force spent $4.7 billion on one thing: Fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a situation right now where we are borrowing money from China to fund defense budgets to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the time to delay or walk out. This is the time for us to work together, move America forward, pass an energy bill and make us safer.</paragraph>
