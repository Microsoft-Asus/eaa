PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The purposes of this subtitle are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to create an FHA program, which is voluntary on the part of borrowers and existing mortgage loan holders, including both existing senior mortgage loan holders and existing subordinate mortgage loan holders, to insure refinance loans for substantial numbers of borrowers at risk of foreclosure, at levels which are reasonably likely to be sustainable through enhanced affordability of debt service;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to provide flexible underwriting for FHA-insured loans under such a program to provide refinancing opportunities under fiscally responsible terms, including higher fees commensurate with higher risk levels, a seasoning requirement for higher debt to income loans, and additional program controls to limit and control risk;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to bar speculators and second home owners from participation in such program;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) to require existing mortgage loan holders to take substantial loan writedowns in exchange for having the Federal Government and the borrower assume the ongoing risk of the refinanced loan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) to set a loan-to-value limit on such loans that provides the FHA with an equity buffer against potential loan losses, provides protections against the risk of future home price declines, and creates incentives for borrowers to maintain payments on the loan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) to protect the FHA against losses which may exceed normal FHA loss levels by establishing higher fee levels, including an exit fee and profit sharing during the first five years of the loan, with such higher fee levels effectively being funded through the required lender writedown;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) to provide a fair level of incentives for junior lien holders to provide the necessary releases of their lien interests, in order to meet program requirements that all outstanding liens must be extinguished, and thereby permit the refinancing to be completed;</chair>
  <chair> (8) to enhance the administrative capacity of the FHA to carry out its expanded role  under the program through establishment of an Oversight Board which adds expertise from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury, through additional funding to contract out for the provision of any needed expertise in designing program requirements and oversight, and through additional funding to increase FHA personnel resources as needed to handle the  increased loan volume resulting from the program;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) to sunset the program when it is no longer needed; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) to study the need for and efficacy of an auction or bulk refinancing mechanism to facilitate more expeditious refinancing of larger volumes of existing mortgages that are at risk for foreclosure into FHA-insured mortgages.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 112.

  <chair>SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This subtitle may be cited as the "Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) one of the primary missions of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance program is to reach borrowers who are underserved, or not served, by the existing conventional mortgage marketplace;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the FHA program has a long history of innovation, which includes pioneering the 30-year self-amortizing mortgage and a safe-to-seniors reverse mortgage product, both of which were once thought too risky to private lenders;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the FHA single family mortgage insurance program traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage insurance for home purchases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the FHA mortgage insurance premium structure, as well as FHA's product offerings, should be revised to reflect FHA's enhanced ability to determine risk at the loan level and to allow FHA to better respond to changes in the mortgage market;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) during past recessions, including the oil-patch downturns in the mid-1980s, FHA remained a viable credit enhancer and was therefore instrumental in preventing a more catastrophic collapse in housing markets and a greater loss of homeowner equity; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) as housing price appreciation slows and interest rates rise, many homeowners and prospective homebuyers will need the less-expensive, safer financing alternative that FHA mortgage insurance provides.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to provide flexibility to FHA to allow for the insurance of housing loans for low- and moderate-income homebuyers during all economic cycles in the mortgage market;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to modernize the FHA single family mortgage insurance program by making it more reflective of enhancements to loan-level risk assessments and changes to the mortgage market; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to adjust the loan limits for the single family mortgage insurance program to reflect rising house prices and the increased costs associated with new construction.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 203.

  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Mr. Frank. In the 30 years that I've known him, I've yet to meet anybody who has done a better job of mastering the most arcane detail of complicated housing policy. In fact, in some measure, we're here today because of the energy that he's brought to the task at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in support of this housing assistance tax package which has been reported by the Ways and Means Committee. I want to thank Chairman Rangel for his leadership on this very important national issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is little doubt that the sagging housing industry, now at historic lows, has been a drag on our national economy. This legislation would stimulate that industry and help families who have been caught up in this struggling economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides tax credits for first-time homebuyers, and it boosts credits for construction of affordable housing. It allows families to deduct property taxes who couldn't do so before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It increases mortgage revenue bonds and it allows the States to refinance troubled subprime loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This assistance is targeted to those who need it most. It will also help bring economic stability to our communities. And these provisions are revenue neutral, I emphasize "revenue neutral," using a provision from the President's own budget to pay for much of the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill has been endorsed by the Home Builders, the Realtors and State Housing Administrators. It passed with the support of 12 Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee, including my friend and the distinguished ranking member, Mr. McCrery. It is broadly supported, it's bipartisan in nature, and I am proud to bring it to this House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are but two changes to our amendment. One is a package of technical improvements from the Financial Services Committee to better coordinate the various housing tax and HUD programs. The other is--and I hope that everybody will listen to this suggestion--a provision approved by the Veterans Affairs Committee to extend from 90 days to 1 year the protection against foreclosure for servicemembers returning from active duty. I can't imagine that there is a voice in this body who would not be  supportive of that initiative, the idea that in Afghanistan and/or in Iraq, that a servicemember who is doing all that's asked of him or her every day would find themselves facing mortgage foreclosure because of their military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee, again I stand in strong support of the legislation that's before us today. It includes a number of improvements to the affordable housing program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our subcommittee considered these provisions last summer. And at the urging of housing officials, developers, and advocates for low-income families, they have all been included in the Ways and Means amendment that we consider today. I urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I rise to urge my colleagues to vote against the tax amendment to this bill. Let me be clear, however, in stating that my opposition to this section is not the result of a disagreement with my friend, Mr. Neal, or with the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rangel. We were able to work together so that the housing bill reported by the Ways and Means Committee enjoyed bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while that package contains many provisions that do make sense, I think the House should have had the opportunity to consider at least one alternative. Unfortunately, the procedural straitjacket imposed by the majority for consideration of the housing bill today is something that I simply cannot ignore. For that reason, I will be voting against this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all understand the severity of the housing crisis. Housing starts declined to 680,000 in March of 2008, the lowest level since January of 1991. Since hitting a peak in early 2006, housing starts have dropped by 62 percent. There is currently a 9 1/2  month supply of unsold homes, more than double the 10-year average. With those facts in mind, it is not surprising that home prices are falling, and the contraction in the residential real estate market is an anchor around our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Tax Code didn't get us into this mess, and there is only so much the Tax Code can do to get us out. The package approved by the Committee on Ways and Means contains many well-designed improvements, including improvements to make the low-income housing tax credit more efficient. I also think allowing those credits to be claimed against both the regular tax and the AMT is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language expanding the Mortgage Revenue Bond program and allowing proceeds of the bonds to be used to refinance existing home mortgages, as suggested by the President, is certainly worth doing. And although I have some reservations about the design of the first-time homebuyer's tax credit, the recapture provision, if we include it, makes it more like a no-interest loan and not really a tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, I share the hope of the sponsors that this provision will help induce some home purchases this year and stabilize the market. We desire that because we recognize that potential homebuyers right now are reading the headlines every day, they're waiting on the sidelines to get to the bottom of the market. Well, as prices keep falling, more people who might think about buying a home decide to keep waiting, and so that creates a self-perpetuating cycle of declining home prices. Maybe, just  maybe, this tax credit could induce some of those waiting on the sidelines to go ahead, jump in and buy a home. That's our desire. I think it could have been better, as I say, designed as a pure tax credit with no recapture provision, but still, I think it's better than nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the concern raised by some that an artificial temporary floor, so to speak, will not restore long-term stability to the housing market and could even result in further price declines when the temporary benefit lapses. But on balance, I think this provision holds some hope of helping us to reverse this slide in housing prices, or at least stop it for a while and give it a chance to recover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, there are elements of this package that, frankly, I would prefer not be in here. Given the nature of the housing crisis, I think the House should follow the Senate's lead and waive PAYGO, for example. I think this is an emergency. We shouldn't be responding to this emergency situation with tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there are specific items in here that if it were up to me might not have made the cut. But democracy is about compromise, and the bill produced by the Ways and Means Committee was something that I supported and would like to vote for again here on the House floor today. But the decision made by the majority leadership to debate this legislation as an amendment to a Senate-passed bill deprives the House of the chance to consider ways to improve it, even to the extent of denying the minority  a motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I recognize that tax bills traditionally come to the floor under restrictive rules, and I support that. But as I documented in a letter last year to the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee, in years when Republicans were in the majority, on one tax bill after another the Republican majority offered the Democratic minority not only a motion to recommit, but a substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to insert the text of that letter to the chairwoman of the Rules Committee into the Congressional Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>While the usual practice has been to provide for the consideration of an amendment in the nature of a substitute, I recognize that there have been instances where such consideration was not allowed under the rule. In many of these cases, the amendment was either non-germane to the underlying bill, was not an actual substitute amendment, or was not compliant with the Budget Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have submitted an amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="2776">H. R. 2776</bill>. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the amendment complies with Clause 10 of House Rule 21, otherwise known as the "paygo rule." In addition, through consultations with the Office of the Parliamentarian, I am assured that the amendment is germane to <bill type="h" number="2776">H.R. 2776</bill>. To my knowledge, it would violate no rules of the House.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At the same time, I recognize that it is not uncommon to resolve differences between the House and the Senate by sending amendments back and forth across the Capitol. That's what's being done today. But what makes today's procedure so unusual, and to some of us so frustrating, is that this House never had a chance to work its will on housing legislation. This is not a housing bill that went to the Senate, was amended, and then sent back to us. This was an energy bill for heaven's sake. It was  gutted in the Senate, replaced with housing provisions, sent back to us, and that is what has created this unusual opportunity for the  majority to deny the minority even a motion to recommit, and it's wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Mr. Speaker, I think that action reflects poorly on this House. It's a trampling of the rights of all of our Members, not just the minority. And I, therefore, plan to vote against all of these amendments and urge my colleagues to do the same until we can get a fair hearing, a fair rule governing the debate of these very important matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent at this time to allow the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, to control the remainder of time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do offer some acknowledgement of the constraints that we find ourselves within today on the House floor, and I think there's some accuracy as to what Mr. McCrery had to say. However, there is another very important point, and that is, that the issues were vetted at the committee level and there was ample opportunity and a full and vigorous debate ensued in the Ways and Means Committee in which every opinion was welcomed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise in strong support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been some bipartisanship that has motored this legislation, and I hope it won't break down today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crisis in housing needs the attention and the support of everybody. It needs much more than tea and sympathy, it needs legislation. Recently I met with mayors and managers from the 12th District, in Macomb County and southeast Oakland. And they all talked about the plight of the homeowner, the plight of the communities when houses are shut down. We have to act. And I pay tribute, all of us should, to the Committee on Financial Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me say just a word about the tax provisions. They would provide credit to first-time homebuyers. Essential. It would improve access to low-income housing. Essential. It would allow families to deduct property taxes through the standard deduction. It's a good experiment. It should have been done earlier. And it also would allow Federal home loan banks to help relieve pressure on credit markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I read the Statement of Administrative Policy that said it was risky and it was an expansion of the purpose of the banks, and I think it's incorrect in both respects. So I just want to close with the sense of urgency that I think all of us feel. Mr. Bernanke said that if markets were simply allowed to follow their own course, it could "destabilize communities, reduce the property values of nearby homes and lower municipal tax revenues."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What more do we need to impel us to act than the flight of families, the plight of communities, and the plight of municipalities? Let's vote on a bipartisan bill. Let's vote for this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm troubled by the housing catch-all bill before the House of Representatives today from a commonsense, pro-American taxpayer position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would enable the already troubled FHA to take on an additional $300 million in distressed mortgage liabilities, loans that have a good chance of going into default. This effectively transfers risk from those holding bad loans to those taxpayers who made prudent decisions in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than nine out of 10 mortgage holders make payments on time. They would now be on the hook for the bad mortgage debt, as will renters saving for a first-time home and those who own their own homes outright. This bill sends the signal that there are no real consequences for poor lending or borrowing practices, and encourages more of the same behavior that led us here in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, to offset some of the tax giveaways in the bill, the Democrat majority proposes billions of dollars in what amounts to a retroactive tax increase on American employers with operations in foreign markets. What our economy really needs is tax policies that foster greater, not less, competitiveness for the U.S. employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is truly disappointing that the Democrat majority has chosen to bring this bill up in a lock down, unamendable manner. I urge my colleagues to reject this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would remind the audience, including the Members that are on the floor, that this procedure was fully vetted in the Ways and Means Committee. It passed 35-5. That means we picked up 12 members of the minority who supported this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to yield 2 minutes to my friend, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you can't have it both ways. You can't say that this is an emergency and we've got to get something done, and then in the other breath say let's go through the technical procedures. They're contradictory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was vetted. And housing inventories in our communities continue to increase and home prices continue to decline. We need to incentivize Americans to reenter the housing market. It affects so much of our economy. I think this amendment, this bill takes giant leaps towards accomplishing this goal. I applaud Mr. Rangel for his efforts and the 12 Members from the distinguished opposition who joined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an array of good work here, but in particular I'm heartened that included within is a tax benefit for most first-time homebuyers. This is a truly meaningful incentive, and one that will pull out a large swath of people from the sidelines and back into the market, having a ripple effect throughout the rest of the economy. After all, without bold action to spur housing market activity, inventories across the country may continue to grow, placing downward pressure on home prices and wiping  out equity that so many Americans have worked so hard to build.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We don't want more homes to be in that situation. We prove nothing. There is a place for the Federal Government, therefore, in this terrible situation that has occurred and developed over the last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, when passed, will allow middle class families to receive a tax benefit that is equivalent to an interest-free loan of $7,000 towards the purchase of their first home. It will also allow existing homeowners who claim the standard deduction to an additional standard deduction for property taxes, up to $700 for a married couple filing jointly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Schwartz) for 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for acting so swiftly and wisely to stem the tide of foreclosures and address the sagging home values that are hurting families and communities across our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By addressing a whole range of issues, from the continuing foreclosure  crisis to the new and existing homes that are sitting vacant and further depressing the housing market, this package represents a significant step toward stabilizing the economy and restoring consumer confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of the portion of this package that came through the Committee on Ways and Means, particularly a timely, targeted, and well-designed first-time homebuyers credit; a new Federal tax deduction to help families meet rising State property taxes; and expansion of the ability of cities and States to raise capital for infrastructure improvements by partnering with the Federal Home Loan Banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I am pleased that the package includes a provision that I championed, along with my Republican colleague Jon Porter, which would enable State housing finance agencies to raise capital through tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and use these additional funds to help at-risk borrowers refinance their subprime loans, access mortgages at fair rates, and enable families to meet their financial obligations and stay in their homes. This provision will work hand in hand with the  Federal Housing Agency reforms that have come out of Chairman Frank's committee and will allow States to play a role in addressing the needs of their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put it, " ..... doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interest of lenders and borrowers, it is in everyone's interest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in everyone's interest that we overcome this crisis in the housing market, that we work to stabilize the economy, and we work to maintain and build our competitive edge in the global economy. The proposal before us is a comprehensive approach to this challenge, and I hope that it will be supported by all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400338" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the debate continues from the Ways and Means portion of the housing bill, I believe the ranking member has set very clear remarks on where many of us find ourselves with this debate today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery have a superb working relationship, and they have set the tenor of what has been hard work on both sides of the aisle and bipartisan compromise and consensus to craft some good legislation that has passed this body and has become law. And as I manage this portion for the minority and look across to my colleague from Massachusetts, he and I also share in commonsense solutions to strengthen America and to resolve some of the problems  and challenges that are there. And this bill is not an exception to that. We worked at the spirit of request of both the Chair and ranking member to reach compromise and consensus to improve the Ways and Means jurisdiction on housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I look at it with sadness in two parts. One, as a realtor who looks at the industry, knowing across the country that we face challenges, and the statistics that Ranking Member McCrery outlined, 680,000 fewer starts, a reduction in high percentages of what the industry is about, seeing what the drag has been on our country's growth. And we need to work through good, solid solutions that need a hearing process that involve the Congress, particularly this body, in a debate of solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when we look at the entire complexity of this bill, not only as a Ways and Means member, not only as someone who understands the housing world, but also as a former member of the Rules Committee, I know that the Members of this body were trampled on based on the decision of taking an energy bill and making the housing provisions, one of the challenges of the country today, short-circuited as an amendment to circumvent debate, amendments, recommittals, and substitutes that would be afforded  the minority in any other instance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I look at this and the frustration I heard in the ranking member's message of what is being trampled on on rights of the minority to make presentations, quite frankly, maybe some majority Members on amendments, recommittal, and substitute, I find it disturbing that this is the beginning of strong trends of kind of a less than reasonable approach to advance legislation through this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in the final thoughts, as we look at the predicament we're in on procedural processes here and maybe the fact that we could have made this bill even better, I must share with my colleagues that there is a clear veto message on this legislation as it leaves the House and it will unlikely be the solution of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just briefly in reference to my friend Mr. Reynolds' comments, the constraints that we are operating on today, as he criticizes them, are entirely legitimate; but they are institutional problems, as opposed to just the will of the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was asking a Member of the minority last evening, "Is it possible to be an aggrieved Member of the majority?" In these instances I think you can be an aggrieved Member of the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to emphasize a very important point: This legislation received overwhelming support from the minority in the committee, and I think based upon news accounts this morning that there was some conflict in two major dailies as to whether or not the administration would, in fact, veto this legislation, but I can't overstate enough this simple point: There was ample opportunity for the minority to participate in the debate at the Ways and Means Committee; and, in fact, they succeeded in  amending the legislation that has come to the floor today, and every voice was heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that I would like to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. And I would like to particularly thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this amendment and the overall housing package we are considering today will help millions of Americans and significantly improve the economic situation in my State of Nevada. In recent years the vibrant economy and rapid growth in my district of Las Vegas combined to make the city appear immune to economic downturn. This foreclosure crisis has shown that this is no longer the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada has had the highest statewide foreclosure rate for well over a year. The surge in foreclosures has led to huge inventories of unsold homes. This, in turn, has led to massive layoffs of the construction industry and other housing-related fields. Nevada, which has been a land of economic opportunity, the fastest-growing State in the Nation, now has an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent, which is, I'm sorry to say, well above the national average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment takes several steps that will help both current and prospective homeowners as well as increase affordable housing opportunities. Current homeowners will be helped by the creation of a standard deduction for property taxes, which will lower Federal taxes for taxpayers who don't itemize and by freeing up funds to refinance certain subprime loans. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers creates a great incentive to get families into properties that are currently sitting vacant due  to foreclosure or that have been sitting on the market for long periods of time due to excess unsold inventory. The bill also takes steps to increase affordable rental housing, another critical need in Las Vegas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm hopeful that the combined efforts of this amendment and other provisions of the package will be to alleviate the current housing crisis and help turn our Nation's economy around. I proudly support the intent and the substance of this legislation. I urge adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I must say I think it's insulting to the American people when they hear that there are Members on the other side of the aisle that support the bill, support the intent, but are voting against it because they didn't get a procedural motion to vote on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's do what's best for the American people and stop this ridiculous infighting that nobody out there cares about. They care about staying in their homes. They care about protecting their families. And, quite frankly, they don't give a hoot whether somebody has a motion to recommit to vote on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee and a leading expert on this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Reynolds, for your leadership on our economic issues here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a principle that is before us today is that Congress should not be bailing out speculators, lenders, or investors who have behaved irresponsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you bought a home that is too big for you, that you couldn't afford from the get-go, or you were betting that property values would go up in your region, that's tough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you lent money without income or means of those who were borrowing it, or you preyed, you preyed on people who didn't know better and then churned their loan repeatedly, that's tough. If you purchased securities without determining if the loans underlying them were sound, that is your problem. That is not the taxpayers', that is not your next-door neighbor's problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do have a role in Congress and it is this, to address this issue: One, we should make sure that there is available, affordable credit for creditworthy borrowers. We need to make sure that we prevent this from occurring again. And we need to punish, aggressively punish, the bad actors who have infected our entire American economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal we have before us today is well intentioned, clearly. I think Republicans and Democrats agree on the need to help where we can. It is well intentioned. It is not particularly effective. I have my doubts that it will help much at all. It is too little, too slow, too unfocused. It is, as you would imagine, a typical Washington reaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, a provision to allow States to have more authority for low income housing. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, we need more of that. That housing likely, knowing the process that works here, in the State of Texas and others, it will probably be 3 years before anyone moves into housing of that caliber. Way too late for this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The property tax deduction for seniors who don't itemize, you always want to help people with their property taxes. But is a retired person really going to take $350 and buy a new home or buy a foreclosed home in their neighborhood? Not likely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even the tax credit for first-time homebuyers, a part that, I think, the philosophy of which I really like. But this no-interest loan is structured so low, $7,500, it won't allow them to buy a home. There are not many $75,000 homes on the market. If it's only a 5 percent down payment, there are, truthfully, not very many $150,000 homes that are in the areas of America that actually have massive foreclosures. Those tend to be either in the depressed areas or in the high-value States where a lot  of people did bet on rising property values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So I like the philosophy of it. I don't think it will help much. Thankfully it won't hurt. It won't hurt. There are good things in this bill. The FHA modernization and the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac I think are exactly appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if our goal is to make sure we have available credit for creditworthy borrowers, I think this bill is a poor alternative to the Hope Alliance, which is moving faster and more effectively today and covering more than 90 percent of those who have mortgages and could have problems, or has already worked with 1.4 million families who need help moving them into new loans or moderating the loan they have today. And they are doing that without taxpayers underwriting any potential loss. That is,  I think, the approach that works best and is already proven to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will finish with this. I have said that there is nothing patently offensive in the amendment from Ways and Means. In fact, again, I think it is well intentioned. But in the underlying bill by Chairman Frank, there is something that is especially offensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from Texas. Our region was destroyed in Hurricane Rita, a hurricane that was stronger than Hurricane Katrina. We lost 70,000 homes that were damaged or destroyed. We lost more than $1 billion of our timber industry, our main crop. We still have 10 percent of our families who haven't moved back to southeast Texas because they don't have housing. Yet in Chairman Frank's underlying bill, he creates an affordable housing fund and dedicates $500 million to Louisiana and Mississippi  to help rebuild housing in those areas. And yet for the same hurricane, and Hurricane Rita, in the communities that actually took in the Katrina families as they fled that hurricane, and then those same families have their own roofs torn off in southeast Texas, this bill says, "Drop dead. Forget it. We are going to help those who are on this side of the hurricane."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>But to those who not only took in those of Katrina, to those communities that opened their hearts, their churches and their homes and have their own community destroyed, this government and this Congress is saying, "Forget it. We are going to divide this hurricane along State lines. You can drop dead. No help for you in housing. No help for you in apartments. No help for you, period. None. Zero for the victims of Hurricane Rita in Texas."</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. The legislation does two things that are good and one thing that is very good in its absence. The two things that are good are one, it addresses very specifically, in a practical way, the housing crisis that has been brought on by the subprime foreclosure debacle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What it does is it shares the opportunity of relief and it shares the pain of getting the relief so that we can end up at the end of the day with several hundred thousand American families still in their homes, lenders having been able to mitigate their loss, homeowners being able to keep a roof over their head, and the American taxpayer not being left on the hook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does it by recognizing we have to use existing institutions to accomplish that. It does it by acknowledging that it has to be voluntary. A lender will be in this program only when they make the practical business decision that it is a better route than foreclosure. A borrower is going to be able to make that same change and has to be able to demonstrate an ability to pay at the new current appraisal value of that property. And in the process of doing that, it means that we use the guaranty  of the taxpayer, but in all likelihood, according to the CBO score, not the money of the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is a practical solution to a very severe problem that could only have been brought to this House for consideration with the extraordinary cooperation of both sides in the Ways and Means Committee, the Financial Services Committee, and the help of high administration officials who had significant input along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it would be very unfortunate if the procedural debates that we are having about process, made at the leadership level, derail what is a practical approach to solving a very serious problem. What this bill isn't, and I congratulate the Members on both sides as well, it is not a blame game about who caused this. That is for another day.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come down and speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly in every one of our districts, the housing crunch or crisis affects everyday people. And we have to look at the best way to resolve this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think what we have today is kind of a best-intentions type of bill. But I don't think it's really getting to the heart of the matter. When I have talked to several economists that specialize in the real estate markets, all have told me that when you're looking back and trying to remedy or bail out what has occurred, that you are really not going to fix the problems or stimulate the housing industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have developed, with several of my colleagues, a bill that is forward looking. It is straightforward. It is an up to $10,000 tax credit for a purchaser of a home, not a foreclosed home only or a new build only or anything like that. Just if they want to buy a new home or a home they would be eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that there was at least a weak attempt to something like that in the amendment that is before us now. We have got a $7,500 tax credit. But when you look at the eligibility and the fact that, yes, it is a refundable tax credit that you have to pay back, it turns out to be rather useless in trying to stimulate the housing market. This is really a faux or phantom tax credit. So I don't think that can be used to help stimulate our economy or the housing market to get us out of the housing  depression here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And one of the issues that we're talking about here today is the devaluation of our homes because of the housing depression and that what we're going to do is make up the difference of a home that has been devalued that goes into--</paragraph>

    <paragraph>What we are going to do is spend $300 billion to try and get us to right size that by bailing these folks out. That's just going to prolong the problem according to the economists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two points there: If that is all that we are really going to do here, we are not going to turn the tide of the devaluation of our homes. The only way to do that is to increase demand overall, which increasing your tax credit will do, not the phantom one that is here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other way is when you look at the market and the availability of credit, especially for lower income people, I think we are doing the right thing here by increasing the cap or the limit on credits for low-income housing. But there is also market-available tools that are out there. I have had people come to my office and present these market, nongovernment bailout programs, not programs but options, where they use a 501(c)(3) entity where you can put the life insurance in and cover the costs,  reduce the house, and I thank you for the opportunity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I must tell you I swore to myself I was going to resist what I'm about to say until I heard the term "bailout." The minute I heard the term "bailout," I thought to myself the speed with which the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury came to the aid of Bear Stearns in a 48-hour period. And to use that same example of making it an analogy here is striking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400338" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first, I guess I will ask the gentleman if he has any other speakers. I am prepared to close and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I think, again, for our colleagues it is important to understand some of what has happened that the minority feels that their rights have been trampled in what has been a very unusual decision on a major piece of legislation, housing. It is certainly a significant piece of legislation because the Rules Committee granted 3 hours of debate by various jurisdictions. So it certainly sends a signal to all observers that this is serious. It warrants debate. And it is now before  the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to remind my colleagues that this is not a bill that has gone regular order. There is a Senate bill that is energy that has come over to the House. And we have now amended it entirely with a housing amendment. And so this is an amendment to an existing Senate bill to circumvent all of the regular order process that the House enjoys and has had speakers of both parties affirm this should be the action of how we debate great issues of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body is really infamous for acronyms. So today I call this the SSAD Amendment, or the Sorry Sick Amendment Decision. It is sad because the bipartisan work that was done in the Ways and Means Committee outlined by many from the Ways and Means Committee is not being worked through a process so that bipartisanship and the ability to have the entire body debate its work that came from committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is sad that the bipartisan work was trampled in the Rules Committee by this decision to slickly move around the mechanism of regular order in our House. It is sad that there is no substitute. It is sad that there is no recommittal. It is sad that what makes it a procedure so unusual and so frustrating is the House never had a chance to work its will on housing legislation. In fact, as I said, the housing bill sent back to the House by the Senate was an energy bill. When it first passed the  House, it had nothing to do with housing. And it is sad that a procedural straitjacket has been used in order to garner the type of votes that the majority wants to put before the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is just plain sad that the bipartisan work of the Ways and Means Committee is joined up by the Rules Committee with the Frank housing bill, because it has been clear that senior advisers to the White House will recommend the President veto the work of the Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we debate one of the significant issues that many feel should be debated in the House, it is a sad day how we have approached to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me see what I can do to lift the spirits of the gentleman from New York, my friend, Mr. Reynolds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I think what is sad is that you are leaving us, that you're retiring. And I was searching hard to figure out the meaning of that acronym, based upon the fact that the Ways and Means Committee took this legislation up, and I want to reiterate, for the fourth time today, 12 of the 17 Republicans on the committee voted for the very bill that they are now all saying they are going to oppose. Forgive me. That is sad. How can you come to the floor and argue against the proposal that you voted  for in the committee when you agree with just about every part of the bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's what's before us here. We have heard these arguments, and they have all said, we support most of what's in the bill, but they are prepared because of an institutional constraint with the Senate to vote against the legislation that they favor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Massachusetts, it's sixth in the Nation in foreclosure activity. In Springfield, the largest community in my district, 300 homes have been foreclosed this year and over 2,000 mortgages will reset to higher interest rates by the end of next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the worsening housing crisis, Massachusetts this month initiated a new law that extends the foreclosure moratorium from 30 to 90 days. Other States are taking similar action, but, like Massachusetts, they need help from Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reports seem to suggest that the housing slide won't turn around until 2010. These tax provisions we are considering today for families and communities will help turn it around, I hope, much sooner. It certainly will help our economy and markets in general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's housing proposals really haven't worked. It's time for the Congress to act. We are often accused of having a short memory, but I think all Members in this chamber remember the recent government-backed bailout of Bear Stearns, yes, the bailout of that mom-and-pop operation called Bear Stearns. If we can, with great urgency and enthusiasm, come to the aid of Wall Street, we have no excuse not to help the people who reside on Main Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will claim the remaining time on behalf of the Financial Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a composite package. The President some time ago, a couple of weeks ago, urgently asked the Congress to send him several pieces of legislation, three in particular. One is embodied in the part of the bill that came out of the Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, in fact, had previously passed the House from our committee, the bill reforming the government sponsored enterprises--and that came out of our committee and on the floor in a form that the administration mostly liked--and the bill to modernize the FHA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Senate then acted on the bill to modernize the FHA. We went into conference, we ran into some difficulty. Not a formal conference, but a conversation. What we have done because, as we know, the Senate is in a situation where procedurally it's often harder for them to act, so we are acting on the basis of a Senate bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are readopting today two of the pieces we already adopted, reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA modernization. I think it ought to be noted that in both cases they are a recognition by the President that the private sector needs to be able to cooperate with public or quasi-public entities to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who take the philosophy that the market alone is sufficient unto itself, and that public sector intervention will do more harm than good clearly have been repudiated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FHA is a government agency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government creations with both public and private aspects. It is clear that we need both of them if we are to get out of this current crisis in mortgage lending and be able to go forward in a healthy way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one new element today. That is a bill that our committee voted on last week and the week before. We had a markup. It was suggested to us in many ways by some of the regulators. In its essential form it was endorsed last Monday by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and we worked closely with his staff. The administration had an objection to one major piece of an auction mechanism. That's the longer part of the bill. What it says is that holders of loans, not the lenders, because the  lenders have unfortunately long since been able to sell off their loans in many cases--and that's part of the problem--if the holders of loans will write down the amount due them in the principal, and if they get to a point below the current value of the home, in many cases these</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's entirely voluntary on the part of the lender. The lender will retain the right to foreclose. In many cases we believe that it will pay the lender not to foreclose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, we have legislation in this package sponsored by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski) that will ensure servicers who are willing to write down the amounts, that they will not be sued if they write down those amounts to a reasonable level. We think that is very helpful. Again, it's voluntary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do believe that knowing if you write this down to a reasonable level, accepting your loss, you will be able then to at least get some guarantee of that to help stabilize the situation. But people should understand, there is not $1 of taxpayer money going to writing down that loan. The holders of the loans have to write it down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the borrower can then go to the FHA if the borrower can pay the new loan, but there is no taxpayer money that will go to help pay off that loan. The taxpayer exposure comes in the fact that there are FHA guarantees. If someone gets an FHA guarantee and subsequently fails to make the payments, his or her house is forfeited to the FHA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will lose some money on this, we believe. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that half a million foreclosures will be averted by this program, that would otherwise have taken place, at a cost to the taxpayers of $2.4 billion. That means $4,800 for every foreclosure averted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told, well, this is a bailout, and I want to follow on what my colleague from Massachusetts said. We have seen one bailout this year over investors and speculators. It came when the Federal Reserve, actively urged on by the Treasury, bailed out for $30 billion potentially--we don't know what the losses will be--but $30 billion is at risk of what will ultimately be public money, to lenders, to speculators and investors, people who were partners at Bear Stearns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now there may have been some confusion yesterday. I tried to avoid it. I am not critical that we are doing that. I am critical of the lack of sensible regulation that led them to be in that position. I think we do have to examine it, and I want to examine it from the standpoint of what we can do that will make it less likely that we will be confronted with that kind of choice, either provide those funds or see serious further economic debilitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for the administration that engineered $30 billion of bailout for the investors and others who did business with Bear Stearns to say that this $2.4 billion cost according to CBO that will avert 500,000 foreclosures is unacceptable as a bailout is as intellectually and morally and economically inconsistent a policy as we have ever seen. It is true, and some of the Republicans have said in a letter to me in the House, that they wanted to question this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note, by the way, we talked about this, I have looked at the letter that was sent to me. I looked again at the letter, and in no case does it say they were opposed to it. People raised questions. Maybe that's an easy way to kind of cover your bases, but my point is not so much those who wrote the letter, it's the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration says they're going to veto this bill, that it's a bailout. It is $2.4 billion versus $30 billion at Bear Stearns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I believe that Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke have been doing the best they can in this situation. I am not critical of what they have done. Chairman Bernanke has been consistent and thinks this is also a reasonable thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, of course, appointed Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke, and for the administration that supported and facilitated the $30 billion for Bear Stearns which went to lenders, went to investors and some of them were speculators--to then object when it's homeowners seems to me to be entirely the reverse of the reality of the situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to stress, I was asked by 17 Republicans if the committee would have a hearing. My answer was yes, the committee will have a hearing after we have dealt with the current subprime crisis--and that will be soon, that was our priority--and a hearing not simply to say what did you do, because we cannot compel them to undo it--to look at what they did in the Bear Stearns thing in the context of figuring out how we are best able to diminish the likelihood that it will recur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we are in a recession, and a major cause of that recession is the subprime crisis. We do not see any alternatives to this bill to trying to work on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we had Hope Now, and then we had FHA Secure. The administration had several policies. They have been closer, in many ways, to us. The differences are not as great as they once were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fundamental here is this, foreclosures are causing, have caused and are causing serious economic problems. Diminishing the number of foreclosures is in the interest--not simply of those who will avert foreclosure--but of people in the neighborhood of the cities in which they are located and the whole economy. That's why we are going forward with this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this Democratic omnibus housing bill, and also I rise in strong opposition to the procedure under which it comes to the floor today under a contorted rule, which is designed to do one thing and one thing only, and that's allow no Republican amendments, allow no input, allow no open debate of different provisions with any ability to modify those provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record page 24 of a promise that the Democratic majority made to the American  people. It's a statement of the Speaker of the House in their document "A New Direction for America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regular Order for Legislation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups, with appropriate referrals to other committees. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the Minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes, with the customary 2-minute extension to accommodate Members' ability to reach the House Chamber to cast their votes. No vote shall be held open in order to manipulate the outcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House-Senate conference committees should hold regular meetings (at least weekly) of all conference committee Members. All duly-appointed conferees should be informed of the schedule of conference committee activities in a timely manner and given ample opportunity for input and debate as decisions are made toward final bill language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Suspension Calendar should be restricted to non-controversial legislation, with minority-authored legislation scheduled in relation to the party ratio in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this document, the Democratic majority promised to the American people in what was called a Congress working for all America, they made this promise: "Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the Minority a right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that's not what we have here today. Instead, we have what we are calling the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, but, in fact, it started out as a bill here in the House and passed the House as a bill to move the United States towards greater energy independence and security. Absolutely none of that bill remains, it's a total sham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through some, I suppose, back room, front room, side room, smoke-filled room, who knows, but the Democratic leadership, we, the American people really don't know--but at some point they decided to take every bit of that bill out. The only thing that remains of that bill, actually, is the resolution that brings this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It refers to this bill and the resolution that brings it to the floor. The resolution says, upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (<bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>) moving the United States towards greater energy independence and security, developing innovative new technologies, reducing carbon emissions, creating green jobs, increasing clean, renewable energy production. That's all gone. But that's still in the Record. That's still the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the procedure outlined here indeed stifles the democratic process. It corrupts the democratic process. Despite "A New Direction for America," despite a specific promise not to do this, we have a process that not only allows no Republican amendments, no substitutes, it does not allow even a vote on final passage of this entire bill. There will be no vote on final passage. There will be a vote on each of the three amendments that go to make up this package, but as the resolution  clearly says, it is sort of self-executing, a motion that the House concur in the Senate amendment to the title, the so-called renewable energy bill, shall be considered as adopted. There won't even be a vote on that. Now that is pretty innovative. That is pretty unusual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But above all, as strange and as contorted and convoluted as this is, it is a corruption of the democratic process. It is a corruption of our democratic system, and it is a sad day for this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not the Members of this House who are being denied the full amendment process, it is Americans, those Americans we on this side of the aisle represent. They, as are we, are being shut out of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, if we had been allowed, and we were not allowed to offer a substitute, if we had been allowed to offer an amendment, one of our first substitutes would have contained some of the things that the Democratic alternative has. It is a Democrat alternative, but there is no alternative, nor was one allowed, so I am not sure that we ought to use the word "alternative." Alternative without an alternative is maybe what we should call it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it has FHA reform in it. When we said we would have liked to have offered a stand-alone amendment or offered legislation to do that, the chairman says that has already passed the House. Certainly it has; so did the renewable energy bill. But it didn't pass the Senate. We would like, because there is agreement in this House, and we could have agreed today and almost unanimously passed a FHA reform bill which all Members of this body say will go a long ways toward solving the problems of Americans  stressed by lowering housing prices and their mortgage obligations. We could have done that. But in the Senate there has been no movement. We won't do that today because if we start taking those concrete steps, it will diminish the majority's opportunity to take what is a bad situation and adopt and create a tremendously expensive new omnibus housing bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GSE reform, we would have liked to have seen that joined with FHA. It is in this bill, and it is offered kind of as a candy or a carrot: take the GSE reform which you want, take the FHA reform which you want and we have all passed, and in doing that, you will have to take a new $300 billion housing program. At a time when we are running a deficit, that makes no sense to most Americans, most of us on this side of the aisle. Most of all what I do oppose is our inability to strike from the overall  package this new $300 billion government subsidy that I believe is fundamentally unfair and likely to do more harm than good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me explain, and in doing so I do not want to minimize the seriousness of the distress many of our citizens are experiencing. When we talk about distress, we sometimes focus on those who are behind on their mortgage payments. But, Mr. Speaker, let me assure you there are millions of other Americans who are making their mortgage payments; but, nonetheless, they are under an equal stress or a great stress themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night the gentleman from Vermont said what we want to do with this bill is we want to spread the pain from those million or 2 million Americans who are behind on their mortgage, we want to spread that pain to all Americans. We want to spread that pain to those 34 million Americans who are renting their homes. We want them to take part of that yoke upon them. We want those who are making their mortgage payments on time, we want them to adopt some of this liability and assume some of this  liability. We want those 25 million American families who have paid off their mortgages, many of them elderly citizens, we want them to assume some of this pain. We want them as taxpayers to assume some of these liabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, 110 million American families who are making their mortgage payments on time, who are renting or who have paid off their mortgages, they are being drug into this process and are being made liable and are on the hook now for these bad loans. They have been reading about it, and now they are going to be responsible for them. Now they are going to have to start paying. And the vast majority of Americans who find themselves struggling with mortgage payments, struggling with high gas  prices, struggling with high food prices, are now going to assume responsibility for ill-advised financial decisions and misjudgments of other people. Good and decent people who have absolutely done nothing wrong, don't have a bad mortgage, don't have a problem with their mortgage, are going to be trapped in this dragnet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is it necessary to involve the 110 million American families that aren't behind on their mortgages? I say, no. No. In fact, the Federal Government has already extended almost a trillion dollars in guarantees of liquidity. They have brought onto their books, the Federal Reserve, almost a half a trillion dollars worth of these questionable loans and questionable securities backing these loans. And the American people could be on a hook for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my companion on the Financial Services Committee and 17 of  us on the Republican side wrote the chairman and said we need to take a close look. We need to urgently look at the Federal Government extending its guarantees and assuming securities and investments that maybe have no market value, just to pump liquidity into the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now what we have agreed to in the past and we continue to agree with and we would have liked to have said let's go further with this, is the Hope Now program. The 1.4 million Americans, those who come closest to making their mortgage payments, they are behind or in default but they were close, and they had an ability to, with adjustments to their mortgage agreements, could make those payments, 1.4 million American families have been helped by Hope Now. And we think that more will be helped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FHA Secure program, almost 180,000 families have been helped by that program, at some Federal expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before we create a massive new government program and put billions of additional taxpayer dollars at risk, we need to think long and hard about asking other Americans to assume this burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lenders and securitizers wanted no part of government regulation or interference when house prices were soaring, and they made extraordinary profits. Speculators made millions of dollars. Lenders made millions of dollars. Investors on Wall Street bought high-risk SIVs, securitized investment vehicles, and they made millions of dollars. Sometimes we read where the heads of those hedge funds, private equity funds, and investment banks were paid a billion dollars in profits. They all made a lot  of money. But now that the loans that they eagerly made are going bad, this bill offers a mechanism to off-load their problem loans onto the American taxpayers. That is unfair. It is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because participation in the plan is voluntary, no investor will part with a mortgage if they think it has a reasonable chance of performing. The incentives are designed to ensure that the taxpayer loses. Investors will place the worst mortgages they have into the program. In fact, that is exactly what they are going to do. They are going to off-load the worst of their loans. If there is any chance of people paying, they won't put these loans into this pool. They will take those loans where people  are way behind or have no ability to pay and they will put them into a program that will be financed by FHA-guaranteed loans. We all know when those loans go bad, who pays. It is not the lenders, it is not the borrowers, it is not the investors, it is not the speculators, it is the people we all represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the substantial risk these loans present, no lender would refinance them without the FHA guarantee. That is what was said on the floor. They are not going to refinance these with a Federal Government guarantee. There is a reason for that. They anticipate a default.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result is the taxpayers of this country, 110 million American families that acted responsibly during the run-up in housing prices will be left to bear the cost of cleaning up after irresponsible lenders, investors and speculators. That's just not fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I oppose this housing package and I express my disappointment that the Republican Party, the minority, that many representatives here were shut out of the process, denied any opportunity to address the bill's many deficiencies through the amendment process or through the motion to recommit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida for 3 minutes, I would like to note the use of the figure $300 billion is not a hopeful sign about a rational debate. Three hundred billion is the total value of the mortgages that could be insured. It would cost $300 billion only if nobody made any payments ever, and when the property was taken by the Federal Government, none of it had any value. CBO gave us a score of $2.4 billion. So we can debate this,  but I would hope we can debate it with real numbers. The CBO score for the mortgage part is $2.4 billion. Everybody knows that $300 billion is not remotely what is at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield now 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for clarifying the true potential cost of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we have to face the fact that many Americans are in a very tough financial position. If I have learned anything over the past year, it is how intricate our financial and economic markets are woven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As members of the Financial Services Committee, we have been presented and have debated dozens of proposals and ideas to combat this housing crisis before us. Many of them were sound, good ideas worth pursuing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the months leading up to today, going around my district I came to several conclusions, but one is that Congress cannot accept the status quo. I have been patient. I believe in the market working itself out, but that just doesn't seem to be happening. At a time when our dollar is devalued, not only is the price of petroleum products, the gas everyone fills up with over $1.70 more than it was a year ago, we also have very high food prices. People are finding it hard to make those payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the beauty of this, it has to be a homeowner who is being helped out, not a speculator, not a flipper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Chairman Frank's proposal isn't perfect, I do think it is one that Members should take a very close look at and compare it to what is happening in their districts. It is a voluntary, participatory program. No one is forced to play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is not the silver bullet, by any means. Homeowners, lenders and investors will make sacrifices under this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I'm also concerned about hearing from constituents who try to work with their lenders, but their lenders won't call them back. I'm tired of driving through the Fifth Congressional District and seeing many houses vacant because of foreclosure. No one wins when a house in the neighborhood is foreclosed, absolutely no one, because it brings down the value of those properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, Mr. Chairman, we cannot stick with the status quo. That's sticking our policy-making heads in the sand. By providing lenders an incentive to write down mortgages, modernizing FHA, improving GSE oversight and including tax incentives, I believe we can help Americans get back into the market and help the housing market to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill isn't perfect, and certainly, neither was the process that this bill comes to the floor. And I'm sure that Chairman Frank agrees that the process is murky, at best. But I do believe that what we have before us will provide relief to Americans, and I urge Members to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>You know, Congress has yet to submit a single bill to the President that might begin to address this crisis in the housing market, and here we are again debating controversial new housing legislation, instead of passing common-sense housing reform that could start helping homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I feel like I woke up one morning, we just had a markup on the Housing bill, and suddenly, I couldn't even find the number of it, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, and it suddenly was a different bill with a lot of different provisions in it. Some were the same and some weren't. I have to say this reminds me of the SCHIP bill that we debated, which kind of came over here the same way from the Senate. I don't think it's going to be the same result, but I just can't understand that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I do appreciate Chairman Frank's inclusion of FHA and GSE reform, as well as the funding for housing  counseling and mortgage fraud in the bill that we're considering today. But these are much needed reforms that could increase the liquidity in the housing market and provide consumers with an alternative to the bad subprime loans, and help to restore consumer confidence, which is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But attaching these things to a taxpayer-funded bailout will not get them any closer to the President's desk. And make no mistake. This is a bailout. It would place U.S. taxpayers on the hook for the $300 billion guarantee, but that includes the riskiest mortgage debt on the market. And it does this by allowing speculators, borrowers who have overstated assets, who have cheated and knew that they couldn't make the payments, and those who invested irresponsibly, to pawn off their financial liabilities  on U.S. taxpayers. This is a liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And instead of serving distressed homeowners, the bill requires that the lenders, not the homeowners, to make the decision to place the mortgage in the program. Since the lenders are the ones that would like to get rid of their bad loans and put those on the, be guaranteed by the Federal Government, the taxpayers, the taxpayers will be bailing out the banks, the investors on their most unwise lending decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more disturbing is that the bailout is partially funded on the backs of seniors through changes to FHA reverse mortgage program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't be asking American taxpayers to pay for the mistakes of those who over estimated their income on mortgage applications, or scam artists that inflated appraisals and flipped properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nor should they pay for homeowners who chose to live beyond their means, using inflated home equity loans to buy a new plasma TV, a swimming pool or a fancy car. It is not fair to those who saved and invested responsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of Americans are working hard to make ends meet. Ninety-three percent of our mortgage holders are making their payments on time. Fifty-one out of 55 million Americans with a mortgage are making their mortgage payments on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-five million Americans own their own homes and have no mortgage. Thirty-four million Americans are prudently renting because they aren't ready to own a home. These hardworking Americans should not be forced to foot the bill for the bad decisions of a few who gambled that their home values would never stop rising. They don't think that's fair, and I don't think so either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that many of my colleagues are looking at the economic effects of the housing bubble and saying to themselves, "We must act, we must do something. "But we shouldn't do something if it's not right. Congress can help struggling borrowers and promote economic growth without burdening the taxpayers with inappropriate spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's why I join with Financial Services Ranking Member Bachus to offer an alternative plan that helps homeowners in a responsible way. It does include the FHA reform. This could solve this problem right away. Our substitute funds housing for counseling, other reforms to GSEs that's so important, without a so-called trust fund or slush fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there's nothing in the Democrat alternative that would prevent a similar housing crisis like this in the future. Though improved, disclosure lender registration higher price is standard.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="TITLE VII--REVENUE AND OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Our Republican alternative would do more than put an expensive Band-Aid on the housing market. It begins to address the underlying causes of the subprime mess. It will ensure that borrowers have access to legitimate loans; that they understand the terms of their loan, and that they are taking a loan that they can afford based on the actual value of the house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to bring transparency and integrity to the homebuying process, and we need to expand access to credit for worthy borrowers who genuinely want to pay off their loans, but we need to do it without wasting taxpayers' dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have an alternative bill that would solve these problems. And many were supported by both Republicans and Democrats. It's a commonsense plan that doesn't spend money and, in fact, has been scored by CBO to actually reduce the deficit by $25 million. Coupled with Mr. Terry's tax credit for owner-occupied homebuyers, it will jump-start the flailing housing market and get our economy back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I urge my colleagues to vote against the bill before us today and consider the alternative, if we had the opportunity to have an alternative.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself first 45 seconds to say that on the scoring, $2.4 billion was the CBO score for the mortgage part. They did say a total of $2.7 billion. The other $300 million is attributable to an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois on mortgage. So the gentlewoman from Illinois is correct. It is $2.7 billion. That includes the $300 million she added to the bill with her amendment, and the $2.4 million in mortgages.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment that I have offered with Mr. Miller of North Carolina be modified and amended, and I will describe that--but then I know the Clerk has to report it--just by adding 2 words, on line 7, after the word "foreclosure" adding the word "process," and on the next line, after the words "foreclosed property," add the word "maintenance."</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I appreciate my colleague on the committee for attempting to clarify an issue which is, I think, significantly problematic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of defining foreclosure time, and length, the particulars have always been the purview of the States. And I know that this amendment is an attempt to try to clarify that. In fact, I think it confounds it, and my concern about the unanimous consent request is that it doesn't make it clear still. So I have significant concerns about the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm happy to yield to my friend from Ohio for any clarification that he might offer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield to me on his reservation, I would make this observation to the gentleman and to the House. This amendment that Mr. Miller and I crafted, obviously, one of the things that vexes, and it doesn't matter whether it's financial services or anything else, one of the things that continues to vex and cause tension between the Federal Government and the States is this whole issue of preemption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when Mr. Miller came to me with the original amendment, we began to hear some concerns. And quite frankly, the concerns were are you opening the door to a Maryland-type situation, where they can pass a State law that says that nobody can foreclose on property for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. And clearly, although I happen to think that that kind of abrogation of property rights is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority, I understood the concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I will tell the gentleman on his reservation that we sought the advice of the OCC and the OTS and received a list of things that are already preempted. And as I think the gentleman has accurately stated, the manner, the process in which foreclosures have happened have always been the purview of the States. And then the boarding up of properties or the maintenance of properties that are foreclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so it is my attempt through this unanimous consent request, I think, from all Members, and I think Members on both sides of the aisle have some concerns about this. This wasn't limited to Republican Members. There were some Democratic members that had concerns as well. The OCC has indicated to us that this answers that concern. It doesn't deprive them of their authority under the National Bank Act. Some of the banking institutions that were originally concerned about the amendment have indicated  the that this is language that they can live with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just as a Republican Member of the House, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia, under his reservation, that this is typically the point in our debates where our distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee skewers us as Republicans for being for States' rights on some days and being against States' rights on other days. It was my goal to make sure that States' rights were preserved on those things that they've always had the opportunity to regulate, and not impinge upon  those, but also recognizing that not all the best ideas in terms of how to proceed on process or maintenance necessarily emanate from this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding on his reservation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I appreciate those comments and I would agree. I think that all of us, many of us in the House, many certainly on this side of the aisle, want to retain the States' prerogative in the area of foreclosure. And I would suggest to the gentleman that his comment about that, and the discussion that's gone on on the unanimous consent request and the language therein, is something that "they can live with."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this probably should have been dealt with in committee, and it might have been able to be clarified to a much greater degree. My concern remains.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I regret that, but sometimes people would rather see things not improved so they can then complain that they weren't improved. Fortunately in this case, we are not constrained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Ohio said it had not come to our attention fully until after the committee markup. What happened was that they came forward with this amendment, and we heard some concerns from the Comptroller of the Currency, as the gentleman from Ohio has said, and from bankers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We then talked to the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller), talked to the American Bankers Association, the Community Bankers Association, the Mortgage Bankers, the OCC, various of the advocacy groups, the State Attorneys General, the National Council of State Legislators, and they came to an agreement that adding these words would make this something that would work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the obvious thing in a constructive way would have been with the agreement of all of the stakeholders and the conversations among Members on both sides to be incorporated into the bill. But constructive isn't always the order of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me make this announcement which I have also, in anticipation that there might be such an objection, although I had spoken to the ranking member and he told me he thought we should go forward. It was my understanding the gentleman from Ohio had talked to the leadership on the Republican side. They thought it should go forward. So here is where we are. We will vote on the Miller-LaTourette amendment. I will guarantee to the Members that when this goes forward in any discussions we have with  the Senate, we will accept this language, the Miller-LaTourette language, or if someone comes up with a better idea, any other language that would be mutually agreed upon by the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from North Carolina, the two bipartisan sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while we don't get the unanimous consent agreement, because some people would rather there not be a resolution over an objection, let me announce what may be a first, and I'm not always the most technologically updated person; I don't have a lot of the devices, but I do want to maybe be the pioneer of the virtual unanimous consent agreement. In good faith the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Ohio want to amend this, they were denied unanimous consent, but I am prepared  to act as if the body, and I have no question that it would have been adopted had we had a chance to vote on it, that it be incorporated. And as we go forward, we can guarantee Members that this language, if this bill is included, this will be included; and I can report that all of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish we had got unanimous consent, but I want to assure Members that in this process going forward, our failure to get real unanimous consent, as opposed to virtual unanimous consent, will make no difference whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this point, let me yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina to complete this conversation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to add my assurance to that of Mr. Frank, as if anyone would need that, but I think that this clarification really does not change the intent of the statute. On its face, going from foreclosure to foreclosure process is redundant. Foreclosure is a process. It is a legal procedure. It is a legal procedure by which real property given as security for the payment of a debt is seized and sold to pay the debt. It is a legal procedure. It is  all process. So saying "foreclosure process" appears, on its face, to be redundant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the concern has been that States would add to the same section of their State ordinances, their State statutes, other provisions that have nothing to do with foreclosure procedures, that have to do something to make other provisions; and yet there would be the argument that all of those now are exempt, immune from any argument of preemption. That is certainly not what we intend, and I lend my assurance to that of Mr. Frank that I will work to make sure that the language that  Mr. LaTourette just presented be the language in the final bill.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400131" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, and I would say that people in my district, there are some people who are hurting right about now as there are around the country. There are some people, indeed, who are homeowners in very bad shape. Some, for example, were duped or lied to by people that loaned them money. Some, a few, have lost their jobs. Some bought homes at the high of the housing market, say $150,000, now to find that their house is more like $120,000 or $100,000. And  we all feel very sympathetic for those people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I don't feel too terribly bad for speculators that went in search of ways to get higher returns and take higher risks as an exchange, and that's who is getting bailed out today. I also don't have complete sympathy when it comes to using taxpayer money to reimburse people that, for example, put zero money down. They didn't buy that home. They bought an option to buy the home. People that bought into a 3-percent teaser rate knowing that if the interest rate went to 7 percent, they would never  be able to stay in that home. People that used no documentation to demonstrate that they ever had the chance to repay. They moved into a home with an option to continue buying it. They didn't make the type of commitment that most homeowners do  to put 10 or 20 or 30 percent down and to make sure that they have a mortgage and a loan that they can pay under virtually any circumstance except for a disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who does this bill help? Well, The Wall Street Journal made it very clear who this bill helps. This bill is a bailout from American taxpayers of speculators and imprudent borrowers. Less than 1 percent of borrowers whose homes, under this bill, would be eligible when all is said and done to be helped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come today to speak on behalf of the forgotten man. And that includes some 50 percent of Americans that either own their home or are renting. Every one of them watching today needs to know that they are bailing out irresponsible speculators and lenders and they will pay the price of this bill. I come here to speak for the 90-plus, 95 percent of homeowners that are making their payments on time, that took out responsible loans. They need to know that they are bailing out irresponsible speculators  and people that went in search of higher profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investors who take advantage of this program are basically getting a guaranteed gift from the government: 85 percent of a loan that they know is not likely to perform. We are bailing out people that will cherry-pick the very worst loans in their portfolio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who is here speaking on behalf of the forgotten man? Who is here speaking on behalf of 99 percent of Americans that did not behave irresponsibly, that did not behave foolishly, that ultimately will pay the price for this bill? Well, some of us in the minority are here speaking on behalf of the forgotten man, which is 99 percent of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would leave you with this: Chairman Frank and the CBO and others can estimate how much this bill will cost these forgotten men and women, 99 percent of Americans who were not irresponsible who will pay the price. The answer is we don't know. We don't have a crystal ball. If property prices around the country take off by another 50 percent and go up, there will be no cost. If they go down by 30 percent, the cost will be closer to $3 billion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Foreclosure Prevention Act on which would address today's crisis in the housing market and help many American families work out their financing to avoid foreclosure, although it comes a little bit too late for the gentleman I talked to in Green Bay an hour ago who will be losing his home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we are all aware, foreclosure rates have risen, Housing prices are declining, and too many families nationwide, including many veterans who served us with bravery, honor, and courage in Iraq and Afghanistan are overwhelmed with their monthly mortgage payments, many having fallen into the trap, the adjustable-rate mortgage trap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I commend Chairman Frank for graciously including a provision I offered that would provide funding in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 for grants to be administered to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for mortgage foreclosure and credit counseling for veterans recently returning from active duty. The mounting mortgage delinquencies and defaults pose a serious economic threat to our economy, to say nothing of what it does to affected families and their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preventing foreclosures for our veterans will benefit all communities, and more importantly, by providing additional counseling, resources to veterans, it will enhance their ability to make sound financial decisions during these challenging times. Our soldiers need our help now, and toward that end, I'm pleased that the Foreclosure Prevention Act would also assist returning soldiers to avoid foreclosure by lengthening the time a lender must wait before starting the foreclosure process from 3  months to 1 year following a soldier's return from military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act is not a handout. It is a hand up. And I urge my colleagues to support passage of this very important legislation.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first come here somewhat amused at the lecture that some of us received from the majority leader last evening on abuse of process. I hear many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we have a housing crisis and that this is one of the single most important bills to come to this floor in this Congress. And yet here we are, as the minority, not being allowed any amendments, not being allowed a substitute, not being allowed a motion to recommit, not even being allowed to have  an up-or-down vote on the bill. And we're accused of an abusive process?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But enough of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at the substance of this. There is a great challenge in our housing markets. There is no doubt about it. And there are innocent people who have suffered, and they deserve to be helped. But this is the wrong plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we need to do, Mr. Speaker, is, number one, we have to have better disclosure so that people understand the economic obligations they're undertaking. We need to enforce the laws that we have on the books. Mortgage fraud has been rampant on both the borrowers' side and on the lenders' side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to prevent the automatic tax increase that has been included in the majority's budget that's going to impose a $3,000-a-year on the average American family tax increase phased in over the next 3 years. We need to do something about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline and food that has occurred on the watch of the majority. They've been in charge of the economic policies of this country for almost 18 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The shrinking American paycheck is our challenge. A huge bailout of Wall Street and borrowers, some who may be innocent victims and some who may be guilty, is not the answer, and using taxpayers' money to do it is simply an insult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, we ought to have the facts before we actually take on a major piece of legislation. The American people need to know. Over half of America rents their homes or owns their home outright. Of those who have an active mortgage, 95 percent are making their mortgage payments on time. You have roughly 2 percent who are in foreclosure. So now we're being asked essentially for 98 percent of America to bail out 2 percent of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now listen. On the investors' side, these are a big bunch of boys and girls on Wall Street who made decisions about what they should invest in. We know from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that mortgage fraud has been rampant: 1,400 percent increase over the last 6 years; 42 percent increase last year alone, with the majority of the fraud being borrowers who lied about their income, about their assets, about their occupancy; and yet we have a bill to help them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's hear from some of the people who are being called upon to do the bailout. I often ask people who reside in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas that I have the honor of representing what they think about legislation coming to the House floor. And I hear from people like the Sadler family in Mesquite, Texas, and they write:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Congressman, 3 years ago my husband and I faced the loss of our home due to a decrease in the sales income. We cut our expenses as much as possible, but it was simply no longer affordable. We made the decision to put the home on the market before we faced foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I am adamantly opposed to my tax dollars going toward bailing anyone out of a mortgage crisis. If we didn't have to give up so much of our income to the government for taxes, we could have continued to afford our home."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what is the answer of the Democrat majority? Well, to the Sadler family in Mesquite, we're going to increase your taxes an extra $3,000 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I heard from Sergeant First Class Kenneth Adams of Frankston, Texas. He writes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Congressman, the mortgage crisis Congress is trying to fix is an insult. My house went unpainted until I could return from serving in Iraq. I'm a Sergeant First Class in the United States  Army with over 20 years active and reserve service. Some day I would like to use my VA house-buying benefits, but what a fool I was to earn those type of benefits when all I had to do was be irresponsible, overspend, and have the government bail me out."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's the answer that the Democrat majority brings to the floor, and it is an insult to 98 percent of Americans who did it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we should reject this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO MODIFY AMENDMENT NO. 3">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2007, Texas ranked fourth behind California, Florida and Illinois in pre-foreclosures. We're reminded of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said we have nothing to fear but fear itself. We certainly have to face fear and to be able to respond to this collapse in mortgages and our economic markets, by resolve and not fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so this is not a bailout. It's a helping hand. It's what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did to restore this country, and it worked. We survived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so this tells us that we can survive, providing $10 billion in low-income tax credits for low-income homeowners and to also build rental properties. We also give a $7,500 tax credit for first time home buyers and a $700 tax credit for those who are paying property taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it does fix the GSEs. It does provide an opportunity to get us out of this mortgage foreclosure hold, but it does it in the right way. It's not scandalous. It's not illegal. It allows us to be able to have the mortgage owner sell it back to FHA at a lower price; the lower mortgage is then backed by FHA, and it isn't a gimmick. It's not a flipover. Any profit made by the homeowner comes back to the government if the property is later sold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we protect our disabled veterans, those who have fallen upon hard times. They can still be in the program even if they are in bankruptcy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill responds to the homeless and the helpless. What it does say is those who are living from hand-to-hand, who are living in their parents' homes, who have been thrown out of their home, who have been thrown out because they're in rental property, this is a fix and the life and the spirit of what America is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't believe in giving a fish. We believe in giving a fishing rod. This is an even-handed, balanced way between the House and the Senate to provide tax relief but also to be able to provide the construct and the infrastructure to get our houses back together, along with our stabilization bill that says we're going to buy back foreclosed homes and give them to people who need them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is there anything wrong with America rising to be higher angels and helping our fellow brothers and sisters?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the "American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008". This momentous legislation would jump-start the market for mortgages by establishing a true market value for the securities backed by these loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> responds directly to the current housing crisis facing this country, while providing the tools to prevent a repeat of these problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt stated in 1933, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance." We must do just that. We must move forward and  that is exactly what <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> seeks to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will begin to repair, not bail out the economy, restoring confidence in the markets, limiting the damage to families and neighborhoods, and rejuvenating the communities with new affordable housing. Ironically, we celebrate the bailouts of yesteryear, when we believed that the power of the federal government was needed to get the country out of the Depression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Were the banking reform laws, emergency relief programs, work relief programs, and agricultural programs, the Social Security Act, and programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant workers--were these bailouts? Many of the New Deal programs under President Roosevelt were considered bailouts at that time. And yet, these programs brought our country out of the Depression, rejuvenated our economy, and gave hope as we sought to deal with the War overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, Texas ranked fourth behind California, Florida, and Illinois in pre-foreclosures. Last year, Texas held the top seat for active foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> helps homeowners and only homeowners, not speculators or lenders. We cannot continue to stand by as things get worse. Texas reported 13,829 properties entering some stage of foreclosure in April, a 16% increase from the previous month and the most foreclosure filings reported by any state. The state documented the Nation's third highest state combined foreclosure rate--one foreclosure filing for every 582 households.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many homeowners in my district are worried about missing their next house payment or their next home equity mortgage, or their interest rate going up. These families are under stress and in constant fear of losing their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill should not be the last word in housing legislation, it is a great beginning. This bill coupled with <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act, provides a good starting point in providing Americans with relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), announced the Texas State Program and the cities of Houston and New Braunfels will receive a total of $234,868,077 to support community development and produce more affordable housing. HUD's annual funding will also provide down-payment assistance to first-time home buyers; assist individuals and families who might otherwise be living on the streets; and offer real housing solutions for individuals with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While HUD is working to help Americans, we must all do our part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to pass <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, and we need to continue to push in a bipartisan manner, legislation that will ease gas and energy costs, the rising costs of food, and the ever-rising cost of health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are spending billions of dollars on the war in Iraq. I support our troops but I am dismayed at how our support for a war that needs to become less military and more diplomatic in nature, has disrupted our ability to take care of things at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Thank you Mr. Speaker for your leadership in this area, I urge my colleagues to support American families by supporting, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>. I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to a champion of the working family, Mr. Garrett from New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to voice my opposition to the underlying bill, as well as the underlying unfairness that's contained in it. But before I speak about Title I, which does contain the opportunity to use taxpayers' dollars to insure up to $300 billion worth of new mortgages to bail out the Nation's banking industry and homeowners, those who made irresponsible decisions, I want to briefly discuss other parts of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman has been routinely criticizing the administration for failing to do anything, he says, to address the current housing problems facing the Nation, but you know, this administration has been calling for the last couple of years for FHA reform and new regulations for the GSEs. However, the new Democrat majority in the House and the Senate has been unable to pass these important measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, when you think about it, who knows how many people we could have already helped to stay in their homes and keep out of foreclosure if the Democrat leadership would have only forged an agreement already and passed those previous bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate that due to the refusal of the distinguished chairman and others in the majority to temporarily forego some of their pet projects, such as the housing slush fund for ACORN and La Raza and others, that these two important reforms have been held up now for the last year-and-a-half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now, with this new housing omnibus bill before us, the chairman has once again refused to compromise, I say, in good faith with the administration or the minority side and has included such pet projects once again.  And as an indication of the majority's unwillingness to substantively compromise, the administration has issued a veto threat to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 6 months, the administration and HUD have been working on a program, the FHA Secure. It's to try to help American families who are in the right house but maybe not in the right mortgage to stay in the house. And this program has recently been expanded upon and has to date helped thousands of Americans to be able to stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now our distinguished chairman and Democrat leadership are proposing a plan that is really financially risky. It rewards irresponsible behavior and it mandates a loosing of FHA underwriting standards, and this is important, that would put taxpayers on the hook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, when the chairman put together what I say is an ill-conceived plan, he noted originally that it would help up to 2 million homeowners. Well, unfortunately when CBO scored the bill, they determined it would only help 500,000, and that's the same amount they have oft criticized the administration plan is projected to help. So you'll excuse me if I find it a little hypocritical here that those who believe that the administration's plan isn't going to provide adequate help to struggling homeowners  but that this new plan, which is forecasted to help the exact same number of people, is somehow the perfect cure-all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the bill before us for consideration goes much further than this. This bill actually pays people to stay in their houses. It would give every homeowner who was in trouble and participates in this program a 10 percent equity stake in their home. Normally, depending on the specifics of your loan, it could take you or I 3 or 4 years for a homeowner to make enough payments for you to get a 10 percent equity stake. Now under this bill, we're just going to give those people who are having trouble  making their payments. You know, I know things are bad in the mortgage markets right now, but are things so bad that we actually have to pay people to stay in the houses?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where is the fairness in that proposal? The distinguished chairman acknowledged during the committee consideration that maybe this bill isn't fair in that sense. What about the person who has been patiently sitting on the sidelines over the last several years, saving up, waiting for these unsustainable high housing prices to come down to reality, come down to earth? They've been paying their rent every month, building up no equity whatsoever. What about those people? We're now rewarding someone  else who has undertaken an irresponsible loan and bought something, frankly, they just couldn't afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about the person who took out a loan 3 years ago and he's been scraping by, struggling just to get enough money from every paycheck to paycheck to afford their mortgage and, I say, attain their 10 percent equity over 3 years? Now, again, with this bill, we're just giving that equity away to people who didn't save, didn't decide they would live within their means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say the reason this provision is needed is that it will encourage people to stay in the houses. I believe, quite frankly, the possibility of being kicked out of your house is incentive enough to try to stay in your house. I don't have a problem with trying to help people, and this side of the aisle is trying to do it as well, to stay in their homes, but I do have a problem with facilitating arrangements in which they are given a 10 percent equity in their home with a mortgage that is insured  by the Federal Government, and that means the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our distinguished chairman was quoted in the paper the other day, "We have done as much as possible to respond responsibly with the public policy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the legislation before us completely disregards borrowers' payment histories and credit scores when considering eligibility for this program. Borrowers could have missed the majority of their monthly payments over the life of the loan, yet these borrowers would still be eligible for a government-backed mortgage--and taxpayers would be on the hook. An amendment was offered during the committee process to rectify this and it was soundly defeated by the Democrat majority party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also heard a number of members on the other side of the aisle mention today their concerns about the Federal Reserve bailing out Bear Stearns to the tune of $29 billion. However, none of the members complaining or any democrats for that matter choose to sign onto any of three letters I and a number of my Republican colleagues sent to Chairman Frank, Secretary Paulson, and Chairman Bernanke noting our strong concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 17 months that the Democrat majority has been in charge, the Administration has been asking for a number of housing reforms from Congress, none of which have been delivered. Now, they want to say the Administration has idly sat by and watched as the housing turmoil has continued to increase, while it is actually the Democrat congress that has yet to pass significant housing reforms that could have provided the Administration with the much needed tools to begin easing us out of this  housing downturn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chairman states that this a grand compromise between the different groups involved in the discussion, but the only compromise I can see is the one between he and his party, the big banks who made unsound loans, and the special interests and trial lawyers that stand to benefit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first I wondered how I'd fill 2 hours, but I could do that just responding to the inaccuracies we've just heard. Let me pick a couple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from New Jersey said that the administration wanted FHA reform and GSE reform and this Congress wouldn't get it. Well, he misread the newspaper. Bryan Montgomery, the head of the FHA, was quoted yesterday as saying, if Congress had done what I wanted in 2006, this wouldn't have happened. It was the Republicans who were in power in 2006. It was under the Republicans that GSE reform and FHA reform were frustrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we took power as the Democratic majority, last year this Financial Services Committee and this House passed both of those in forms very close to what the administration wanted. In fact, the holdup on the GSE, and I know the gentleman thinks the notion of building affordable rental housing with public help is, as he calls it, a slush fund, and I think it's that lack of sympathy for affordable housing that was one of the contributing factors to getting people into homes they couldn't have  owned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact is that we sent the GSE bill over to the Senate last year with a very large majority in favor, and the Senate hasn't acted, partly because the ranking Republican on the Senate committee hasn't wanted to act. I know the administration has been trying to persuade him to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the notion that the affordable housing trust fund, that's slush fund for the gentleman from New Jersey, housing for lower income people, for elderly people, for disabled people, that's slush fund, well, it was not that that held it up. It was the refusal apparently of the ranking member to act on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is an example of the inaccurate descriptions you're getting.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Just for one question. With regard to your initial comment with regard to the FHA reform and the GSE reform, my comment saying that it hasn't been done, isn't it true that we're 17 months into the year under Democrat leadership? Have those bills passed this House and have those bills made it to the President's desk?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>No, but the gentleman very inaccurately blamed the Democrats. He forgot, Bryan Montgomery said in 2006, the Republicans did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one ought to be more accurate and less partisan in a description of reality. The fact is that those were defeated under the Republicans when he was on the committee. Then, the Democrats did pass them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as to the GSE bill, he said it was the slush fund. I really like that phrase, "slush fund." That's affordable housing for people, for lower income people. He said that's what's holding up the GSE bill. That is not remotely true. The GSE bill was sent by us to the Senate. They haven't taken it up. By the way, the affordable housing trust fund was in the Senate committee version when the Republicans were in power under the current ranking member when he was chairman. So that is just inaccurate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true they have been held up in the Senate as they were held up under the Republican leadership as well. We are closer to passing them. I am confident that they are going to get passed fairly soon. We did finally get to some conversation on the FHA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My objection was that the gentleman acted as if the world was created in January of 2007 and the Democrats refused to pass the bill, neglecting to note that the head of the FHA himself put the blame much earlier when the Republicans were in power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish to address specifically the amendment that Mr. LaTourette and I have offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the worst of the foreclosure crisis is yet to come. Mr. Frank just corrected incorrect factual assertions. Let me correct one as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Feeney said a few minutes ago or gave the example of a 3 percent teaser rate. Mr. Speaker, the typical initial rate for the mortgages that are causing this problem was 8 1/2  percent, which is already well above the conventional prime rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to The Wall Street Journal, 55 percent of the people who got those loans qualified for prime loans. Their trust was betrayed. And the typical adjustment after just 2 or 3 years was a 30 to 50 percent higher monthly mortgage payment. Seventy percent had prepayment penalties so people couldn't get out and would have to pay when they got out, when they refinanced out of a loan they could not possibly afford and the lender never intended they would afford because they required they come  back and refinance again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not surprising that 3 million homeowners with subprime loans are expected to enter foreclosure proceedings in the next couple of years and 2 million of them will likely lose their homes. Another 40 million homeowners will see the value of their homes decline when other homes in their neighborhood are foreclosed, and they will lose $200 billion in their home property values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Credit Suisse now estimates that there is another wave of foreclosures coming after this one as even more exotic, innovative mortgages go into default. Credit Suisse estimates that in the next 5 years 12.7 percent of homeowners with mortgages are expected to lose their homes to foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when those families lose their home to foreclosure most will fall out of the middle class and into poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The policy failures that caused this problem, that led to this crisis, were in Washington, but State and local government are having to deal with the consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Property rights, contracts and foreclosure proceedings are all matters of State law, not Federal law. The laws vary from State to State, but every State's foreclosure law includes protections for the borrowers whose homes are being seized and sold to pay the mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>State laws have notice requirements. They provide reasonable time for the families who are losing their homes to find someplace else to live and to move; they limit the costs that they be charged to homeowners; they allow homeowners to cure defaults in some circumstances. Many States limit or prohibit deficiency judgments if the sale of the home is not enough to pay off the debt, and on and on. And several States, not surprisingly, are now considering additional laws to protect borrowers who  are losing their homes to foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, there has been some suggestion, some hint in the press and elsewhere that if State and local governments start getting underfoot, if they start making a nuisance of themselves, the lending industry will argue that some of the especially annoying State laws, State foreclosure proceedings cannot be applied to mortgage holders or mortgage services that are affiliated with national banks or trusts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no Federal foreclosure law, but they argue that State foreclosure proceedings could be preempted by Federal laws that govern national banks and trusts. This amendment clarifies that State laws and local ordinances on foreclosure and foreclosed properties are not preempted by Federal law.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I've spent nearly three decades in the housing business. And over those three decades the housing market has gone up and the housing market has had its soft moments, and one of the soft moments we're experiencing today. I liken it to the fact that the housing market has a cold. And when you go to the doctor and you talk to the doctor about a cold, what does he usually tell you? He says, you know, you're going to have to let it run its course. And quite honestly, over the years as  these housing downturns have happened, that exactly what we've had to do is let these markets run their course. And what we do know is that when they run their course, that they come back a lot stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have just come off an unprecedented run in housing where the rise in home ownership has risen to record levels. And how did we do that? Well, we did it with the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things about this bill that bothers me is that we leave people with the understanding that if their house goes down, the government will come in and make up the difference. We can't do that. People buy stocks, people buy bonds, people buy other assets. They go up, they go down. But it's not the role of the Federal Government to create a profit opportunity for people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that we know is that, as the ranking member, I think, pointed out, is that we have 110 million people that are already meeting their own housing needs. Some of them are having problems, yes, they are, and we're sorry about that. We know about 51 million people in America have mortgages. And a lot of those folks are taking second jobs and doing things to make sure that they meet their rental payments and meet their housing payments. And you look at the fact that 94, 95 percent  of those people are making those payments, not only are they making them in full, but they're making them on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we can't let the Federal Government be is the piggy bank when things don't go exactly the way we planned. I would like to go back over my 30 years in the real estate business and wish the Federal Government could have been my piggy bank when I bought property that didn't go in the right direction. Some of it went down, some of it went up. But what I do know is that it is important that the Federal Government not get into the business of trying to manipulate markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Markets are very efficient. In fact, they're a lot more powerful than the Federal Government. I know everybody here feels like they may be a powerful person and part of a powerful government, but quite honestly, these free markets are much more powerful than the Federal Government and they're much more efficient and they're much better able to deliver a housing market that the American people can sustain and count on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so that's one of the reasons that I rise in opposition to this bill today is, as I look across America--and I wish you could have been at a town hall meeting with me the other day where people weren't asking about mortgages, Mr. Speaker, they were asking when is this Congress going to finally do something about getting a comprehensive energy strategy for America? When are we going to open up the ability to drill in these other areas? And when are we going to be able to come up with more nuclear  power plants?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people don't want to make their neighbor's payment when they're having a hard time making their own.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I yield 3 minutes to a very hardworking member of the committee, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>You know, I'm wondering whether the Republicans are looking at the same America I'm looking at, and that the American people are feeling. Between 7,000 and 8,000 American families file for foreclosure every day. While we were up here debating this bill the last day and today over 15,000 American families have filed for foreclosure. We have a crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to deal with three points here right quick in my 3 minutes. The  first one is this: I think it is wrong as wrong can be for the other side to continually blame this crisis on the backs of the American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read here for a moment from this morning's Hill newspaper, and I hope that you all will read this as well, this article by J. Morton Davis of the Harvard Business School, an economist. He tells you what the cause of this is and who is to blame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because mortgage originators themselves were not taking any of the risk of holding this paper and were being well paid by providing mortgages to Wall Street banks that were packaging them, they became more aggressive, less demanding of the conditions traditionally required upon them. The mortgage brokers and bankers introduced a whole series of new criteria that made it easier to obtain a mortgage, they introduced nothing down, no equity mortgage, interest-only mortgage, no income, no job requirement  as sufficient basis to receive the mortgage. That's why we're in the condition that we're in, not on the backs of the poor American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on to say that "the changes in lending practices actually transformed what were solid, safe, secure mortgage loans into instruments that were inferior even to the subprime mortgages. The cause of this can be traced to the simple fact that the providers of these mortgages did not end up holding the paper and thus were far less concerned about the quality of the loan." Because nobody bothered to look at or take issue with the enormously changed quality of these underlying mortgages, not  the Federal Reserve, they didn't look at it, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, not the rating agencies, not even we here in Congress, who surely should have been more responsible and accountable, and not the many Wall Street banks that were coining the money, just as they did. The whole world is now suffering the pain, the outsized losses and the damage to its banking systems and economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of this Congress, it is not the American homeowner who is the cause of this, he is the victim, and it's our responsibility to provide the response for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the other point I wanted to make is I have a copy in my hands here of the Congressional Budget Office co-assessment. Let's put to bed once and for all, this is not $300 billion of the taxpayers' money. The taxpayers' money that's going to this, as clearly as put out in this estimate, is $1.7 billion just to run the program, another $300 million for administrative support, and the counseling of $400,000. And then Mrs. Biggert's own program for counseling of $300 million. That's $2.7  million of the taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's do facts right. That's why we need to pass this bill, Mr. Speaker. Let us stop fooling around and give the American people some relief.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Barrett.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this bill, which I think is unhelpful for the housing market and unfair to the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of my colleagues, I'm concerned that this program will only distort housing prices, causing problems in the future by forcing the taxpayer to foot the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no doubt that some of the lending practices in the beginning of the decade, Mr. Speaker, were irresponsible, and that the government should take certain steps to help the market right itself and to prevent these problems from recurring in the future. At the same time, I'm a firm believer in the power of the free market, and I believe that the housing market fundamentally reflects the laws of supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm always wary of government intervention in the markets and concerned about unintended consequences. I fear that in our rush to help, we are overlooking the basic realities about today's housing market and about the cost of government spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we can all agree that government programs cost money, and this program has the potential to cost a tremendous amount of money. And that money comes from the taxpayer, Mr. Speaker. Because, in reality, like the laws of supply and demand, decisions have consequences, and money has to come from somewhere. It's not fair to ask my constituents from South Carolina, who work hard and spend wisely and pay, in my opinion, too much tax money, to carry the burden for others' financial mistakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe that people in need deserve our understanding and our help, I trust in the ability of the free market to correct itself. And I think Americans know how best to spend their money and should be trusted to make their own financial decisions. I also think that lenders have a responsibility to live with the consequences of investments that did not quite turn out as planned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I offered an amendment in the Financial Services Committee that is representative of my concerns. The amendment was not adopted, and it was very simple. It was to strike the section of the bill that prohibits FHA from denying borrowers entry into the new FHA program solely on the basis of the mortgagor's current FICO or other credit scores, or any delinquency or default by the mortgagor. In South Carolina talk, Mr. Speaker, this amendment would have given the FHA the opportunity  to use individual pieces of information on their own that reveal the risk of borrowers defaulting. In offering the amendment, I wanted to allow the FHA to protect the American taxpayer by giving them every tool available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the motivations of this section of the bill to try to include as many people as possible in the program meant to help them. And I understand it would be nice if we could help all of these borrowers, but some may have very bad credit scores that reflect irresponsible borrowing behavior. It's not fair to the American taxpayer to insure the loans of the riskiest borrowers who may not be able to pay their mortgages no matter what the terms of the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a doubt, it's never easy to hear the stories of hardworking individuals and families losing their homes, but I do not believe that more government intervention is the solution to our problems. And we should not allow the American taxpayers to become the insurance policy for the financial decisions that did not turn out as planned or for temporary market downturns. We should not punish those hardworking and responsible American taxpayers for the mistakes of a few. For these reasons, and  others, I oppose this legislation and ask my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of people are losing their home in this country. In fact, in California, 500 families or more lose their home every day. And that not only hurts them, but the neighbors around them. Because of foreclosure, their home value drops weekly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't support government bailouts. I consider this bill we're dealing with here far from a government bailout. If you look at the situation people are in today, people are suffering from shrinking paychecks, other things go wrong in their life. But this loan is the most expensive FHA loan you will get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Normally, a person can go to get an FHA loan, put 3 percent down, and the government will basically be guaranteeing 97 percent financing. Under this loan, the lender has to be willing to take 85 percent of current market value. Let me explain that so it makes it understandable to most people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's say you bought a house for $580,000. The first trustee gets $5,000, but current market value is $400,000 for that house. The people are upside down, they can't make the payment, it is going into foreclosure. The lender has an opportunity to allow another lender to buy them out with an FHA loan guarantee, and they're willing to take $340,000 for a loan they have that the market today is $400,000, and the new loan against that house will be $360,000. Now, that sounds really good. And we say  the person is going to make a lot of money, it's a bailout. But this is really more like a joint venture. And I don't think CBO even scores this portion. If you sell the home the first year, we either get 3 percent of the loan amount or 100 percent of the profit on the home, whichever is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't know how most people look at it, but that's the worst FHA loan you can get. It's not a bailout, but it's enabling a person who's losing their home and a lender who says, well, if I foreclose it on $400,000, I might get $380,000, $390,000. And what does that do to a neighborhood? That home that originally sold for $580,000, now the market value for that home in that neighborhood is now $380,000, $390,000 or $400,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is more like a refi. It doesn't impact the value of the homes in the community. It basically helps a person get in position where they can retain ownership of their hone. And they're not going to make a windfall profit for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the chairman for introducing language in this bill that I worked on for 5 years, and that's raising conforming home limits in high-cost areas. Basically, Freddie and Fannie and FHA, in high-cost areas, you can borrow a maximum of a $730,000 loan from them today. The biggest problem we've had in the marketplace in recent years is people have been forced into jumbo loans. If you look at a GSE loan, that's Freddie and Fannie, compared to a jumbo loan today, you can generally  save about 100 basis points in interest rates. That's a huge amount of payment a person can save each year, enable a person to be able to put away money in the future for house payments if times get tough and basically own their own home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people have said they don't trust the Refinance Program Oversight Board because they don't have any idea what the Board is going to implement as far as criteria to qualify for this loan. I have a problem believing that we can't trust the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of HUD and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to come up with criteria based on income, assets, liability, payment history, other criteria, debt-to-income ratio. If we can't trust those three individuals to come  up with a reasonable criteria under which this loan is made, I think we're in trouble in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem some people have is FHA exists. FHA loans are made today, and FHA is guaranteeing, through insurance premiums, these loans. Now, a normal FHA insured premium costs a borrower .55 percent per year, about half a percent. Under this new program, they have to pay 1.5 percent per year to FHA to underwrite this guarantee. That's far from a giveaway. I can't see anything in this FHA loan that's a giveaway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's a general sense, Mr. Speaker, that it's this bill or nothing, and that certainly isn't true. In fact, much has been done. As has been talked about, the FHA Secure program has created greater flexibility, helping hundreds of thousands stay in their homes. The Hope Now program has already helped 1.4 million individuals stay in their home, getting borrowers and lenders together. Loan limits have been increased, FHA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates.  So the notion that the Federal Government has been unresponsive or slow to move is disingenuous and is repeated as fact solely as an excuse for the Democrats to continue outbidding each other on how much taxpayer funding they can spend or bail out imprudent borrowers who either bought too much house or lenders who were gladly willing to give them the money. So much has been done to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also heard the chairman and others say that it's unlikely that this will cost $300 billion, that it will only be $2.4 or $2.7 billion. Well, then why doesn't the bill say that? It doesn't, Mr. Speaker, because the taxpayer will be on the hook for risky loans and the number may significantly rise, and that's because this bailout plan irresponsibly disregards borrowers' payment history and credit scores. Borrowers could have missed the majority of their monthly payments over the life of  the loan; yet those borrowers would still be eligible for a government-backed mortgage, and taxpayers would be on the hook. Americans don't believe that's fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has also been discussion about the voluntary nature of this program. However, Federal Reserve Board Governor Randall Krozner said in our committee, "If Congress decides to move down this road, then it should carefully consider the steps that should be taken to mitigate moral hazard, avoid adverse selection, and ensure that the financial interests of the taxpayer are adequately safeguarded."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if you listen to the chairman, this program isn't so voluntary. At that same hearing, the chairman said, "If we were to get this approach adopted but we don't get much of a voluntary buy into this, then I have to say the response will probably be more regulation than people might like to see."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on in an article quoted yesterday here in Washington to say, "Meanwhile Chairman Frank has warned the mortgage industry that if it doesn't support something like this plan this year, it could be in for far more regulation next year." And that article went on: "If after this we continue to get very little participation by servicers, I can guarantee you that the servicer industry will look very different ..... If after everything we do in this cooperative way falls short, then  you are going to see legislation that puts some very real restrictions on the role of servicers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of a sudden, Mr. Speaker, this program doesn't sound so voluntary. It seems to me that the chairman's comments will exacerbate the moral hazard that the Federal Reserve Governor warned us against.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the incentives, the chairman provides in his legislation for holders of mortgages, and they are real and enticing. We have actual threats of harmful regulation if they don't sign up dutifully for this program. That's not voluntary.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that these threats do no favors to the American taxpayers across our country. The chairman is ensuring that we will get full and active participation in this program, populated by the riskiest of loans with enormous redefault rates and cost to the American taxpayer of up to $300 billion. Mr. Speaker, that's irresponsible and it's unwise.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), member of our full committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400424" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was listening to this debate, and the only thing I could be reminded of was a few years ago when I had a very, very serious political campaign mounted against me and that had about $800,000 spent on television ads telling people how terrible I was, and at the end of the campaign, my mother finally called me and said, "Are you really that bad?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't recognize the bill that's being described here on the floor. Title II and title III we have overwhelmingly passed previously. Title V was overwhelmingly passed out of the Financial Services Committee. And all of the representations that are made about title I seem to me to be just outrageously overstated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like FHA is going to assume all of this responsibility. This is a bailout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a voluntary program. FHA is not out soliciting any of these loans. They will evaluate the credit worthiness of everyone who comes to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like this will cost $300 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no way this program will cost $300 billion unless every single person who gets involved in it defaults and we get nothing out of a foreclosure or reclaiming of the property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like this is going to benefit speculators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill explicitly says that this is limited to homeowners, not people who have been speculators. I don't know what else we could say on that. The language is absolutely explicit that only homeowners qualify for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or maybe like the most outrageous one that I've heard today: Well, the market will take care of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the market is how we got here in the first place. If the market had been taking care of this, we wouldn't be in this crisis. We wouldn't be having the problem that we are trying to solve. And so this notion that the market is somehow going to overnight correct itself and we will solve this problem solely through market forces just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. But, again, my mother started to question after a while, after people said it over and over and over again. Maybe my colleagues  think if they say it enough, that this is terrible, they will convince somebody.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to introduce another member of the Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are many good and decent people who are in financial distress right now across this country. Some with mortgages they can't afford. Some made poor financial decisions. Some were victims of fraud. Some were simply speculators acting on their instincts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the reality is that most borrowers are paying on time. They are making their mortgages; 92 percent of borrowers are paying on time across this country; 6 percent are late but not yet in foreclosure, and 2 percent are actually in foreclosure. This bill is directed to the 2 percent on the backs of the 98 percent. That means that 110 million households are meeting their obligations. This legislation under consideration today would require that those 110 million families bail out the lenders  on Wall Street. And I will tell you it's simply a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are sending the message to financial institutions and Wall Street investors that when those investors make poor choices and take ill-advised risks that the Federal Government will step in and bail them out. That's a bad decision. In fact, this is a $300 billion taxpayer bailout that will cost the American taxpayer $5,000 for every foreclosed loan that is dumped into the program. And make no mistake about it. They will be dumped into the program. And it's not the homeowners who will control  this. It will be the lenders and servicers who will decide to take advantage of this for their own personal advantage, the servicers and the lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing that we know for sure is that those lenders and servicers are only going to submit those loans that they don't believe will pay. The American taxpayer will instead be punished. Ultimately, the real losers are the American taxpayers who are left to guarantee the loans that nobody else wants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the past couple of months, I received several calls, letters, conversations I have had with my constituents, talking about the struggles that they are making in order to pay their mortgage. They don't want to have to pay somebody else's mortgage. They are struggling enough to make their ends meet with high gas prices, the rising cost of health care. And I'm not advocating that we do nothing. In fact, I have been working very hard in my district with foreclosure prevention seminars,  working with the Hope Now alliance, which has helped 1.4 million homeowners stay out of foreclosure, keep their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the things that Congress should be doing, is helping individuals get through this crisis. We shouldn't have a massive bailout of lenders on Wall Street. We shouldn't bail out the servicers. They took ill-advised risks, and as such, the losses should be carried by them, not by my constituents who are paying on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's oppose this legislation and do what's reasonable and right for the taxpayer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to a very hardworking member of the committee who contributed to this bill, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mahoney).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412197" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say that I'm extremely disappointed that the President and many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have expressed opposition to this legislation. I think it's telling that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has expressed his support for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President and some of my Republican colleagues have called this plan a bailout. Clearly, the party that claims to represent big business doesn't understand business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan requires current mortgage holders who choose to participate, not taxpayers, to realize the loss of at least 15 percent. And by putting homeowners in mortgages with rates and payments that we know they can afford, we are minimizing the risk of future defaults. And by doing so, we are injecting confidence and liquidity back into credit markets, thereby taking an important step to ensure the economy has the capital to begin digging ourselves out of this recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For anyone who calls this a bailout of risky investors, I would invite them to come to my district and meet some of the thousands of families who are in foreclosure. These are families with dreams and hopes. They, like everyone in this room, were trying as best they could to live the American Dream of homeownership. These are not frauds and cheats. They are firefighters and teachers who were forced into the subprime mortgage market in order to realize their dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only moral hazard before us today would be our failure to act. If we are to protect our economy, our families, and the American Dream of homeownership, pass this amendment today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce another distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), and I yield to him 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, have I ever told you about my dog, Max? I don't think I have. Let me just take a minute and tell you about Max.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like a lot of us who are fathers of younger children, I have four children, who approached me, Mr. Speaker, and begged me and begged me and begged me to get them a dog. And for years I was able to avoid eye contact and was able to keep an animal out of my house. But, finally, in a moment of weakness, I said yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And a friend of mine, Mr. Speaker, realized what was happening, and he pulled me aside and he said, "Look, if you're going to get a dog, realize this: You get what you pet." You get what you pet. So if a dog comes in and it's disobedient and you pet that dog and give it all kinds of affirmation, then guess what. It's going to keep being disobedient. And not being very wise, we started to do that, and so now we've got a slightly out-of-control dog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why do I mention Max? We're on the verge of doing that same type of conduct exactly to people who have fundamentally made some bad decisions. Let's take the borrowers aside, and I realize the chairman has worked hard, but let's take the borrowers aside and just put them in a different category because what we're going to be doing today, in addition to helping borrowers, is really bailing out lenders. And I don't think that's an overcharacterization. I don't think that's an unfair way of  looking at this. We are being told that lenders who were in this, who are great advocates of the free market when they're making money, they love the free market when they're making money, and now all of a sudden, they are coming to the Federal taxpayer and saying this has gotten a little bit more complicated than we thought, and now we want the taxpayers to come in and take care of this from here out. It's voluntary on the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we can do a lot better, I think, over a period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There is a great willingness, Mr. Speaker, on this side of the aisle to try and work creatively and to try and work substantively on solutions. But I think as we reflect back on this, in the  chairman's own words, it is going to cost $5,000 for every defaulted mortgage that is assumed by the FHA, times a half million. That gets us to the $2.5 billion figure that makes many of us cringe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I don't think that those types of numbers should be allocated to lenders and bailing out lenders who made bad decisions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I yield 1 minute to the majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not about petting dogs. This is about people who are hurting. This is trying to reach out to people who have been savaged in many ways by this economy and the policies that have led to an economy where average working incomes are down $1,000 and where gasoline prices have exploded over 200 percent from $1.46 to $3.56. I would remind you that under the Clinton administration they went from $1.06 to $1.46, 5 cents a year during the 8 years of the Clinton administration. They are going up  5 cents a week during this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People are stretched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't hear people come to this floor and say $30 billion for Bear Stearns. It was outrageous, putting the taxpayers' money--Mr. Flake says he did. Thirty billion dollars. We just talked about $2.5 billion for literally tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps as many as 1 million people. There is a crisis, and they have asked us to respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate the chairman of our committee. I want to thank the ranking member of the committee. I want to thank all the members of the committee for giving this their attention and trying to come up with a solution that works. Was this a partisan, divisive solution? Absolutely not. The Secretary of the Treasury has said that this is a product that merits serious consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a time, I thought he was for it. I am not sure now. There seems to be some internal division within the administration. Mr. Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that this is a good thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, today through this comprehensive landmark legislation, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act, this House is going to act not to pet dogs but to help people. This House will take decisive action to keep hundreds of thousands of families at risk of foreclosure in their homes and will help stabilize the housing markets across the Nation that have been wracked by an unprecedented drop in home values over the last 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake: The slumping housing market has had negative, rippling effects throughout our economy. It is not just people in houses that are having problems, but the subprime crisis has affected our entire country and the availability of credit. And thus it is imperative that we take responsible, reasonable steps such as this to strengthen our weak economy and ultimately benefit not just those who are at risk of losing their homes, but every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke pointed out in a speech on Monday, Monday, just a few days ago, at Columbia University, "High rates of delinquency and foreclosure can have substantial spillover effects on the housing market, the financial markets, and the broader economy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the answer is, don't pet your dog. It was bad behavior. Leave him alone. Or punish him. What we want to do is help people do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He continued: "Therefore, doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interests of lenders and borrowers, it's in everybody's interest." Those are Bernanke's words. Not Chairman Frank's. Not mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what this legislation, the product of hard work by Chairman Barney Frank and so many others, is designed to do: Avoid preventable foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is little question that after an historic housing boom in the first half of this decade we now are faced with a housing crisis. Foreclosures soared to an all-time high in the last quarter of 2007. According to Mortgage Bankers Association, more than 1.2 million properties received foreclosure notices in 2007, up 75 percent from 2006. And 1 in 33 homeowners is projected to be in foreclosure over the next 2 years. So much for a great economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, in short, will expand the FHA program so that borrowers in danger of losing their homes can refinance into lower-cost, government-insured mortgages that they can afford to repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've heard so much talk about a family-friendly Congress. Family values. Caring about children. What can be more family friendly than keeping families in their homes? I think not too many things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to be clear, this bill will minimize taxpayer exposure. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of putting homeowners into affordable loans under the bill would be not $30 billion, not $20 billion, not $10 billion, but a total of $2.7 billion. A few days in Iraq. A few days in Iraq. Not a month. A few days in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrary to the rhetoric coming from some, this bill is not a bailout for irresponsible lenders or borrowers. Only primary residences are eligible. Investors and lenders must take significant losses, as they should. The owner of the old mortgage can only receive 85 percent of the current value of the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in return for an FHA guarantee on the mortgage, borrowers must share with the government any profit from the resale of a refinanced home. The government will only have liability if the borrower defaults and the amount recovered in foreclosure is below the outstanding debt still owed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this legislation includes tax provisions to expand refinancing opportunities and to spur home buying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It increases the VA home loan limit for high-cost housing areas, which we passed before, enabling veterans to have more homeownership opportunities. We are having people come home from Iraq. We are going to be talking about that. They may have lost their home because they went to Iraq and they couldn't keep their home. This helps them get back in a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it includes FHA modernization provisions that have already passed this House, as well as GSE reforms such as strengthening the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and raising their loan limits to increase liquidity in the mortgage market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Frank has talked to Secretary Paulson about that. I have talked to Secretary Paulson about that. I am sure many of you on your side of the aisle have talked to Secretary Paulson about that. He thinks this is absolutely essential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's mitigate the effects of the bursting of the housing bubble. Let's prevent hundreds of thousands, and perhaps up to 1 million people, from foreclosure and allow American families to stay in their homes through this responsible legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's stabilize our housing market and help millions and millions of homeowners who are not at risk of foreclosure, but whose neighbors are at risk for foreclosure, and if they are foreclosed upon, will see their home values deteriorate. So the assistance is not just to those at risk of foreclosure, but to all those who are in communities where homes are at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's pass this comprehensive, bipartisan legislation today and work to get it to the President's desk without delay. I am hopeful that the President will see fit to sign it. Vote "yes." Vote "yes" on the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Vote "yes" for the families of America.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I yield myself 30 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the distinguished majority leader said, this is about people hurting. He should know. Since his Democrat majority came into office almost 18 months ago, we know that we have a $3,000 per family tax increase that has been approved, gasoline at almost $4 a gallon, milk over $4 a gallon. Yes. This is about people hurting, particularly the 98 percent that rent, that have paid off their mortgages and whose mortgages are current.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if this bill is only going to cost the taxpayers $2.7 billion, why do we see $300 billion written in the bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona, JEFF FLAKE.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Massachusetts knows the respect I have for his knowledge of free market economics. He often scolds us on this side of the aisle when our rhetoric doesn't match our actions. And he is often justified in doing so. I have heard him quote Adam Smith and Milton Friedman with the best of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I was baffled to see this bill come to the floor from his committee, a bill that violates the same principles that he has chastened us for not recognizing. He was right then. And he is inconsistent and wrong today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has "moral hazard" written all over it. We know that a party insulated from risk behaves differently than a party that is fully exposed to risk. The truth is here we are insulating home buyers and home owners from risk. And we will simply prolong the housing crisis by doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be real here. The purpose of this legislation is to insulate political parties from risk. That is what we are doing here. If we felt such a need to intervene here, we ought to remember what we did last September when I believe, if I remember right, we encouraged FHA to give no-money-down loans. Why is it that we think that we are so prescient here about what is going to happen?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't outguess the market. We shouldn't try to. We simply will delay the bottom and delay and increase the dislocations that will occur when its politicians decide to allocate resources and capital rather than the markets.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says, why isn't the $2.7 written into the bill? It is, in effect, because it is subject to appropriation, and no money will be spent until that is provided. The $300 billion is the number of mortgages that could be insured, up to that. We needed to put that number there before CBO could tell us how much it would cost. And written into this bill before it becomes law and becomes operational will be that $2.7 billion figure. That is the way the process works. You get a CBO score, and then you  pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois, a very diligent member of our committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400631" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, section 505 of title V of this legislation contains language pertaining to the treatment of disabled veterans in the bankruptcy code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every Member of the House supports ensuring that no disabled veteran is discriminated against for obtaining federally supported housing loans or subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, can you clarify for me why this provision was included in the bill, and why we need to protect disabled veterans from discrimination in this legislation?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman will yield, I know sometimes conspiracy theories rattle around this place. The reason we put in the legislation to protect disabled veterans who had bankruptcy from being excluded from this program is to protect veterans, disabled veterans who have been in bankruptcy from being in this program. There were people who suggested that the sensitivity people would have in bankruptcy could be a problem. Now I will point out, by the way, that thanks to  some very good amendments by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) who has dealt with this problem in a more general way, and he is a bankruptcy expert--from the law side not the subject side. But we thought with disabled veterans, we know this engenders prejudice</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400631" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there have been reports suggesting that this provision could be used as a placeholder for a broader expansion of the Federal bankruptcy laws. Can you clarify that this language will not be expanded in conference to include a broader re-write of the Nation's bankruptcy laws or to be used in conference for any other redrafting of language encompassed under title 11 of the U.S. Code other than this specific provision?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman will yield, absolutely I can guaranty that. I should be clear. I am cosponsor of the bill that would have provided a bankruptcy avenue for primary residences. That is a separate issue as far as I am concerned. No, this particular provision will not be a vehicle for that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I guarantee this provision will only be what it is. If anybody wants to move elsewhere, I might support that. But entirely separate from this, this will not be a vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I think it would be dishonorable for anyone. We have had too many examples of people trying to use veterans, and particularly disabled veterans, as a political stick to achieve other objectives. I would find that to be an absolutely outrageous procedure, and I can guarantee you it will not happen.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had originally planned to talk about something else altogether, but it's the nature of the debate that causes me to simply say I do view this as a bailout of sorts, but it's not a bailout for the borrowers, it's not a bailout for the lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you understand the bill, you understand that actually the deals that the borrowers get are not particularly good. The deals that the lenders get are not particularly good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is intended, if it works, as a bailout generally for all those innocent homeowners and taxpayers who have been dragged into this mess in part, because of our failure to regulate previously, in part because of the incompetence, virtually, the pitiful performance the of the rating agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, an awful lot of people, and our economy, are being hurt. I view, this personally, as a bailout for the economy, with an incidental effect of avoiding foreclosures in individual cases--and that's nice. It's nice to help people out--but I am not voting for this thing because it's helping individuals out and happens to help a few lenders out. It's not a bailout for those folks. In my view it's a bailout for the entire economy and all of these people that have been dragged into it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for the time, and I thank the chairman for his tireless efforts to bring this to the floor. I question this moral hazard argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I question it because I have to ask myself, where was the moral hazard  when we bailed out Penn Central? Penn Central got more than laissez faire. Penn Central got more than market forces. Penn Central got $7 billion in a bailout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where was the moral hazard when we bailed out Lockheed Martin, $250 million? Franklin National Bank, $1.7 billion bailout. For the good of the country, we bailed out Chrysler at the tune of $1.5 billion; Continental Illinois, $4.5 billion; Farm Credit System, $4.5 billion; First Republic Bank, $1 billion. Major airlines got $5 billion, the steel companies got $7 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where was the argument about Bear Stearns that was never brought to the floor? I have heard about a letter that has been circulated. Why didn't you bring the argument to the floor? Let's talk about the Bear facts, the Bear Stearns facts. Bear Stearns got $29 billion in a bailout and a $13 billion loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if you really talk about the Bear facts, the Bear Stearns facts, you are talking about $42 billion. We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right, they must look right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't look right for this country to continually bail out major corporations. When the American people, little people as we sometimes call them here--they are big in my heart--but the little person needs some help, we don't find it within our hearts and our power to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the ability to make a difference in the lives of people today. This is why I am encouraging my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I represent Stockton, California, which unfortunately has the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Many families in northern California have lost their homes and the foreclosures have lead to personal hardships, community instability and national economic risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When my constituents asked me what Congress was doing to fix the economy, I told them we are pushing to create family-wage jobs and put money back in people's pockets. Today we are building on these efforts by considering legislation that will provide fiscally responsible options for families struggling to stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last December I hosted a workshop for foreclosures in Stockton with my colleague, DENNIS CARDOZA, to provide housing counseling to local families. While we expected the turnout to be high, participants started lining up 2 hours early and, ultimately, more than 500 people showed up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard heart-breaking stories from my constituents, and this is just one single illustration of why today's legislation is so important. One of the biggest challenges facing the housing market is in the high-cost States, like California, that housing programs have not kept pace with the times. Unrealistically low limits for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA mean people living in the high-cost States have not fully benefited from these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economic stimulus package, temporary loan limit increase to $730,000, raising the loan limit, injects liquidity into the mortgage market to provide access to credit and opens new opportunities for refinancing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, since these increases are only temporary, it is clear that making them permanent will have beneficial effects for the housing market. I introduced the Homeowner Opportunity Act to permanently raise the loan limits, and I am pleased that today's legislation includes my bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Frank for all of his support and assistance. This change will benefit my constituents and the entire country.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I just want to thank you and the committee for bringing a very focused piece of legislation to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to my friends from Texas, who have heard stories that this is a bailout, this is no bailout. This is about Strasbourg, Colorado, where there have been foreclosures around a neighborhood, and one person trying to sell their property can no longer do that because the value of their house is less than their mortgage. They are innocent. They didn't deserve this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly in Edgewater, Colorado, where the lender, the appraiser and the building owner got into cahoots, and a young couple buys a condominium, and now the properties around them are foreclosed. They are going to lose this property. They need assistance. They are innocent. They deserve some help from this government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Same thing in Commerce City, Colorado. I heard all of these stories last night on a telephone town hall meeting while we were debating the Neighborhood Stabilization Act. That's what this bill is about. It's about the community as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Marshall from Georgia understands what this bill is about. It's about looking after our neighborhoods and protecting our neighborhoods and averting 500,000 foreclosures across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our neighborhoods, our cities, our towns are going to pay for this if the Federal Government doesn't assist in some fashion. This is a nationwide problem. The Nation has to stand up. We have to deal with this. This bill does it in so many ways, and I just appreciated coming to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote "yes" on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the chairwoman of the Housing Subcommittee, who makes her second appearance today, having carried through passage of a very important bill earlier today, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I would first like to thank our chairman, Barney Frank, for the leadership that he has provided on dealing with a serious problem in America. I would like to thank the Members once more for the support that they gave me on the Neighborhood Stabilization Act that we passed today. That, coupled with what is being done now, will go a long way to providing real assistance to our cities, to our counties, to our States and to our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that it has been said over and over again today that people are suffering, that there are people who got into these loans that did not understand what a no-doc loan, a no interest rate loan was, an ARM that was going to reset within 6 months, 1 year or 2 years, and that the mortgage would double, triple or quadruple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are innocent, hardworking Americans out there every day who simply want to live the American Dream. Many of them were steered into these loans because there was this big, big housing bubble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had these local initiators of loans through our banks and our mortgage brokers who discovered that they could package them, they could securitize them, they would be invested in Wall Street, and the Wall Street people invested mightily in them, and now the services have them all. The only thing that the services can do is foreclose on these properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we can do something about it. I don't know why we have to argue and fight about whether or not we can help the American people. They sent us here to look after their best interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't understand why anybody can call this a bailout when, in fact, nobody has said anything about the bailout of the almost $30 billion for Bear Stearns. If we can help Wall Street, we certainly can help the people who vote for us every day and who sent us here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We help people all over this Nation in different ways. Some people are confronted with a hurricane, or a flood or an earthquake. American citizens expect us to be there for the citizens when we are needed in different ways. This is a different way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask everyone to support the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's my honor now to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Drake), who has an extensive amount of experience in the housing industry and brings great expertise to this process.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, housing is a very complex issue. We are talking about a person's home, real people with a real problem. Prior to Congress I was a realtor for over 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with many families to help them realize their dream of homeownership. I have served as chairman of the Virginia Housing Study Commission. I have seen good markets and bad and many changes to the mortgage industry. I have struggled with how to define and protect against predatory lending practices. I have seen interest rates and loan products that seem too good to be true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we have seen they were too good to be true. There are many components of this bill, which I think are excellent. Enacting those reforms now would have a huge impact on the housing market and be helpful to American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concerns with today's package include the establishment of a new, affordable housing fund and a $300 billion Federal loan guarantee program. A lender with troubled loans could contact those homeowners, offer a federally backed loan and refinance at a loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now he has moved that loan from a complete loss to 85 percent current value that will be guaranteed by the Federal Government. He now has no reason to work with that borrower. Neighbor A bought at the height of the market. He struggles but pays. Neighbor B negotiates 85 percent of current value, a huge impact on the value of surrounding properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a voluntary program. Can't we develop incentives for the private sector and not obligate the American taxpayers with $300 billion in loan guarantees? There are several things that are currently making a difference. The FHA Secure loan program, HOPE NOW, an alliance to prevent foreclosure through outreach to delinquent borrowers. Fannie Mae is currently working on a streamlined short-sale program to allow the sale of properties that are overmortgaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The fact is, one out of two people never contact their lender for help. Both the administration and the private sector need to explain what is available. Neither has done a good job.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, much has been said about how we got into this situation, although someone said it best, I thought: too little oversight, too much greed, too little understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are several things we do understand. There is no single cause for why we got into this housing crisis, so there is no single solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But second, we must act now. This March, there was a 57 percent increase in the number of defaults than the previous March a year ago. And of all of the adjustable rate mortgages that will be reset this year to a higher interest rate, 80 percent are the subprime category. Those subprime categories are at a delinquency twice that of a fixed rate. In short, even before the interest rates go up, we have so many people who are already in trouble with their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, and most importantly, this is not just about the homeowner or the mortgage lender, this is about all of us. What we have seen is not just harming the housing and manufacturing industries, it has seeped over into the bond market for municipal bonds and even for education to where, because of the exposure of bond insurers, we cannot have bonds that are being given in these categories. So, therefore, I think very highly of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this bill is done in the right way. It is providing relief to actual, real people, those living in homes, not speculators. Second, it steps over and it doesn't give any bailout to lenders. It says you must write down your loans and you must pay into a reserve fund and do closing costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, it has the government reaping the rewards when the houses inevitably go back up in value. I think this is great for the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask one thing to consider as we go forward. I am taken by incentivizing people to come forward. And as someone on the other side said, incentivizing them even by being exposed to more risk. The CBO said that out of the 2.8 million foreclosures expected to occur if nothing happens between now and 2013, about 500,000 loans will be refinanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBO believes that many original and secondary lenders will be reluctant to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a problem that must be addressed. To be most effective, I believe that there must be greater incentives for the original lien holders--who take the haircut up front--to have the option to share in some portion of potential profits on resale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those lenders willing to take a bigger piece of the risk upfront (beyond the 85 percent of current market value limit in the bill), there should be added incentive to participate in the upside potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I support this bill because it addresses many of the issues that need to be solved quickly. But I believe that more needs to be done to provide proper incentives to ensure that lenders, who will play a critical role in the economic and housing recovery, will fully participate, and I am prepared to work with the Chairman and House leadership for an appropriate resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the underlying bill, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, and in particular <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill>, the FHA Housing Stabilization and Homeownership Retention Act of 2008, which is part of this housing rescue package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill>. I believe that it is a well-balanced measure that will go a long way towards turning around the housing crisis and address the issues that have resulted in a nationwide economic crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased with title II of the bill which establishes a long-needed Office of Housing Counseling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I commend Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Waters for including it in their bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely appreciate the fact that community-based organizations with expertise in the field of housing counseling will be given a voice in the development of such policies. I am pleased that the bill provides for the building of capacity to provide housing counseling services in areas that lack sufficient services such as large parts of my district in the Rio Grande Valley and in rural America in general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, I applaud Chairman Frank and Congresswoman Waters for including in the bill the authorization of $3 million for public service announcements as part of the act's national public service multimedia campaign. This campaign will help persons facing mortgage foreclosure, elderly persons, persons who face language barriers, and low-income persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to thank them for increasing the availability, affordability, and quality of housing in rural America. And I believe this bill will do more of the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe the product Chairman Frank and Congresswoman Waters have brought to the floor will result in more homeowners remaining in their homes and help stabilize the housing market. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year 1.5 million American households entered foreclosure, and this year the number of American families in danger of losing their homes could be as high as 2 million. These foreclosures could reduce overall economic activity by $166 billion this year as the effects of the mortgage crisis spill over into other sectors of the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Oregon, the foreclosure rate among subprime borrowers increased by 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over 5,000 Oregon families are currently in foreclosure, more than half of whom hold subprime mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this debate is not about facts and statistics. If it were, it would be over by now. By requiring that the holders of debt take a haircut down to 85 percent of current market value, we are  sharing the pain. By requiring that people who are working in order to be eligible for this program are paying at least 35 percent of their income in order to be eligible, we are exercising responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this debate is really about is a matter of values. The values being expounded on the other side of this debate are absolutely astounding, and nothing illustrates it better than a movie I love, "It's a Wonderful Life." George Bailey was the hero of that movie, and he was dealing with a hard-hearted old man named Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter said to George Bailey as he was trying to save American households, "Have you put any real pressure on these people to pay their mortgages?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And George Bailey relied, "Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Then foreclose."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Bailey answers, "I can't do that. These families have children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Not my children," said Mr. Potter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what we hear from the other side is: not my children, these folks are irresponsible, throw them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We clearly have the upper hand in this debate.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this badly needed legislation to the floor today. Millions of families in America are seeing their dream of homeownership turning into a nightmare. Foreclosure rates have reached crisis levels. In California and in many parts of my district, too many families are facing devastation, and entire neighborhoods are on the brink of collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homeownership has been the primary means that most Americans have to accumulate any kind of wealth, to send their kids to college, to start a small business, or to do whatever they want to do to be part of the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Frank for including language in this legislation which I introduced with Senator McCaskill to address the Reverse Mortgage Proceeds Protection Act which protects seniors from losing their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are beginning to see some of the same abuses in the advertising and high-pressure sales of reverse mortgages as we saw in the subprime mortgage crisis. These provisions will ensure that vulnerable seniors are fully informed of hidden costs and pitfalls of reverse mortgages before they sign.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to introduce the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) who is also on the Committee on Financial Services, and I yield 2 minutes to her.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I heard from one of my constituents who said they felt like this bill was not really about rescuing homeowners, they felt like it was another attempt at wealth redistribution. They felt that the risk and the costs that are borne and should be borne by irresponsible lenders, investors, and borrowers are going to end up being transferred to the Federal Government and thereby to the American taxpayer once again. And this time, it is to the tune of $300 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the bill does is the good actors, the 92 percent of all mortgage holders who are paying their mortgage on time, they are going to end up being liable for the irresponsible actions of lenders and speculators. The way my constituencies see it, this is a risky business. This Congress should not send a message that it is acceptable to give up on an obligation because you're going to have a government buyout or a bailout and you are going to be able to cut your personal losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week I did a seminar in my district. I worked with some government and private sector initiatives such as Hope Now, working to help homeowners weather the storm, to get the information to them that they needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is what we should be doing, educating homeowners on the options at their disposal, as opposed to passing measures that reward recklessness and provide a safety net for irresponsibility. Congress does not need to bail out the housing market, it needs to encourage a kick start. I hope that my colleagues will join me and that together we will vote this bill down.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to another very active member of our committee who has been very active on the loan issue, the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400371" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the facts are these: Homeowners have signed mortgages where they can't afford to make the payments, especially as they are adjusted upwards. We need to write-down the principal amount to something that these good homeowners can afford. But we are told "don't bail out the lenders."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two ways to write-down the principal amount of a loan: an involuntary way through the bankruptcy court, and we had a bill before this House which authorized the bankruptcy court in very limited circumstances, very tailored, to write-down the balance of the loan. Don't bail out the lender, just tell the lender they have to take less. That bill is not going to pass. It is opposed by Republicans in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second way is a voluntary way. You make a fair offer to the lender that, if they will write-down the principal amount, then they will get a guarantee of that lesser amount from the government--so at least they will get paid something. Now we are told to vote against this bill because it bails out lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some are giving hypocrisy a bad name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are going to help homeowners, you have to write-down the balance of the loan. And people come to this floor and they say well, we can't do it the voluntary way, and we can't do it the involuntary way; but just as soon as we find some other way, they will be happy to bail out homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The fact is they have voted against using the bankruptcy court to write- down the principal amount and not give the lenders anything. And now they are saying when we make a fair offer to the lenders to do the same thing, we are bailing out the lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a lot of "respect" for anybody who can come to this floor and just say they don't want to help these homeowners at all. That's an honest position. But to say you are against the voluntary and involuntary, that's wrong.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and for his extraordinary leadership on this extremely important housing stimulus package. It is good for the country and good for my constituents in New York City. I strongly support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for this Housing Stimulus Package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is good for our country and it is good for my constituents in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know we are facing a housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreclosures are at record highs, wages are stagnant and the markets continue to be volatile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This housing package will help restore order and provide the roadmap forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the $300 billion voluntary program that would permit FHA to provide up to $300 billion in new guarantees to help refinance at-risk borrowers into viable mortgages, we are doing a number of things to help the mortgage market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are making permanent the current FHA and GSE loan limits we passed as part of our first stimulus package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this limit, the FHA limit in New York City would drop from $729,750 to $362,000 and the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac limit would drop from $729,000 to $417,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill modernizes the reverse mortgage provision administered by FHA, allowing co-ops to be included for the first time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are preserving affordable FHA-insured foreclosed multifamily projects. Including language important to New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes an amendment I offered that will provide for higher loan limits on homes that include a licensed child care facility.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I  think we have had a good discussion here today. Unfortunately, it was a discussion only and there was not opportunity for our side, or really any other Members to participate in this process of offering amendments that could have most likely made this a better piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are several reasons I oppose this bill. Number one is the flawed process. In my tenure in Congress, I have never had a major piece of legislation like this where I am not even going to get an opportunity to cast my vote. I know people who are watching this process are wondering, you mean we have been talking all day about this important piece of legislation that the other side says is very important to the American people, yet their Member of Congress is not going to get a vote on this  process. It is a flawed process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We brought an energy bill over, stripped all of the energy provisions out of it, and we are putting housing into an energy bill. I still don't understand the mechanics of that, and maybe someone later on can explain that to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is also about not saddling the American people who are already struggling to make their own house payments, to make their own rental payments, to pay the highest gasoline prices in the history of this country, and the highest electricity costs and natural gas costs, it is about saddling them now with the payments for their neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the 110 million people who are doing the best they can and want the United States Congress to do is to leave them alone and really start addressing the major issues that are important to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It's about not rewarding bad behavior. We have some lenders, and we have some borrowers that went out and bet that the housing market was going to go up. It didn't go up, and, in fact, unfortunately, in some places, it went down. And now people are faced with a negative equity or a smaller equity in their home. And we are sympathetic to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, I've been in the real estate business for a very long time. I've seen the markets go up. I've seen the markets go down. And sometimes it causes a situation where people don't have as much equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what you have to understand is a lot of people went into this process with no equity. And now this bill says, you know what? We've got a deal for you, because now we're going to help create equity in your house by putting your neighbors at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bad bill. I encourage Members to vote against this bill. I'm sorry. We can't vote against it. Vote against the amendments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How much time is there remaining, Mr. Speaker?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I understand the complaints about the process. Remember, though, that several of the bills being reenacted today have already been fully debated and amended on the floor. There is one that was not subject to the normal--and I'm a general defender of the normal--process. It's the FHA rescue bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will say, in this case, I think it is fair to ask Members to vote for it up or down. It is a very interrelated piece of legislation. It tries to balance cost and incentive. It would be easy to put it out of whack. And in this one case I think it is fair to say you can vote it up or you can vote it down. Members will have a chance to vote on it. While it's in the form of an amendment, if that amendment is defeated, it dies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to address the issue of the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Ohio regarding preemption, because there may be some confusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I personally spoke, today, with representatives of the banking organizations, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers, and the Mortgage Bankers. They took the position that if we were able to adopt the language offered by the gentleman from Ohio, they would find this a bill that they would accept and would not seek to defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of an objection, we weren't able to do this, so technically, yes, they had previously said they were opposed to it in that form. They have also said, after we outlined the procedure that was followed by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) and myself, that it is now acceptable; that is, while we were blocked by an objection from adopting the actual language, the language that was agreed to by them, by the Attorneys  General, by the State bank supervisors, by advocacy groups, will be the language that's in the bill. So let there be no doubt about that. There is no substantive objection to what will happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me talk about the bill. I guess I want to, not damn my bill today with faint praise, but support it. It comes from the economists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), for whom I have a great deal of respect, a man of very high intellectual integrity, he chided me because I have taken a free market position, but not here. And I'll respond this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have opposed systemic interventions in the market. I think it is generally unwise for us to enact legislation which, in an ongoing way, displaces the market. But that's not what we do here. There is a part of the reality of the market that is called market failure. People have won Nobel Prizes, Joe Stiglitz, for work about market failure. Clearly there has been market failure with regard to mortgages. The market failure was the breaking of the lender-borrower relationship and the substitution  of securitization without appropriate countervailing incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill today is no ongoing intervention in the market. It is time limited, and limited in specifics to a subset of mortgages. It seeks to undo, to some extent, to mitigate a market failure. It will leave the market, I believe, stronger going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I accept the gentleman from Arizona's reminding me that I should stay true to free market principles. This bill is true to free market principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me quote one of the leading advocates of free market principles in the English-speaking world, the Economist, called to my attention by the staff of the Financial Services Committee, which has done enormously good work in substantively putting this bill together, and in listening to me talk about it in various ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate both aspects of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's what the Economist said: "The plan is hardly a bailout," talking about this bill. This is a current Economist. "Lenders would have to write down their loans to 85 percent of the current value of a house." By the way, under FHA Security Administration's plan, they can get a 100 percent loan put in. They can get somebody who's defaulted and get them a 100 percent loan. We require an 85 percent writedown to the value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Borrowers would pay a fee for the insurance and give up a share of any later price rise to the government." By the way, they would also be barred for 5 years from taking out a second mortgage. So the borrowers under this, if there was an increase in equity, would have to share much of it with the Government, and the earlier in the process in which they sold out, the more the Government would get. That's not the bailout that people have described.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People worry about moral hazard. I would assure people, no borrower who goes through this process will say at the end of it, "Boy, that was fun. Where do I buy a ticket to get back on Space Mountain?" They will be deterred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we're not relying solely on this. Two-thirds plus of this House, many of my Republican colleagues didn't do it, but many of my Republican colleagues did. We voted for a bill to regulate subprime mortgages going forward. We're not simply relying on people's bad experience. We have put some restrictions on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this is pro-market. The markets now are in trouble because a lot of people who were very smart bought things they shouldn't have bought, including subprime mortgages. And having bought things they shouldn't have bought, they now don't want to buy things they should buy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the little story about the child who touches the hot stove,  and having touched a hot stove and being burned, won't go near the stove. We have investors today who, having touched the hot stove, are staying away from the refrigerator, the sink and the shower because they have been so badly burned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do not adopt appropriate responses to this market failure, we will not cure it, and the lag in investments will continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working through the market here. It is voluntary that a lender says we're going to cut it down. People say, well, they'll dump all their bad loans. Have the Republicans who say that, because many Republicans are with us, so little confidence in the FHA?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing in this bill coerces the FHA to accept a single loan that it finds unlikely to be repaid. And CBO accepts that, because they say of 500,000 loans that they expect to be accepted, the failure rate will be, average out to $4,800 per loan. Do you really think if the loan failed it would only cost us $4,800?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That figure, that $2.4 billion is CBO saying that there won't be many failures because of the criteria that are in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And people have said, what about the people who paid their mortgages? Well, if they live in a neighborhood where there is foreclosure, they're getting hurt. If they live in a city where the property tax revenues are going down, they're getting hurt. And if they live in America, they are in the midst of a recession in which we are losing jobs when we should be gaining them, in which real wages have been pulled down, and the single biggest cause of this recession is the subprime crisis and its  reverberations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a rare case of a microeconomic factor causing a macroeconomic problem. And the market got us into this. And we don't say junk the market. And I know people who have said, oh, the market's way too smart. And people have said to me, you know, some smart people don't agree with this proposal. Well, I agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also have to note that no dumb people got America into this problem. You had to be really smart to understand collateralized debt obligation derivatives. And the problem is that we need to restrain some of their instincts and let the market function again. And it simply will not happen if you simply let it go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's what we say. And, by the way, I supported Hope Now when it came out. But Hope Now had a flaw. It was based on the notion--Members don't even pay attention to this--it was based on the notion that the problem was when the mortgage reset to a higher rate under adjustable rate mortgages, that would be the problem. That hasn't been the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem has been people who owe more than the loan is worth. Some of them were irresponsible in the first place. Some of them made the mistake that almost everybody else made of not foreseeing the depth of the drop in house prices. So Hope Now has been overtaken by events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We here are responding to reality in a way that is pro-market and minimizes the outlay. I hope the bill is passed.</paragraph>
