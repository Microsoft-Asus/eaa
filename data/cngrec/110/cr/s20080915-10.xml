  <chair> The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have an amendment I have filed to the Defense authorization bill, amendment No. 5369. I would like a take a few minutes to discuss it here today. I hope very much that this amendment can be called up. Indeed, I hope the entire intelligence authorization bill could be called up as a part of the compromise on the Defense authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Rockefeller on the Intelligence Committee has done exemplary work to make sure we have a good, intense authorization bill. I hope very much that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will allow that to be called forward and voted on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular amendment I want to talk about now, although it is small, is very important, and in my view it should be noncontroversial. This amendment is cosponsored by Senators FEINSTEIN, ROCKEFELLER, HAGEL, KENNEDY, FEINGOLD, WYDEN, CARDIN, and DODD. I thank all of those Senators for their cosponsorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment is simple. It holds the United States only to standards we already require of our own military, only to standards we ourselves demand of other nations. Put simply, the amendment would require America's intelligence agencies to notify the International Committee of the Red Cross that an individual has been detained and to provide the ICRC with access to that individual in a manner consistent with the practices of the U.S. military. These terms of access are very reasonable, and confidentiality  by the ICRC is maintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said this was an important amendment. Why is this important? Well, President Clinton said it well recently:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's true strength comes from the power of our example, not the example of our power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you really believe in our country and her virtue and in her promise, you understand this, and you understand what grievous and lasting harm America has suffered from this administration's embrace of torture and from this administration's embrace of torture's handmaiden: secret detention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you go down the corridors of history and you survey the evil practices of tyrant regimes, you find one of their most notorious methods of coercion and subjugation is holding prisoners incommunicado. From the oubliettes of Bourbon, France, to Calcutta's Black Hole; from the Gestapo's secret prisons to the Soviet gulags; from medieval dungeons to the bamboo cages of the Killing Fields, secret and anonymous imprisonment has always been the hallmark of the despot. Now the Bush administration has  stamped America with this shameful mark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America long opposed disappearances and secret detentions around the world as incompatible with our principles of liberty and justice. Just this past March, in its 2007 Annual Human Rights Report, the U.S. Department of State criticized the Governments of North Korea, Burma, and Sri Lanka for engaging in "disappearances." Yet, on December 8, 2005, the Bush administration acknowledged that the ICRC did not have access to detainees--to all detainees--held outside of Guantanamo. President Bush  confirmed as much nearly 9 months later when he stated publicly that it had been "necessary" to move certain detainees to an "environment where they can be held secretly."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment should be unremarkable given the historic role of the ICRC. The ICRC has been visiting detainees in connection with armed conflict since 1915. Last year, the ICRC visited 518,000 detainees in 77 countries. This organization visits prisoners, in its words, "to ensure respect for their life, dignity and fundamental right to judicial guarantees." All these notions are part of the bedrock, as we know, of our own Constitution. A seminal text on this subject, "The Treatment of Prisoners  Under International Law," describes the prohibition of incommunicado detention as among the most central of all international prisoner safeguards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ICRC holds this unique role in part because of the way it conducts its business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a visit, the ICRC reports its findings confidentially to the detaining government. The ICRC has said this confidentiality is fundamental to its success, noting that it "makes it easier for the ICRC and the detaining authorities to achieve concrete progress in detention places." Because of the ICRC's approach, this amendment carefully safeguards our national security. There is even flexibility for what are called "imperative considerations of military necessity." Notably, the ICRC has  played an important role for U.S. troops detained by other governments. The American Red Cross reports that the ICRC visited 55 U.S. prisoners of war in Iraq during the first gulf war and three U.S. servicemembers in a Serbian prison during the Kosovo conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In World War II, in the places where the ICRC could operate, it provided badly need assistance to U.S. soldiers. For example, in Shanghai, one of the few areas the Japanese permitted ICRC access to detainees, the ICRC delegate sent the U.S. prisoners of war food and clothing. PFC Floyd H. Comfort, a part of the Wake Island Marine garrison said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it had not been for the International Red Cross, I guess we all would have starved to death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Respected members of our military family recognize that this amendment would strengthen our ability to advocate for appropriate treatment of Americans detained overseas. I would like to place in the Record a letter from 38 retired military leaders, distinguished generals and admirals who have concluded this amendment is a "critical measure to ensure continuing respect for the norm that [ICRC] access must be provided to all captives in wartime."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>September 15, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATORS: As retired military leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces, we write to express our strong support for Amendment Number 5369 to the pending defense authorization bill, originally introduced as section 323 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. We believe this provision, which would require the intelligence community to provide the International Committee of the Red Cross ("Red Cross") with notification of and access to prisoners in U.S. custody in a manner  consistent with the practices of the Armed Forces, is a critical measure to ensure continuing respect for the norm that such access must be provided to all captives in wartime.</narrative>
  <narrative>The U.S. military has a strong interest in all countries upholding this norm. When our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines go into battle, we owe them the assurance that, should they be captured by the enemy, the United States will be able to aggressively assert their rights to humane treatment,  to be held in recognized places of detention, and to be registered with and visited by the Red Cross, which can raise concerns about their treatment. This is important no matter whether military or intelligence agents are holding our people captive. When we violate this norm ourselves, by holding prisoners in secret--"off the books"--denying that they are in our custody and refusing to permit the Red Cross access to them to monitor their treatment, we dangerously undermine our ability to demand</narrative>
  <narrative>This is not just a theoretical concern. In 1993, when U.S. Warrant Officer Michael Durant was captured by forces under the control of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, the United States demanded assurances that Durant's treatment be consistent with the Geneva Conventions and that the Red Cross be given access to Durant, who was seriously wounded, to monitor that treatment. The United States asserted that it would afford Somali forces the same protections. Within five days, the Red Cross was  permitted to visit Durant, and he was subsequently released.</narrative>
  <narrative>We know from painful experience that Red Cross access to captured prisoners can be an important prophylactic against abuse and can help to ensure that we are in compliance with the laws of war in the treatment of those in our custody. Confidential Red Cross reports and recommendations alert military commanders to serious abuses that, left unaddressed, can undermine prison discipline  and--if exposed--undermine the war effort. It was the Red Cross which,  according to a report by Major General George Fay, notified military authorities in Iraq about the abuses at Abu Ghraib, leading to some of the military's first disciplinary actions against those involved.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Red Cross has been visiting prisoners in armed conflict situations since the height of First World War. Under U.S. military policy, the Red Cross is presumptively authorized to have access to prisoners. Moreover, Department of Defense Directive 2310.01E, issued in September 2006, mandates that the Red Cross "be allowed to offer its services during an armed conflict, however characterized, to which the United States is a party."</narrative>
  <narrative>Over time, the Armed Forces have built a mutually beneficial relationship with the Red Cross and have developed well established practices for Red Cross notification and access to prisoners. These practices are tailored to accommodate the demands of battlefield intelligence gathering and detention, and do not interfere with prisoner interrogations.</narrative>
  <narrative>Red Cross notification and access to prisoners is an essential buttress to the integrity of humane treatment obligations under the Geneva Conventions. We strongly support Amendment Number 5369 to the pending defense authorization bill and urge its adoption into law as an important step in restoring the moral authority of the United States and demonstrating the commitment of our Nation to treat all prisoners humanely.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>This letter comes from battlefield warriors and intelligence officers who participated in every major American conflict from World War II until today. One of them, indeed, only 2 1/2  years ago, was a member of our Joint Chiefs of Staff. These flag officers go on to say that "when we violate this norm ourselves, by holding prisoners in secret--`off the books'--denying that they are in our custody and refusing to permit Red Cross access to them to monitor their treatment, we dangerously  undermine our ability to demand that our enemies adhere to it, now and in future wars."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These military leaders also emphasize that the U.S. military's practices for ICRC notification and access to prisoners "are tailored to accommodate the demands of battlefield intelligence gathering and detention and do not interfere with prisoner interrogations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ill-advised course that leads one down to darkness was famously described by Winston Churchill. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit, the carpet ends. A little further on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the dark corridor down which a misguided administration has led America. The sooner we turn back, the stronger and safer America will be. Remember also the Gospel according to Matthew, chapter 25, verses 36 to 40:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This applies even to those who are, to quote from Matthew again, "the least of our brethren" because ultimately it is not about who they are, it is about who we are. And who are we? We are still that city on a hill. We are still a beacon to other nations. The light of our faith in human freedom still brightens the world. And as we trust in God, let's also trust in that faith and freedom, in that faith in America. Let's step back from the dark side, away from the grim tactics of tyrant regimes  and into the light of our faith in America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, around the Halls of Congress this week are some wonderful folks walking around in green shirts trying to save our rural schools and many rural communities across our country. These are folks who come from areas such as mine where the Federal Government owns  much of the land. For decades and decades, in these communities, the secured money for funding schools in our State and for a variety of other services, such as police and  essential needs for counties, has come through Federal timber payments. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, as a result of environmental law changes and other policies these communities have been strapped for funds now for quite some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, the distinguished Senator from Idaho Mr. Craig, and I, wrote legislation that brought essential funds to these communities so they could secure quality education for their students, for their families. But the law expired in 2006. So we sought, then, to extend this program on a multiyear basis. We had a vote in the Senate with overwhelming support for the legislation. Mr. President, 74 Senators voted for it, but the other body was not able to pass the legislation. So at that  time the program was extended for just 1 year, and now it appears unless additional help is passed in this Congress, we are going to see many of these communities simply not able to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been told in my State alone two rural communities would simply have to shut their doors, and we are looking at the prospect of the State taking over those communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason all those folks in the green shirts are walking the corridors this week is they are making one last-ditch effort to get the funding passed before these county governments have to make what are not just drastic cuts to their budgets permanent but cuts that will be so severe, as I have indicated, the communities simply could not survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy tax extenders bill is the last best hope for getting this done, and as a result of the exceptional work done by Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, the multiyear reauthorization of the county payments legislation has been included in their proposal. I think a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been very supportive of this effort. I particularly express my thanks to Chairman Baucus, the distinguished leader; Senator Reid, the chairman  of the energy community, and Senator Jeff Bingaman. All of them have been enormously helpful as we have prosecuted this cause for months on end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Republican side, Senator Grassley has been extraordinarily helpful. Senator Craig, who authored this legislation originally with me, has been very helpful. Senator Smith of my home State continues to strongly support this effort. I am also very grateful to Senator Crapo from Idaho who continually brings up, at practically every session of the Senate Finance Committee, how important it is to reauthorize this proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know in the last few weeks of our fall session it is going to be easy to block legislation and hard to pass it. But I am very hopeful the energy tax legislation, which includes the county payments legislation, which has the strong bipartisan support of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, will prevail in the Senate and will go to the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For literally decades, support from the Federal Government for these essential services, particularly schools in much of the country--but fighting meth, law enforcement, and other essential services in my State--have, in effect, been part of a bigger agreement with the Federal Government. In effect, what happened is something like 100 years ago, when the National Forest System was created, the communities that had largely forested areas said: We are going to offer a benefit to all the people  of this country in terms of the National Forest System, but in return for placing these lands in public ownership, our communities would get support for essential services. For decades and decades that went on, and it was quite beneficial to both sides--to the rural communities and to the Federal Government--and we saw in my home State people from all over the country come and enjoy the National Forest System in Oregon and other communities around the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we saw, in the late 1970s and 1980s, because of the change in environmental policy and changes in the size of the timber cut, the money shriveled up for these rural communities. So it is essential we pass this legislation, particularly for this multiyear purpose,  because it is our sense that in these rural communities, they know they have to look to the future for a variety of other opportunities to have family wage employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in our part of the world, we hope to have a very significant job-creating program to thin out the second row of trees. This is an opportunity to get merchantable timber to the mills but do it in a way that helps family wage employment and is good for the environment. We are going to have rural communities and folks from the forest product sector and environmental leaders supporting us in that effort. In the other body, a friend of the Presiding Officer and myself, Congressman Fazio,  has championed a similar effort. But to set in place these new programs such as thinning and biomass, where we can create clean energy from our forests, we are going to need a bit of time. That is why this multiyear program is so extraordinarily important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my view that the best opportunity we have had for some time to get county payments passed has come about because of the strong bipartisan work done in this Chamber to add county payments to the energy tax legislation. It is my hope, as we did when 74 Senators came together to support the original legislation I offered in this session, that, once again, we can get strong bipartisan support for county payments as part of the energy tax bill. If we can get it sent from the Senate in a timely  way to the other body, I think this time it will be possible to thread the needle, secure the funding for our rural communities, give them the opportunity to make the transition to these other areas that will allow them to strengthen their economy and particularly bring to our schools, to our law enforcement agencies the tools that are so desperately needed at this critical time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment No. 5276 to the National Defense Authorization Act, an amendment that would establish a government-wide Contingency Contracting Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through numerous hearings and investigations, the Senate Homeland Security Committee has documented many costly failures in contracting and acquisition management related to Federal operations following Hurricane Katrina and in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, other IGs, and the Government Accountability Office have also reported on serious problems in Federal contracting. Many of these well-documented problems might have been avoided or mitigated if  the government had a reserve cadre of skilled acquisition professionals who could be dispatched to areas in urgent need to assist with procurement and contract-management tasks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I introduced <bill type="s" number="680">S. 680</bill>, the Accountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007, with Senators LIEBERMAN, CARPER, COLEMAN, and MCCASKILL as original cosponsors. The Senate passed this bill unanimously last November 7, including a title that would establish a government-wide Contingency Contracting Corps. Unfortunately, House leaders have failed to take up our unanimously passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few days before the Senate action, the Army released the report of a special commission on procurement headed by former Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler. The Gansler Report noted that while contracting workload had increased by 350 percent since 1995, the Army's contract-oversight staff had declined by almost 50 percent. The report's recommendations for more people, better training, organizational reform, and other improvements offer us a case study of the challenges facing the  Federal acquisition process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"First and most important is the people," Dr. Gansler said while presenting his report. He was right, and that truth is at the core of the amendment that Senator Lieberman and I now offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for a Contingency Contracting Corps is urgent. The Federal Government purchases more than $440 billion of goods and services each year. Some of these purchases are pursuant to contracts issued under the stress and urgency of military operations or an emergency response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Purchasing on such a prodigious scale and across a vast array of departments and programs can create abundant opportunities for fraud, waste, and abuse. And doing so under the stress of military or disaster-recovery operations without sufficient staff skilled in working in those conditions can multiply the potential for trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our government moved into the 21st century with 22 percent fewer Federal civilian acquisition personnel than it had at the start of the 1990s. And as noted, the decline in the DOD acquisition workforce was even more pronounced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen that the urgent demands of natural disasters, a terrorist attack, or active military operations can overwhelm any agency's acquisition workforce. This amendment would provide the equivalent of a rapid-reaction force or strike team to ensure that emergency acquisition activities are performed swiftly, effectively, and economically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Corps would draw on volunteers from civilian and uniformed Federal-acquisition professionals. It would be managed by the OFPP Administrator. The Administrator would be authorized to prescribe additional training and determine when the Corps would be deployed. Any deployments would be made in consultation with the heads of the affected agencies, and in the case of military or civilian DOD employees, with the concurrence of the Defense Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Contingency Contracting Corps is not a substitute for the many other reforms needed to improve government-wide acquisition, but it can help our Nation deal with urgent demands by temporarily reallocating trained acquisition staff from their regular duties to areas of pressing need. The Corps would help guard against the wasteful and excessive spending that too often occurs in exigent circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to adopt this much-needed, carefully constructed, and bipartisan amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment No. 5277 to the National Defense Authorization Act, an amendment that will improve stewardship of taxpayer dollars while promoting more transparency and competition in the procurement of goods and services by our government. Senator Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joins me in sponsoring this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment, the Accountability in Government Contracting Act, is a bipartisan response to contracting problems identified by the Homeland Security Committee that pose increasing dangers of waste, fraud, and abuse as Federal contracting continues to grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment consists of provisions that passed the Senate unanimously last November as part of <bill type="s" number="680">S. 680</bill>. Many of that bill's provisions were included in last year's defense authorization. The remaining provisions are offered in this amendment, with modifications based on discussions with other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joining Senator Lieberman and me in this effort are Senators Coleman, Carper, Akaka, McCaskill, and Tester.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government purchases about $440 billion in goods and services each year. The rising costs of military operations, natural disasters, homeland security precautions, and other vital programs will drive those expenditures to even higher levels in the years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This prodigious level of purchasing creates abundant opportunities for fraud, waste, and abuse. We have seen far too many outrageous failures in government contracting, such as unusable trailers for hurricane victims, shoddy construction of schools and clinics in Afghanistan, or the installation in Iraq of showers for our troops that pose electric-shock hazards. All of these failures and more demand strong steps to protect taxpayer dollars and deliver better acquisition outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obstacles to improvement include personnel shortages, resource constraints, poor program administration, and inadequate accountability an transparency in the contracting process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resource challenges go far beyond funding, and start with a simple lack of trained personnel. The Federal Government moved into the 21st century with 22 percent fewer Federal civilian acquisition personnel than it had at the start of the 1990s. The Department of Defense, which has the largest acquisition budget, has been disbursing enormous amounts of money to contractors since the first Gulf war, but saw its acquisition workforce shrink by more than 50 percent between 1994 and 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the current, attenuated Federal acquisition workforce, nearly 40 percent were eligible to retire at the end of the last fiscal year. Meanwhile, the number and scale of federal purchases continue to rise, making this human-capital crisis even more dire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other challenges to fair, effective, and open competition and oversight include inadequate definition of requirements, overuse of letter contracts that fail to include all critical terms until after performance is complete, excessive tiering of subcontracts, and insufficient publicly available data on Federal contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment offers sensible, practical reforms to address these problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A critical feature of this legislation will help recruit, retain, and develop an adequate Federal acquisition workforce. It establishes an acquisition internship program that will provide professional training and development for careers in Federal procurement and acquisition management to at least 200 college graduates per year. Another provision would require that government chief acquisition officers have extensive management experience--a requirement lacking in current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment also promotes more competition for government contracts--a positive step for both contractors and taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competition for government contracts helps to control costs, encourage innovation, and improve quality. Unfortunately, the tide has been running the wrong way. While the dollar volume of Federal contracting has nearly doubled since the year 2000, fewer than half of all "contract actions"--new contracts and payments against existing contracts--are now subject to full and open competition, down from more than three-quarters in the year 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Homeland Security Committee investigations of federal contracting problems in the Hurricane Katrina disaster and in our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have confirmed the obvious concerns about this trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need more competition, less sole-source contracting, and tougher management of Federal contracts. Our amendment mandates enhanced competition for each task or delivery order over the simplified acquisition threshold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It further encourages competition for those orders by requiring Internet postings of notices of all sole-source task-or-delivery orders above the simplified acquisition threshold, within 14 business days after the award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision takes aim at abuse of interagency and enterprise-wide contracts, which account for 40 percent of Federal contract spending. It requires the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to survey, review, and provide guidance on procedures for creating, using, and continuing these interagency acquisitions. This step should eliminate some of the redundancies that have been discovered in these complex arrangements--redundancies that reduce the government's purchasing power and waste tax  dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I shall briefly note some other important provisions of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment will rein in the practice of hastily awarding letter contracts missing key terms, such as price, scope or schedule, and then failing to supply those terms until the contractor delivers the good or service--thereby placing all risk of failure on the government. In Iraq and Katrina contracting, we saw the perils of failing to supply the "missing term" promptly. For example, in July 2006, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction identified 194 individual task orders  valued at $3.4 billion that were classified as "undefinitized contract actions."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government has allowed too much money and too many contract actions to linger in this status. The amendment corrects this flaw by requiring clear guidance in the Federal  Acquisition Regulation and strong justification for making such contracts or orders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contracting for Hurricane Katrina and in Iraq has also involved excessive tiering of subcontractors, driving up costs and complicating contract administration. The amendment mandates regulatory guidance for minimizing tiering to ensure that every layer of subcontracting adds value or serves a valid purpose in meeting Federal requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our committee investigation of debris removal after Hurricane Katrina, a disaster that required clearing away nearly 100 million cubic yards of debris, we found that some contracts involved five or six tiers of subcontractors, often with little or no apparent added value. This provision would put in place government-wide requirements to control this practice and its potential for wasting tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important provision requires the OFPP to review and report on existing policies and to recommend needed changes to ensure that Federal agencies are not contracting out essential core responsibilities of government. The risks of such activity were made starkly clear in our committee's recent discovery that a contractor wrote parts of FEMA's request for proposals for the TOPOFF 5 emergency-management exercise and was then allowed to bid on the contract. This clear conflict of interest threatened  both the integrity of the competitive process and objective implementation of Federal policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also restricts the de-facto outsourcing of program-management responsibility when a large contractor becomes a "lead systems integrator" for a multipart project and requires the OFPP to craft a government-wide definition of lead systems integrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Accountability in Government Contracting Act combines practical, workable, and targeted reforms to improve a complex process that expends hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars every year. As the SIGIR said of these proposals in a Homeland Security Committee hearing last year, "these kinds of reforms are exactly what will save taxpayer dollars ... and address very directly the problems that we have been experiencing in contracting in Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment will pay recurring dividends for years to come in higher quality proposals, in avoidance of wasteful and excessive spending, and in better results for our citizens. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="COUNTY PAYMENTS REAUTHORIZATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of section 254 of the fiscal year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. I thank Chairman Levin and Senator JACK REED for working with me on this piece of legislation which is based on recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Defense. Critical technologies that help protect our national security are being outsourced to the global economy and to nations that may not have our best interests at heart.  One such technology is printed circuit boards, a type of electronics technology that is integrated into every weapons system we deploy, from the F-22 to UAVs to the MRAP. For years we relied on industry to maintain the technological advantage in this critical area, but we now must take more action to ensure that the United States maintains and protects this capability to better ensure our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to economic pressures, industry has increasingly outsourced the manufacture of printed circuit boards, and we are in danger of losing the industrial base capable of building and maintaining these components, especially those with critical security technologies required for our military. Without this critical technology, many components in numerous defense systems would cease to function. The Department of Defense spends roughly $500 million annually on procuring these components, and it is  imperative that we safeguard their future production. We cannot allow continued outsourcing to move production to China and other nations. We must protect our access to critical and sensitive pieces of hardware that are the basis of our military technological advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Previous Department of Defense efforts to address these issues have been incomplete, underfunded, and disjointed. It is critical that we establish an executive agent to monitor and protect issues related to the U.S. printed circuit board industry. Safeguarding the technology and manufacturing capabilities of printed circuit boards will protect our national interests today and in the future. Not only will this executive agent be instrumental in maintaining existing legacy systems but will also  ensure the military's advancement of emerging technologies are used in the next generation of military hardware. Failure to establish an executive agent and take aggressive action would result in the eventual loss of a critical technology and the diminishing capacity of our military's ability to safeguard our national security. Therefore, I urge support of section 254 and of the National Defense Authorization Act.</paragraph>
