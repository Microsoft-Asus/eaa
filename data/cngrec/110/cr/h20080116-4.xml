    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there's a certain irony: As the country is slipping towards recession, the Bush administration is backing away from its own study on infrastructure finance. The answer is simple. It's not a gimmick. Think of the subprime mess that got us into this situation in the first place. The solution is more money to invest. There are examples of where money may be available. For example, the carbon-constrained economy that we are moving into will create a great deal of value,  some of which could be captured to help pay for infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical, however, that we have a new vision of cleaning up the environment, rebuilding America, and making it more energy efficient, because people are not, nor should they put a lot of money into yesterday's plan. A new vision for investing in America in this century is a key, not just to fighting this temporary recession but making our communities more livable and making our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.</paragraph>
