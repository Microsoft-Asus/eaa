  <narrative>RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE IN MALAYSIA -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H393]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Malaysian Government recently seized  Christian children's books written in English because they contained illustrations of Bible prophets Moses and Abraham, an alleged violation of Islamic Shariah law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Malaysian Government's publications and "Religious Enforcement Police" found that the images of Bible characters in the Christian books offended the sensitivities of Muslims and must be banished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi indicated other religions must understand that Islam is the true religion for Malaysia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government's "midnight raid" on these books infringes on the basic human right of religious freedom, a right which ironically is protected in the Malaysian constitution, but nonexistent under Islamic Shariah law. This is yet another example of the problems with a State religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ghandi once said, "If we are to respect others' religions as we would have them respect ours, a study of the world's religions is a sacred duty." The Malaysian government expects all religions to be tolerant of the Islamic religion, but hypocritically is intolerant of the Christian faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
