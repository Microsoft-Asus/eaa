    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me for my side of the aisle describe what we have just done. Senator Reid and I have entered into an agreement, which I previously described to my conference, under which we will be able to smooth the passage of the supplemental appropriations bill into conference. The majority leader, with my concurrence, has filled up the tree and filed cloture. This should give us an opportunity Thursday afternoon on a broad bipartisan basis to move this  troop funding bill into conference where we will continue our discussions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader and I have had several meetings with the President's designee, Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and we will have additional meetings--as well as with House Democrats and Republicans--and hopefully achieve what I think we all want to achieve at this point, which is a signed troop funding bill before Memorial Day.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Republican leader and I have worked very closely in the past week or two on the process we are following this evening. We both agree it is imperative that we get to conference with the House as quickly as possible, and adoption of the Murray amendment, which is the amendment which was offered here, will allow us to do just that. This is a procedural step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are anxious to get to conference to work with the President's Chief of Staff Josh Bolten. He has been available any time we have asked for his presence. He realizes there is going to have to be some serious negotiations. We also understand that it is not just the Senate. The House has to be involved in these negotiations, and we  certainly understand that and Mr. Bolton understands that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a long way to go, but this was a tremendous step forward. We may disagree on a lot of issues dealing with the policy in Iraq, but the one point on which we agree--both Democrats and Republicans--is that the troops must have everything they need and more, and we are going to make sure that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican leader and I agree, and I have spoken with the Speaker of the House at 5 o'clock today, and she agrees with me, that we are going to finish this bill and this conference report prior to our leaving for the Memorial Day recess. Everyone should rest assured we are going to do that. I hope we can do that without causing a lot of discomfort to Senators and Members of the House if we finish this bill at a reasonable time a week from Thursday or Friday, but if we can't, we are going  no place until we finish this legislation and it gets to the President's desk.</paragraph>
