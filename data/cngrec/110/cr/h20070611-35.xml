    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to honor John Bach, a pillar of our law enforcement community, and a recent retiree from the Kenton County Sheriff's Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bach's career is one that embodies dedication and service to this country. From 1966 to 1970, he served with the 777th Tactical Air Squadron based out of Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, and was also part of the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron in southeast Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing his military service, John pursued a degree in business that he completed at Northern Kentucky University. John was quick to answer the call to service in our community. Throughout his career in law enforcement, he protected our communities in the line of duty at the Elsmere Police Department, the Boone County Police Department, the Independence Police Department and the Kenton County Sheriff's Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank John for his brave service to our Nation and for helping to make the communities of northern Kentucky safer for all of our residents as part of local law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to wish John and his wife, Linda, all the best as they enter this new chapter of their lives.</paragraph>
