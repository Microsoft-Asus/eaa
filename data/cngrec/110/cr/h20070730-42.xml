    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on June 6, 2007, in Anaheim, California, the Anaheim Ducks won the National Hockey League Stanley Cup. They won with a 6-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators in the decisive fifth game of the championship series. The Ottawa Senators were worthy opponents and should be congratulated for a hard-fought Stanley Cup series. The Ducks' win marked their first Stanley Cup title in franchise history and by a team from the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join all my colleagues in congratulating the National Hockey League Champions, the Anaheim Ducks, on their victory in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Rep. Loretta Sanchez for seeking to congratulate the Anaheim Ducks as the National Hockey League Champions and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in jubilant support of <bill type="hr" number="471">H. Res. 471</bill>, recognizing the Anaheim Ducks and their victory over the Ottawa Senators in the National Hockey League Stanley Cup Finals. I applaud the House's consideration of this exciting measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ottawa Senators proved to be worthy opponents, but they were no match for the hard hitting, exciting brand of hockey of Ducks general manager Brian Burke and head coach Randy Carlyle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 6-2 win to clinch the title was a display of solid teamwork as five different Ducks scored goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ducks teamwork was buttressed by the awe inspiring defensive work of Scott Niedermayer, who was honored as the most valuable player of the NHL post-season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their work is a true accomplishment. Not only did the Anaheim Ducks bring the Stanley Cup to Anaheim for the first time, but they are the first team from California to win it all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, we congratulate the Anaheim Ducks for their marvelous play and celebrate their victory in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
