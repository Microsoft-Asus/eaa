    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>) to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as amended.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, the Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act, was authored by my good friend from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman), and we appreciate his efforts over many years on behalf of our veterans. I was glad that we could get this bill to the floor today. It is the last of seven that say thank you to our Nation's veterans as we come up on Memorial Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would extend vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to members of the Armed Forces who are  determined to have a disability incurred while on active duty of at least 10 percent and likely to be discharged from service due to that disability. The servicemembers would still have to qualify under usual vocational rehabilitation and employment criteria of at least 20 percent, with an employment handicap of 10 percent with a serious employment  handicap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill> will help veterans begin their rehab earlier and will be very beneficial to those veterans in extended convalescence which could be over a year. This is the ideal time, as veterans will still be on active duty, continuing to receive their military pay, making it easier to support his or her family. One of the factors that leads to servicemembers dropping out of vocational rehabilitation and employment is the need to support their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the severity of the injury or injuries, most veterans will be expected to experience a drop in pay once they are discharged. However, if a veteran begins their rehab immediately, they may be able to enter the job market much earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>. It is an important bill. This is the least we can do for these brave men and women. It will ease the transition from the military to civilian employment market. And, again, I thank Mr. Boozman for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>, the Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act, implements a commonsense involvement in the speed with which we provide vocational rehabilitation to injured servicemembers. This bill makes it clear that active duty servicemembers are entitled to begin using vocational rehabilitation benefits prior to discharge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to coordinate with the military services to determine the likelihood that a servicemember undergoing hospitalization or outpatient treatment will be discharged or returned to active duty. If the member is likely to be discharged and will likely have a disability rating of at least 10 percent, VA is authorized to evaluate and award the full range of vocational rehabilitation benefits prior to the servicemember's discharge. Such a decision  would be made using the current statutory and regulatory processes to determine eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense to delay access to benefits that will speed an injured servicemember's return to productive civilian life. For severely injured servicemembers, these benefits often make the difference between whether or not they are able to live independently. Many of those wounded in the global war on terror spend 2 or 3 years recovering from their injuries and often find themselves with significant free time outside of their therapy sessions. That free time offers an ideal  opportunity to make use of their vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to prepare them for the civilian job market. I am happy to let my colleagues know that CBO has said that this bill "would have no direct impact on direct spending." The bill simply affects the timing of when our servicemembers receive the benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us have gone over to Bethesda and Walter Reed to visit injured troops. And, again, this is an effort to give them the best of both worlds, the best that we can offer them being on active duty, but to go ahead and start those vocational rehab services so that we can get vocational counselors in there and then, again, as they pursue their getting stronger and heal physically, to go ahead and direct them in such a way that we can provide a new occupation for them in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin, and especially the chairwoman in the sense that she was instrumental in helping us amend the bill to improve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I would urge that my colleagues support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the dynamic chair of our Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth Sandlin).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>, the Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the ranking member of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, my good friend and trusted colleague, Mr. Boozman, for introducing this important bill and for working with me prior to the committee markup to strengthen the bill. I also want to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their support of the bill as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While current law requires servicemembers to be discharged from active duty prior to applying and receiving benefits from the VA, <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill> would extend vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who are determined to have a disability of at least 10 percent or more, incurred or aggravated while on duty, and likely to be discharged from service due to that disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation would help veterans begin their rehabilitation earlier and could be very beneficial for those who are in extended convalescence, which may last more than a year for some servicemembers. As the chairman explained, today we do find that a major factor for new veterans dropping out of the VR&amp;E program is the immediate need to financially support the family. We can reduce the risk of these individuals dropping out of the program prematurely if we extend the benefits  while they are still on active duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in some cases, due to the severity of their injuries, a number of veterans may likely experience a drop in pay after their discharge and when they enter the civilian workforce. However, if a veteran begins his or her rehabilitation immediately, he or she may be able to enter the job market much earlier with a level of readiness and a set of skills to command a higher-paying position than otherwise might be obtained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work in a bipartisan manner with Mr. Boozman on the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee to ensure Federal services are available to help our fighting men and women successfully transition to civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill> so that we may ensure our servicemembers are more readily afforded the benefits they need to heal and succeed after their service to our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. BUYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill and compliment Ms. Herseth Sandlin for her work and Mr. Boozman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill, as amended does two important things. First, it lowers the existing eligibility for servicemembers undergoing treatment prior to discharge to 10 percent vice the current 20 percent. Second, it clarifies existing law to reaffirm Congress' intent that VA provide vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to eligible service members undergoing what is normally long-term convalescence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will be especially important to service members being treated at our major trauma centers such as Walter Reed, Bethesda, Palo Alto and Tampa Bay. Many of these service members are facing what may be years of physical and emotional therapy and it makes good sense to begin the process of reintegration into the workforce prior to discharge from active duty. Voc rehab benefits available under this bill will also provide positive reinforcement to DoD and VA therapy sessions by concentrating  on issues other than any residual disability(s) they may have from their injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent bill and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to urge the passage of <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>. I appreciate the work of my chairman and ranking member and especially the work of the staff on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on both <bill type="h" number="2199">H.R. 2199</bill> and <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have come to the end of a day of thanks to our Nation's veterans. We have seven bills, all of which will go to really improve our services, our health care, our sense of commitment to our Nation's veterans. We have had seven good bills today, and I think they will all be approved by this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a professor of European history before I became a Congressman, and I used to talk about the Roman world. And there was this famous Roman senator named Cato. And Cato would end all his speeches, no matter on what subject, which they might be about the sewer system of Rome or they might be about gladiator games or war against the Parthians or whoever, but he would always end his speech, no matter what the thing was, and everybody would expect it and he sort of became the laughingstock of  the senate because they would know he would end all his speeches with "and we must destroy Carthage." And nobody paid any attention to his speeches because they were all waiting for that conclusion no matter on what subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that little history lesson, I urge my colleagues to unanimously support <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise again today in support of <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>, the Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, vocational rehabilitation benefits provided by the VA are not available to veterans until after they have been discharged from military service. This bill extends eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits to current members of the armed forces who are hospitalized or are undergoing out-patient medical care, who have a disability of at least 10 percent incurred or aggravated while on active duty, and who are likely to be discharged from service due to that disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am dedicated to providing our Nation's veterans with every service that they have earned and that they were promised. Access to vocational rehabilitation is part of what our Nation's heroes are entitled to, and this bill is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By supporting this bill, we are ensuring that wounded servicemembers can access rehabilitational benefits more quickly without having to wait for their paperwork to catch up to them. This bill will get our wounded vets back on their feet and reintegrated into the workforce sooner than is currently possible by providing them with vocational benefits while they are awaiting military discharge. Reintegration into the workforce is a key part of easing stability back into the lives of our servicemembers  who have often spent months in incredibly tense and mentally-exhausting environments. Re-establishing a "normal" working routine at a pace that better suits our servicemembers is beneficial to all parties involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill> because the bill provides our Nation's veterans with more timely access to a promised service as they transition back to civilian life.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>, to expand eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I would like to take some of my time to express my deepest appreciation for our Nation's veterans. It is with this that I strongly ask you to expand eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits for all of our veterans. Every day, we find more and more of our veterans returning home with severe physical  and mental disabilities. This legislation is a step in the right direction and will act as a cornerstone necessity for providing the medical care, services and treatment that all of our country's finest deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress to must ensure that our injured soldiers, sailors, airmen and any other veterans who have returned home with a disability not only receive the basics in terms of medical attention, but also receive proper rehabilitation so that suitable employment in the future can become a viable option. The act of a person once again living independently is the highest goal that this legislation can achieve. Services that provide counseling, education, financial aid, and job assistance are the  best tools for our veterans to use in order to get back on their feet and live a life of independence and dignity. Let us not revisit the fatal mistakes made after Vietnam. To quote my good friend and colleague, DICK DURBIN, "We owe our disabled veterans more than speeches, parades and monuments." Let's do our best to convey our appreciation for their sacrifices.</paragraph>
