  <narrative>THE MEANING OF THE RESTORE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11852]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we listen to the comments of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is obvious that what they intend to do is to make this "SCHIP Week" and "SCHIP Month." You kind of wonder why they are doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reflect back on last week when we had a most important vote scheduled for this floor that somehow was removed. It was called the FISA vote. It is the question of how we enable ourselves to protect us and our children and our grandchildren against the attacks of those who are terrorists around the world. We do it in many ways, but absolutely essential is intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the FISA bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, would have been destroyed by the bill placed on the floor last week by the majority, the so-called RESTORE Act. It actually gave greater protection to Osama bin Laden in a telephone conversation than an American citizen in the United States accused of a crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>RESTORE: What does it mean? Repeal Effective Surveillance Techniques Opposing Real Enemies. Go out to NSA and see what they are doing. Understand what we need to do in this country and then bring a bill back to this floor that restores the ability of the United States to find out about our enemies before they attack.</paragraph>
