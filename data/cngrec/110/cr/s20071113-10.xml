  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this point, I will respond to my friend from Kentucky, the distinguished Republican leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have something new in town that has been going on now for almost 11 months, and that is we are paying for things. That is the reason the Clinton economic machine worked as well as it did. When we had a new program, we paid for it. When taxes were decreased, we paid for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to go ahead and do the AMT fix, but we are going to do it by paying for it. We cannot continually run this country in the red. I repeat what I have said on a number of other occasions. When President Bush took office 7 years ago, we had a $7 trillion surplus over 10 years. He has driven us into near bankruptcy as a result of his fiscal irresponsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are responsible. We are going to fix AMT before the end of the year, but we will do it the right way; we are going to pay for it.</paragraph>
