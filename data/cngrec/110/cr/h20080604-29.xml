    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3712">H.R. 3712</bill> as amended is a bill to designate the Federal building located at 1716 Spielbusch Avenue in Toledo, Ohio, as the "James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The late Congressman and Governor James M. Ashley and former Congressman Thomas W.L. Ashley served their Ohio constituents for over 30 years as Members of Congress and Governor. The Ashley family has served with distinction in public service for a span of almost 100 years in the state of Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Monroe Ashley served five terms as a Republican Congressman from Ohio. Governor Ashley's best known Congressional achievement was as the primary sponsor of the resolution which is recognized as the antecedent of the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery within the United States and its territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Congress, James Ashley also became the chair of the House Committee on Territories, leading the congressional effort to organize Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, and Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chair of the House Committee on Territories, he wrote the enabling act for Nebraska, Colorado, and Nevada on which he conditioned that a separate vote be held by these potential member States that would prevent them from establishing slavery without the consent and approval of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this measure, Ashley, an avowed abolitionist, signaled that no new slave States would be admitted to the Union. After serving in Congress, James M. Ashley was appointed Governor of Montana in 1869 by President Ulysses S. Grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was the great-grandson of former Governor and Congressman James M. Ashley. Congressman Thomas Ashley served in the United States Army during the Second World War. He went on to graduate first from Yale University in 1948 and from the Ohio State University Law School in 1951.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Ashley later held several positions as a private lawyer and a member of the media. In 1954 Congressman Ashley was elected as a Democrat to Congress and went on to serve a total of 13 terms in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Congress, Congressman Ashley served as chairman of the Select Committee on Energy and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Ashley also served as the assistant majority whip for the Democratic Party. Congressman Ashley's most prominent legislative success was PL 89-117 which directed the Federal Government to assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This law was the precursor to the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development which was created later in that same Congress. After leaving Congress in 1981, Ashley went on to found a legal and consulting firm in Washington, DC. Congressman Thomas W.L. Ashley currently resides in the Washington, DC area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Monroe Ashley and Thomas William Ludlow Ashley will be remembered as distinguished public servants to the great State of Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ashley family served as leaders in both the Democratic and Republican Party in Ohio and each served their party well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They will be respected as great Americans whose dedication to public service was passed down through the generations. As such, it is very appropriate that the United States Courthouse in Toledo, Ohio, be designated as the "James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley United States Courthouse".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for as much time as she may consume.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise today and ask my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="3712">H.R. 3712</bill>, which seeks to name the Federal Courthouse Building located in Toledo Ohio, the James M. Ashley and Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley Customs Building and United States Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This deserved recognition of two well-known lawmakers from the Ashley family, whose roots run deep in America and our community, pays tribute to the lives of late Congressman and Governor James M. Ashley who served here in the 19th century, as well as his great-grandson, former Congressman Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley, who served here during the 20th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These visionary Americans who lived in three different centuries advanced America's promise and the cause of social justice as they made immeasurable public service contributions to both define and direct the course of our Nation, one in the abolitionist fight to eliminate slavery in our Nation, and the other to bind up America's wounds in the civil rights era to help our Nation gain its idealistic foothold again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman James Ashley, who served in our U.S. House of Representatives from December 1859 to March 1869, was an active abolitionist credited with introducing the first bill for the 13th Amendment to our constitution to abolish the practice of slavery. He also drafted a bill to abolish slavery in Washington, DC. These extraordinarily brave actions in his era are illustrative of Ashley's courageous leadership. They reflect the Ashley family's place in history on the scales of justice and equality  for all people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure in Congress, James Ashley served as chairman of the Committee on Territories, and he was later appointed Governor of Montana. Congressman Thomas Ludlow Ashley, great-grandson of James Ashley from Lucas County, Toledo, Ohio, served a quarter century, 13 terms, from January 1955 to January 1981. During his tenure, he served as the chairman of the Select Committee on Energy where he was chosen by then-Speaker Thomas Tip O'Neill to prepare comprehensive legislative proposals across  congressional committees to regain America's energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During that era of the 1970s, that landmark legislation, the Energy Conservation Act of 1976, and subsequent Carter administration energy independence proposals became America's first step on an arduous journey into a new energy age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also served as chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marines and Fisheries and as assistant majority whip for the Democrats in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lud was an outstanding leader in both community development and energy policy. As Chair of the Housing and Community Development Subcommittee for the Banking Committee, he, like his great-grandfather before him, championed social justice. He wrote and gained passage of the Demonstration City Act and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and 1977 to rebuild America's cities and communities in the wake of the civil rights era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the very establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Lyndon Johnson administration was made possible by Lud's effective and dogged congressional leadership. Housing for the less fortunate and more sustainable communities across our country were made possible through his unyielding and creative efforts. A banker's banker, he also gained passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, the Export Development Administration Act of 1969, the Export Expansion and Finance  Act of 1971.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A World War II hero, Congressman Ashley also served in the U.S. Army prior to his service in the U.S. House. Subsequent to his career in Congress, Congressman Ashley founded a consulting firm in Washington, DC, and now resides in Traverse City, Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my colleagues to please join me in supporting this bill in honor of two centuries of a family's service to America by the Ashley family and their two outstanding sons whose commitment to America is historic. Ohio is proud to claim these two favorite sons, men of principle, as people who changed America for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my dear colleague from Texas, Congresswoman Johnson for yielding to me. I thank Congressman Kuhl, and I thank the leadership here for allowing us from the proud Buckeye State of Ohio to place the Ashley family's name on our revered Federal courthouse in perpetuity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the resolution offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio, Representative Kaptur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3712">H.R. 3712</bill> designates the Federal building and United States courthouse located in Toledo, Ohio as the "James M. Ashley and Thomas W. L. Ashley Customs Building and United States Courthouse."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Mitchell Ashley was an Ohio congressman who served five terms in the United States Congress where he served for 8 years as the chairman on the Committee of Territories. Representative Ashley had a prominent role in the passage of the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery. Following his service in Congress, James Ashley served as the Governor of the Territory of Montana, as you have previously heard, and helped to construct the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern Railroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His great grandson, Thomas William Ludlow Ashley, also served as a congressman from Ohio from 1955 to 1981, some 26 years. Representative Thomas Ashley served 13 terms in Congress, and was chairman of the Select Committee on Energy in the 95th Congress. Prior to his service, he served in the Pacific theater during World War II as a corporal in the United States Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a fitting tribute to their service and to their country. I support this measure, and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this legislation will name a courthouse in Ohio, it is not on the issue or not on the minds of people across the country as they travel to work. They are more worried about the cost of filling up their gas tanks than they are the managerial actions of Congress' naming a building after some very honorable people. The American people are really feeling the pain at the pump, and this Congress has ignored their calls for help. It seems that, every night, the news media proclaims that the gas  prices have hit another record high. As Congress idles and as prices soar, the problem is being ignored. This is something that Congress must act on immediately.</paragraph>

Ashley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ashley family has a distinguished record in public service dating back to the mid 1800s. Various members of this family have served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1858.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Monroe Ashley, 1824-1896, served five terms as a Representative from Ohio. During the American Civil War, Congressman Ashley was the first Representative to call for an amendment to the United States Constitution to outlaw slavery. The amendment he sponsored served as the antecedent to the thirteenth amendment of the Constitution, which abolished slavery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas William Ludlow Ashley is the great-grandson of former Governor and Congressman, James M. Ashley. In 1954, Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was elected to Congress served a total of 13 terms in Congress.

"Tip" O'Neill established a Select Committee on Energy and appointed Congressman  Ashley  to chair the Committee, which compiled energy legislation based on bills reported by several House committees in response to President Jimmy Carter's legislative proposal.</paragraph>
