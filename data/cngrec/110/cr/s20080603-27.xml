    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate the 2008 recipients of the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Awards. These prestigious awards, commonly called the "ED"ies, are presented each year to individuals and schools who demonstrate the highest level of excellence in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "ED"ies were instituted as a way to honor the best of the best among New Hampshire's educators. For 15 years, annual award winners have been drawn from a rich source of talented and successful teachers, administrators, schools, and school boards. This year's recipients are no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those individuals selected have been compared against a criteria set by others in their discipline through their sponsoring organization. Schools are chosen by experienced educators and community leaders in New Hampshire based on guidelines established by the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Board of Directors. I am proud to recognize the individuals and schools who will receive this honor on June 7, 2008, and look forward to personally presenting this year's award for Secondary School of  Excellence to Londonderry High School, as well as the Presidential Awards for Math and Science to Kimberly Knighton of Profile School and Louis Broad of Timberlane High School, respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a graduate of Salem High School, I am especially pleased that this year's New Hampshire Teacher of the Year, Benjamin Adams, has taught in Salem for 12 years. As I serve in the United States Senate, I am grateful for the excellent education I received in our New Hampshire public schools, and congratulate all of this year's award winners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that the list of the 2008 New Hampshire Excellence in Education Award winners be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
