  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 79 days and counting since President Bush committed his request for critical funding needed for our troops fighting on the front lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic leadership should bring the emergency supplemental to the floor without a timetable of defeat. It's not a decision of this House to arbitrarily pick a date this war should end. It's our job to ensure our military personnel have the resources they need to win and come home in victory. I wonder what men and women risking their lives every day for our safety, our security, our freedom, think about the Members of Congress sitting in their comfortable offices, playing politics with  their money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to the House floor this morning to speak to them and let them know there are Members of Congress who believe our military can succeed, and we are doing everything within our power to ensure victory. As long as I am United States Congressman, I will never turn my back on you. I will not stand in Washington, D.C., and tell your generals how to fight this war, and will never put politics above your safety or that of our Nation.</paragraph>
