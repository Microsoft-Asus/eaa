    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="637">H. Res. 637</bill> provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration and considers the conference report as read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today in support of this rule and this much-needed underlying conference report, the College Cost Reduction Act, which will help give our students a real opportunity to go to college and give them the vital tools necessary to enter our workforce and build a positive future for themselves and our communities. And, Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to thank Representative George Miller, the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, along  with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, whose commitment to our students, our families and our future in this country has brought us to this day when we are able to take this great step to put college education back within reach of so many hardworking families and students. The College Cost Reduction Act addresses one of the most pressing issues facing millions of families across this Nation: the question of how they will afford to send their children to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Educational opportunity is the backbone of our Nation and everything that makes it great. And while access to higher education is more critical than ever for younger generations, the cost is rapidly moving out of reach for many low- and middle-income families. Tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities has risen 41 percent after inflation since 2001. And the typical American student now graduates from college with a $17,500 debt. This problem has developed into nothing less than a crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, due to the failure of past Congresses, many students have had their dreams shattered because they could not afford college tuition. Many hardworking parents have had their hearts broken because, despite their valiant efforts, they simply could not afford to pay tuition and meet other vital family needs. This problem has festered for too long, and I have long believed, Mr. Speaker, that those in government must work with the people they are called to serve and not against them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is what this bill does. It is the single largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill. It's good for our families. It's good for our students. It's good for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Financial barriers to higher education not only hurt students themselves by robbing them of the education and training necessary to make a productive and positive impact in our communities; it hurts us all. Investing in our students will not only improve their future; it will help our economy and our retired workers whom they will support. It ensures our national security, continued improvements in health outcomes, and will help the United States maintain its role as a leader in developing new  cutting-edge technologies. By providing students with access to higher education, we are bolstering every sector of our economy from medical research to manufacturing because we are creating the next generation of innovators and leaders. Investing in our younger generations will not only help our students and families who are need; it strengthens America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The promise of the American Dream is the glue that holds our communities together. It was educational opportunity that provided me, the proud daughter of a working family, to obtain a first-rate education and ultimately find my way to the floor of the House of Representatives to fight for what is right. By denying the opportunities afforded by access to higher education, we deny our families their share of the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act addresses this crisis in a fiscally sound and responsible manner. It is funded by cutting unnecessary subsidies to private lenders and putting our taxpayer dollars to work for the American people. So, Mr. Speaker, this act will not only put college back in reach for our families; it does so by cutting almost $21 billion in taxpayer subsidies to private lenders and reinvesting over $20 billion of the savings in our Nation's students and putting an additional $750  million towards reducing our Nation's deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the College Cost Reduction Act will cut the interest rates on subsidized student loans in half. The bill invests heavily in the much-needed, need-based Pell Grant scholarship program, increasing the maximum award by at least $1,090 over the next 5 years and expanding eligibility for the grants. By passing this bill, we will make a college education possible for hundreds of thousands of additional students over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation also recognizes the value of our public servants by providing them with loan forgiveness for those who choose to serve in the jobs that make our world turn: teachers, firefighters, nurses, law enforcement officers, and librarians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the College Cost Reduction Act provides upfront tuition assistance to qualified undergraduates who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities. This bill invests in the strength of our communities and of our country. And the return on our investment as a Nation in our students and people will, without question, provide an enormous return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the crisis of college cost is pervasive, and it is getting worse. It is long past the time that Congress take action to ensure that a college education is not a privilege reserved only for the wealthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support our children and our families by voting for the rule and the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for the time; and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule that the majority brings forth today, Mr. Speaker, is a standard  rule for a conference report. But yesterday the minority on the Rules Committee voted against this rule because of the unsatisfactory manner in which the conference report was put together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his submitted testimony to the Rules Committee yesterday, Education and Labor Committee Ranking Member BUCK McKeon expressed concern with the process the majority used of the conference committee. The minority was informed at 9:30 p.m. that the conference committee would meet at 11:30 a.m. the following morning. However, the majority did not provide the minority with the text of the conference report at the time the meeting was announced and even kept the text away from Republicans  at the meeting itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican conferees were, in effect, left in the dark. They had no way to know what was in the report. As such, it was impossible for members of the minority to propose amendments to the report and thus play any meaningful part in the conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats did not even allow Republicans to see the conference report at the end of the meeting. Instead, Republicans had to wait until later in the evening hours after the conference committee had ended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle campaigned, and they did so repeatedly, on an open, fair, and bipartisan process, including a promise to provide members of conference committees with texts of conference reports. They also said that they will allow members of the conference committee to vote on all amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During consideration of the rules package for this new Congress, the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee said, "Never again will any Member of the Congress have to fight to find out where the conference to which he or she has been appointed is meeting."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, in this instance, Members did not have to fight to find the conference committee location, but they certainly did have to fight to get the text of the conference report; and even after fighting, they did not get to see it. By keeping the text of the conference report away from the minority, Democrats were essentially locking out Republican Members from the conference committee, which is exactly what the Democrats said they would not do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, because of the manner, the way the majority kept the text of the conference report from Republicans and thus committed, if you will, a process foul, we oppose this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman, the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee from California (Mr. George Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule to make in order the conference report on <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this last election, we campaigned very hard on cutting the cost of college for students and making college more affordable for students and their families who are borrowing money to go to school. And it is clear that we intend to do that with the passage of this legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first 10 hours as part of our 6 for '06 agenda, we cut the interest rates in half on the subsidized student loans so that those low-income families and middle-income families who are struggling to meet the debt burden of sending their children to school will have some relief in that effort. And over the next 4 years in this conference report, we will cut those interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, which is a savings of the average indebted student upon graduation over the life  of that loan of some $4,400. Also for the lowest-income students, the students most in need, we are increasing the Pell Grant up to a level over the next 5 years of $5,400. This is in keeping with what the President promised but never did, and this is in keeping with our promise that we would again restore the purchasing value of the Pell Grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you can see from this chart, Mr. Speaker, the fact is over the last several years, the Pell Grant has been flat-lined in spite of promises each and every year that it was going to be increased; and this year for the first time Mr. Obey put money in, in the continuing resolution in the appropriations bill, and then this bill will continue to raise the Pell Grant to $5,400. This is the largest increase, certainly, in recent history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that these two populations, middle-income students and families and low-income students and families, have these resources available to them. And the reason it is important is we are now seeing increasing reports now estimated at more than a quarter of a million students who are fully qualified to go to school every year choose not to go to college, to postpone it, or not to go at all because they are worried about whether or not they will be able to manage the debt or afford  the cost of college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And it is our job to make sure that no student in America that is fully qualified to go to college is refused the opportunity to do so because of the cost of college. That has been the policy of this country since the GI Bill, and this is the largest investment since the GI Bill 50 years ago. But it was a policy of the Eisenhower administration, of the Kennedy administration, and essentially every administration on a bipartisan basis since then. But we now see college costs far outstripping the  ability of families to pay for a college education, therefore requiring them to borrow money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in this legislation we take $20 billion away from the large lenders and other lenders of college loans, excessive subsidies that were paid for them, excessive subsidies that were identified in the President's legislation, and we recycle those monies to the benefit of the students and to their families, and we do so within pay-as-you-go, that each and every expenditure in this bill is paid for by the recycling of those excessive subsidies that were going to the lending institution. And in that  way, we're able to deliver real money to these families in need in the form of a reduction in interest rates, in the form of an increase in the Pell Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also do that so that those people who want to choose the profession of a policeman, a nurse, a fireman, a teacher, a special educator, a prosecutor, a public defender, that those individuals will be allowed to choose those careers and know that they will not have to make another choice because of the crushing debt of their college education. They, under this legislation, will not be required to pay any more than 15 percent of their income in any given year for these student loans. And  what does that mean? That means they can start a career in nursing, in health care, in law enforcement, as a first responder, and they know that if they stay in that field for 10 years, that loan will be forgiven. That is a major advantage to those individuals who are seeking to go into those fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also want to keep the promise of earlier actions in this Congress when we passed the COMPETES Act to have highly qualified teachers in math and science go into the classrooms. We're saying to those exemplary performers in college that if you'll go into teaching and you'll go into the most difficult schools, we will give you $4,000 a year up front while you're in school of tuition relief if you will agree to do that; 16,000 real dollars to those people because they're going to go in and teach  in the most difficult schools, and the exemplary performers are going to have the skills and the talents to do that if they so choose to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the foundation of the cornerstone of our agenda on innovation for new discovery of this Nation, the next generation of discovery, of innovation, of economic growth and jobs here in America. This is the most valuable investment we can make. Every economist will tell you that the investment in education yields more back to the government, more back to the public sector, more back to civil society than any other investment we make. And that's what we're doing in this legislation.  We promised we would do it. We started out in "six for '06," and today, with this conference report, the House and the Senate is keeping its promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've made changes in this legislation that were suggested by Mr. McKeon and by the administration. And I am proud to announce that the President, in spite of his suggested veto messages or his staff-suggested veto messages over the last couple of  months, the President has agreed to sign this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of my colleagues to join in support of this rule and to support the conference report when it comes before us. I hope that we will have a good bipartisan vote as they're now having in the Senate at this very moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for her support in this effort and for yielding the time.</paragraph>

  <chair> Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from California, the ranking member of the committee, Mr. McKeon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. This rule would provide for consideration of fiscally irresponsible legislation that would create costly new entitlement programs and misdirect billions of aid toward colleges, universities, college graduates and philanthropic organizations rather than the low-income students who need the help the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues who were around in the last Congress may remember that when we passed a real budget reconciliation bill, the Education and Workforce Committee found some $18 billion plus in savings, two-thirds of which we directed towards deficit reduction and one-third of which we directed towards increased student benefits such as higher loan limits, more grant aid for low-income, high-achieving students, and loan forgiveness for high-demand teachers. Unfortunately, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the bill that will  be before us today, takes us in a drastically different direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule before us provides for the culmination of months of abuse of the budget reconciliation process as a backdoor way to implement significant changes to programs best addressed through regular order. Not a single committee hearing has been held on this legislation. The potential impact of many of its student loan cuts has never been weighed, and no one has provided adequate reasons regarding why the new entitlement programs and complex student loan auction scheme created under the conference  report are necessary or fiscally reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It eliminates the right of parents to choose their lender and replaces consumer choice with a government-run auction system that is complex, burdensome and untested. And all of this will be put into place in a couple of weeks time. I'm anxious to see how the department puts this into place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure could have been improved by infusing more savings into the Pell Grant Program. Pell is a proven success that has helped millions of young people attend college. In the time during the last 12 years that we were in charge, we have increased Pell Grant spending double. As the chairman just pointed out, the amount of what he talked about, the individual aid to each individual student, has remained fairly even, but the amount that we have put in has been increased like a billion dollars  a year over that period of time because we have a million and a half more students that have now been able to take advantage of that and use the money for their help in getting their chance to achieve the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By creating a bundle of new entitlement programs complete with new bureaucracy, rules, and regulations, this conference agreement places billions of dollars in new Federal spending on autopilot with no accountability to taxpayers whatsoever, completely opposite of what the real purpose of reconciliation is for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of reconciliation, requiring an easier passage by only requiring 50 votes in the Senate, was set up to reduce mandatory spending and to save money on the budget deficit. And this will actually increase and go just the opposite direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, let me be perfectly clear: I have absolutely no confidence in the Department of Education's ability to implement the changes outlined in this conference agreement, particularly with the timeline it sets. It gives me no pleasure to point out this obvious fact, particularly in a Republican administration, but it's true. And sadly, we will be watching this failure play out in the coming months and years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule allows consideration of a conference report that breaks promises to students and taxpayers alike. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the single largest investment in education since the GI Bill, and we know what the GI Bill did for the World War II generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, the American people lost 4,000 jobs under this administration, and foreclosures are rising. The middle class needs relief. And this bill will cut interest rates in half of subsidized student loans over the next 4 years. It will allow borrowers to be able to not pay more than 15 percent on their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Pell Grant, something that has helped low income, students, and what all of my students ask about every single time I visit college campuses, will be raised to $490, and over 5 years more than $1,000. And then we will invest in America's most underserved communities, Hispanic-serving, Historically Black, Native Americans and other institutions in which the bill will invest $510 million to help students stay in school among other incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation helps our students graduate. It encourages public service. This bill is worth all of us voting for it. The middle class of America needs relief. This is a giant step forward in educating all Americans.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to summarize in 1 minute the attributes of this first-rate conference report, but let me just say this: For a period of time before I came to the Congress, I was the senior administrator in a college. I had a very simple rule when I was faced with a decision. That rule was: Is the decision I'm about to make in the best interest of students, will it help students? And by that measure, the answer to this question is an emphatic "yes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be supporting the rule. We should be supporting the underlying legislation. This legislation helps students realize their dreams, and that's what this Congress should be about. This is about student aspiration, and this is about the Congress providing the resources to see to it that students can get their slice of the American Dream. And by increasing the Pell Grant maximum, by reducing the rate that students will have to pay when they borrow, and by streamlining the needs analysis  system so that students have a more realistic measure of their ability to pay, we will increase access, we will enhance affordability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should support this rule and support this conference report.</paragraph>
