  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas Mario R. Capecchi was born in Italy in 1937 and earned a PhD in biophysics from Harvard University in 1967;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Sir Martin J. Evans was born in Great Britain in 1941 and earned a PhD in anatomy and embryology from University College in London in 1969;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Oliver Smithies was born in Great Britain in 1925 and earned a PhD in biochemistry from Oxford University in 1951;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mario Capecchi currently serves as Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics and Biology at the University of Utah School of Medicine;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Sir Martin J. Evans currently serves as the Professor of Mammalian Genetics and Director of the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University in Wales;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Oliver Smithies currently serves as an Excellence Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mario R. Capecchi, Sir Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies have made a series of discoveries concerning embryonic stem cells and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) recombination in mammals that have led to the creation of gene targeting in mice, a powerful technology that is now being used in all areas of biomedicine;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas gene targeting technology has been used in experiments that have successfully isolated genes in order to determine their roles in embryonic development, adult physiology, aging, and disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas gene targeting has produced more than 500 different mouse models of human disorders, including cardiovascular and neuron degenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on October 8, 2007, Mario R. Capecchi, Sir Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries of principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) honors and recognizes the scientific work and achievements of Mario R. Capecchi, Sir Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies; and</chair>
  <chair> (2) congratulates Mario R. Capecchi, Sir Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies for their receipt of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</chair>
