  <narrative>FINAL OMNIBUS BILL IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16649]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last night this House acted in bipartisan fashion to reject some of the President's harmful budget cuts to important education programs. Had this Congress simply rubber-stamped President Bush's budget, education funding would have been slashed by $1.2 billion, including a 50 percent cut in vocational education and the elimination of every student aid program except Pell Grants and Work Study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House rejected those cuts. Instead, we invest $767 million more than the President's request for K-12 education, including targeted increases in special education, teacher quality grants, after-school programs and Head Start. We invested $575 million above the President's budget for technical training in high schools and community colleges. And we provide $1.7 billion more than the President for Pell Grants and other student aid programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this new Democratic Congress has prioritized the needs of children and young adults by investing in their education so they can better compete in an ever-expanding global economy.</paragraph>
