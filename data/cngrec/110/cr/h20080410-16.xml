    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it pains me greatly to stand here in the well and report to our colleagues that the Rules Committee late yesterday afternoon reported out what can only be described as the Hugo Chavez rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time in the 34-year history of trade promotion authority, we have now decided that we are going to take the action of turning our backs on an agreement that we have made with our closest, most important and strongest ally on the continent of South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vice President of Colombia has described this action as a slap in the face. Hugo Chavez and the narcoterrorists in Colombia are celebrating this action. It is an absolute outrage that we would do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say that this administration 4 years ago embarked on these negotiations, 2 years ago completed the negotiations, a year and a half ago signed the negotiations. Since August of last year, 265 meetings have been held with Democratic Members by members of the administration, cabinet officials and all, and 27 meetings have been held with the Democratic leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to complete this work. It's time for us to strengthen this very important alliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote "no" on the Hugo Chavez rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
