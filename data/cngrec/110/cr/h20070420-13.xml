  <speaking speaker="400328" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our troops in combat deserve to be sent the resources and reinforcements that they need to be successful in their mission in Iraq, without strings and without delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Putting in place an inflexible timeline that culminates with a date certain time for withdrawal micromanages our commanders in the field and undermines the efforts of our troops on the ground. The Washington Post describes the Democrat plan as "an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The L.A. Times called for the bill to be vetoed saying, "It's absurd to try and micromanage the conflict, and the evolution of Iraqi society, with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to stand up for our troops. Our troops deserve a clean bill, not one bulging with add-ons and political statements.</paragraph>
