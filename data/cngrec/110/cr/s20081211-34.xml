    <paragraph>Madam President, I will be very quick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I apologize that I did not say something a minute ago. We have had a difficult Congress. We have had the staff who are so valiant, so good, who always make us look as good as we can look. Sometimes that is not very good. However good we look, it is because of the great staff we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been through 95 filibusters this Congress. We have had many serious issues. Our country is in an economic meltdown. We had a series of important votes here. It seemed to never end. But always our staff is here--always. The Democratic staff on this side of the aisle, the Republican staff on the other side of the aisle, they are all very professional; the Parliamentarians, these wonderful pages, the court reporters. And, of course, the Capitol Police, these people--some of whom are in uniform,  some not--are here to protect us as well as all the staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want everyone to know, the four of you seated in front of the Presiding Officer, how much I appreciate the work you do. You are all very patient. You take abuse a lot of times that you should not because a lot of times we are busy and forget that we also have to be nice to everyone. If I have offended any of you over the past couple years, it certainly was not intentional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so grateful that my Democratic colleagues allow me to serve in the capacity I do, as amateurish as I am on occasion, but it is not because I am not trying. I have the greatest affection for every one of my Democratic Senators. They are always so good to me and work so hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to the next year. We need a productive year. Our country is in big trouble. We have so many things happening to us, individuals, that it does not matter where you look in America today, there is very little good news economically. And what happened today is not going to help that. But I talked about that before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate all that everyone does, including the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary. They do such good work. We have all the committee chairs who work so hard, subcommittee chairs. I have been fighting for some words to express myself how appreciative I am. I am not forthcoming of them, so I will say thank you all very much for what you do for us and, of course, the country.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from California is recognized.</chair>
