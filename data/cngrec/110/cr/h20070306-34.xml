    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="149">H. Res. 149</bill>) supporting the goals of International Women's Day.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I first want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) and the other cosponsors of this resolution for recognizing International Women's Day in honor of the contributions and achievements of women all over the world and the importance of promoting and protecting their rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to pay special tribute today to my distinguished female colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who are performing their important responsibilities with distinction and honor. I also want to recognize my distinguished colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who has achieved the distinction of becoming the first woman to obtain the ranking position on this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, women all over the world are becoming leaders in science, medicine, the arts, politics, business, and even the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this progress, women and girls continue to represent the majority of the poor, the chronically hungry, refugees, the HIV-infected, the sick, the uneducated and the undereducated, the unemployed and disenfranchised people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women are also subject to specific forms of physical and structural violence and discrimination because of their gender. These include sexual violence in both conflict and nonconflict situations, sex trafficking, and domestic violence from their partners and family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cruel cultural practices targeted at women include denial of voting rights, freedom of movement, and property rights. Women are also subjected to genital mutilation, forced and early marriages, humiliating and harmful  widow practices, bride burnings and honor killings. Women also continue to experience an unequal remuneration for work of equal value, discrimination in hiring and admission to educational institutions, and lack of flexibility for special  needs such as paid and extended family leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not enough to simply declare the equality of women, condemn their mistreatment, and increase the number of women in the workplace. We must, in all sectors of society, address the structural mechanisms which deny women and girls access to the same rights and opportunities as boys and men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We must also attack and eliminate the criminal and cultural practices which destroy the lives and freedom and the health of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statistics prove that when women are better off in our society, their children are happier, healthier and more educated, and our world is better off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will do everything in my power to ensure that every piece of legislation we consider in the committee will improve the security, opportunity and prosperity of women, and I know my colleagues will share this important goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of our wives, our mothers, our daughters, our female colleagues and our Speaker, and women around the world, I am proud to support this resolution, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Ambassador Watson for her eloquent statements and as well as for her leadership in our Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="149">H. Res. 149</bill>, supporting the goals of International Women's Day. International Women's Day has developed into a day of recognition and celebration of the contributions and social advancement of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the author of this resolution, Representative Schakowsky of Illinois, for accepting the suggested changes that we had to her base text prior to the introduction and committee consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These very modest clarifications emphasize that we are seeking to promote for women and girls the full and equal enjoyment of those fundamental human rights and civil liberties that are the birthright of all people, regardless of gender, race or creed, not some separate of gender-based claims or a problematic agenda related to abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must all advance the cause of human dignity by ending violence against women and girls, by protecting their fundamental freedoms and civil liberties, and promoting their genuine welfare through robust educational and economic opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the extent that International Women's Day serves those purposes, it deserves our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to render their full support to this important measure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the author of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me and for her great support for this measure, and I also thank Representative Ros-Lehtinen for her help for a long time making this resolution possible today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="149">H. Res. 149</bill>, the International Women's Day resolution. I want to also thank Representative Judy Biggert, who is the lead Republican sponsor, for her consistent support and work to bring this resolution to the House floor. We have introduced this resolution honoring women three times, and it has been a pleasure working with her over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, as the vice chair of the Women's Caucus, I am honored to have this resolution to be the first of our top five priority agenda items to make it to the House floor with such remarkable bipartisan support under the leadership of the chairwomen, Lois Capps and Cathy McMorris Rodgers. I appreciate their help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, countries around the world mark March 8 as International Women's Day as a day to recognize the contributions and the impact that women have made to our world's history, to recognize those women who have worked for gender equality and to acknowledge the work that is yet to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, women have made significant strides. Women all over the world and throughout history have consistently contributed to their economies, participated in their governments and improved the quality of life of their families and their Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi became the first woman in the history of the United States to be Speaker of the House. In 2006, I attended the inauguration of Michelle Bachelet, the first woman President of Chile, and visited in Liberia its President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman President in Africa's history. In the 110th Congress, we have an all-time high of 74 women in Congress, a 35 percent increase from just 8 years ago. However, women still make up only 16 percent  of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the United States, we have made significant strides in education. In fact, women now graduate from high school at higher rates and earn bachelor's or higher degrees at greater rates than men. While that is true, yet two-thirds of the 876 million illiterate individuals in the world are women. That is, two-thirds of them are women. Two-thirds of the 125 million school-aged children who are not attending school worldwide are girls, and girls are less likely to complete school than boys elsewhere  around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women are making progress in business, and women make up 11 of the current CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. However, more progress still needs to be made. While great strides have been made in business, women still earn less, own less and have less access to education and employment than men. Globally, while women work two-thirds of the world's working hours and produce one-half of the world's food, we still earn only 1 percent of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the world's property.  Of the 300 million people living in poverty, 70 percent are girls and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Congress passed the PROTECT Act, a good bipartisan bill to prevent trafficking, there are still millions of women and girls who are trafficked, physically abused, sexually abused or face the threat of violence every day. In Iraq, Darfur and Afghanistan, women and girls continue to be the targets of extreme violence, brutality and intimidation where they face overwhelming, if not insurmountable, obstacles to legal recourse and justice. And in times of war and conflict, although most women  and children are not engaged in that conflict, they continue to suffer the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, it is important that Congress recognize the importance of March 8 and participate with the rest of the world in celebrating International Women's Day. Hopefully, the passage of this critical resolution will help raise awareness of the work we need to do and will help women continue to overcome the overwhelming obstacles that are still left to be overcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must make a commitment to invest in women. Women contribute to the growth of economies and improve the quality of the lives of their families, the health of their communities and their Nations. We have won many battles for equality and justice for women worldwide, and we can do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this resolution puts us, the United States House of Representatives, firmly on the side of women who are seeking gender equality across the world, and I urge its passage</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and it is such a pleasure to rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="149">H. Res. 149</bill> and to commend my colleague from Illinois, JAN SCHAKOWSKY, for bringing attention through this resolution to International Women's Day, and to thank my colleagues here in the House for their support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend from Illinois has pointed out, with today's passage of this resolution, the Congressional Caucus for  Women's Issues is passing the first item on its must-pass agenda list for the 110th Congress. What a fitting way that we begin this session and acknowledge the importance of International Women's Day and the significance of it in our country and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look around this world and we look here at home, we see that women are reaching the highest levels of power in many parts of the world and with our own country as well. They are being elected and appointed into positions previously reserved only for men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see this in our communities, in business positions and education and in civic life and we see it here in Congress. As has been noted, we have for the first time in our 200-year history as a democracy we have a woman Speaker of the House. We have in this 110th Congress the most women who have every served in this House. The Senate can say the same this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, today, women remain around the world and here in this country more likely to live in poverty, lack education, be victimized by violence than ever before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure and privilege to serve on the House Democracy Assistance Commission. In that capacity, I have visited several emerging democracies and have met with parliamentarians of other countries where these democracies are emerging. In each case, it is the women Members who reach out to me on behalf of their sisters throughout their country, and note with dismay that they have so many challenges to meet the needs of the women that they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was especially touched when I visited the women of Afghanistan in their 1-year-old democracy who have struggled over the years and are still struggling and are so determined, despite the extreme oppression by the Taliban, determined to take their role in the parliament. Both threats on their lives and harassment and violence have marred that passage. Determined to make a better life for themselves and their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me call out a similar kind of situation, a grassroots networking that I have seen and we have all experienced around this world today, networking to provide microloans from woman to woman, as is one of the nonprofit organizations called, giving women the opportunity to become self-sufficient for themselves and their families. They look to us as role models and as leaders, and yet we have our own challenges here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we become that role model for so many democracies around the world in so many emerging democracies, as we see that we have challenges facing our women in this country, let us celebrate then International Women's Day this Thursday making a firmer commitment to improving the lives of women here in the United States and throughout this world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from California for yielding to me and my good friend as well from Illinois for coming forward with this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To tell you the truth, I had often looked at bills which celebrate groups in two ways, because I noticed that only insurgent groups have such days named for them or groups most in need, and so they become days of celebration. I have warmed to them only because I have recognized why such groups have their own day, International Women's Day for example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is because having such a day provides an opportunity for a call to action. I wish I could come to the floor to celebrate women internationally. It is hard for me to do that when I see the progress in the global economy and look at what has happened and is happening internationally to women who are still chattel in most places in the world, who essentially would qualify as an oppressed group, not as a group seeking equality. So I think we ought to use International Women's Day to speak out  for women who cannot speak for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is to me perhaps most tragic is that the experience that most women in this country welcome is one that women across the world, particularly in developing countries, may dread, and that is the experience of pregnancy. Where pregnancy cannot be controlled by a woman, it is not the extraordinarily wonderful and welcome state that it is in our country. There will never be equality for women until women can control their own fertility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As long as women are subject to men, as long as they have no control over their own fertility, then you will see women with as much HIV and AIDS as men. Where saying "no" to a man isn't something you do as a woman, but something you can't do as a woman, you are not equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I call attention to the world that our country has done very little to help women across the world control their fertility and understand what equality means. We would not have women marching for equality and toward equality today if each and every woman who chose was not able to control her fertility. May we help obtain the same for our good sisters around the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud today to join Congresswoman JAN SCHAKOW-SKY--who continues to do a great job as a Chief Deputy Whip--in recognizing the importance of International Women's Day on March 8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 100 years ago, a group of courageous women proposed creating an International Women's Day to honor the women's rights movement and to continue the fight for universal suffrage. This day has since expanded in scope to serve as an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of women, and recommit ourselves to ending discrimination and violence against women across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the first commemoration of International Women's Day in 1910, women have made significant advances. Women have been elected to the highest levels of government across the world, and they serve as the leaders of nations such as Chile, Liberia, and Germany. An estimated 10.4 million businesses in the United States are owned by women. Worldwide, women receive eighty percent of all micro-loans to start small businesses. In the United States, women are graduating from high school and college  at record rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, while these accomplishments are indeed significant, we still have far more work to do. In the United States and across the world, women still face obstacles to political and economic equality. While women work two-thirds of the world's working hours, they earn only one percent of the world's income. Of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty, 70 percent are women and children. Violence against women continues at a horrific rate. These are unacceptable statistics, and we must do everything  we can to change them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mark this year's International Women's Day, we must renew and reaffirm our commitment to stopping violence against women and putting an end to discriminatory practices so that all women have a real opportunity to participate in society to the fullest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By recognizing International Women's Day and all that it represents, we give hope to women across the world. We honor the women who have fought--and continue to fight--for their rights, and I am proud to stand with them as we continue efforts to achieve equality and justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Congresswoman SCHAKOW-SKY for introducing this important bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to women by supporting the goals of International Women's Day. As a woman, I recognize and honor all the women who have fought and struggled for the equality of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women from all parts of the world are divided by ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic and political differences. This day will allow for the differences to be overshadowed by the similarities. This day will enable them to look back to a tradition that represents decades of struggle for equality, justice, peace, and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International Women's Day recognizes the importance of securing peace and allowing social progress by identifying the rights of women to equal opportunity and freedom. Women are being given the opportunity to participate in the workforce and contribute to international peace and security; this is an extraordinary advancement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of Congress, we need to reaffirm the commitment of ending discrimination and violence against women and girls. We must continue to encourage the President to affirm his commitment to pursue policies to protect human rights and civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the key fact remains: women themselves have the right to live in dignity. Let us rededicate ourselves to making that a reality by honoring International Women's Day. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of International Women's Day.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the goals of International  Women's Day. This is a day that not only recognizes the struggles women and girls have faced and continue to face throughout the world, but also celebrates their significant advancements and achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in the United States in the early 1900's, International Women's Day has grown to be recognized throughout the world each year on March 8th: from Australia, to Singapore, to Afghanistan, to Chile. This year alone, there are 269 International Women's Day events scheduled around the globe, with 44 occurring in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the inception of International Women's Day, women have made considerable progress throughout the world. A vast majority of women now have the right to vote. There currently are eleven women heads of state and 27 women presiding over national assemblies across the globe--including NANCY PELOSI, the first female Speaker of the U.S. House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of women's most notable legislative successes here at home include: securing the right to vote in 1920; passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963; Title IX in 1972; and the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these significant achievements, women in the United States and throughout the world still face obstacles to full equality. Women and girls are more likely to be illiterate, impoverished and a victim of domestic violence. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State estimates that every year, 800,000 to 900,000 people are victims of trafficking--most of them are women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here today--in solidarity with women and girls around the globe--to bring attention to International Women's Day. It is important to recognize and celebrate the obstacles women have surmounted on the road to equality. Additionally, I hope to bring attention to the inequalities that we still face, so that we can continue to break down gender barriers in the hope that we can one day eradicate gender inequality.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res, 149, a resolution supporting International Women's Day on March 8, 2007. For several decades the international community has reserved this day to celebrate the achievements and contributions of women around the world. International Women's Day is also a time to recognize and remember the work we still have before us to achieve equal social and political rights for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, women all over the world are becoming leaders in every professional field imaginable. The achievements of women in politics are especially noteworthy. As we celebrate Women's History Month in the United States, it is my honor to recognize this important Day under the historic leadership of the first woman Speaker of the House, my fellow Californian, NANCY PELOSI. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 110th Congress also marks the rise of six women to seven committee chair positions, the most ever held by women in any prior Congress:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD from California is chairing the House Committee on Administration;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER from New York is chairing the House Rules Committee;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman NYDIA VEL&amp;#193;ZQUEZ from New York is chairing the House Committee on Small Business;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS-JONES from Ohio is chairing the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN from California is chairing the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator BARBARA BOXER from California is chairing the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and is currently Acting Chair for the Senate Select Committee on Ethics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These women all honor our Nation with their distinguished service and leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to pay special tribute to my distinguished colleague Congresswoman ROS-LEHTINEN who has achieved the distinction of becoming the first woman Ranking Member on this committee. We all benefit from her contributions and those of all of the women Members who are performing important responsibilities on the Committee of Foreign Affairs with honor and distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite notable political progress for women in leadership positions in the U.S. and around the world, women continue to struggle for equal social and political rights; access to health care, education and work; and freedom from civil conflict, violence, human trafficking and various cultural practices that put women's lives at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The theme for this year's International Women's Day captures a critical goal we all must share: "ending impunity for violence against women and girls."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While manifestations of violence against women and girls vary across social, economic, cultural and historical contexts, it is clear that violence against women and girls remains a devastating reality in all parts of the world. The global evidence is chilling. Violence against women is a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the United Nations:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic violence is the largest form of abuse of women worldwide, irrespective of region, culture, ethnicity, education, class and religion. Violence against women is the most common but least punished crime in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of women forced or sold into prostitution is estimated worldwide at anywhere between 700,000 and 4 million per year. Profits from sex slavery are estimated at $7 to $l2 billion per year. The number of women trafficked into forced labor put these numbers at even more astounding levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that more than two million girls are genitally mutilated per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Systematic rape continues to be used as a weapon of terror in many of the world's recent conflicts--including Darfur, Bosnia and Rwanda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While international, regional and national legal and policy frameworks have been established, to address violence against women and girls, implementation of these laws and norms remains insufficient and inconsistent around the world. Gender inequality, poverty and endless cycles of violence are exacerbated as a result of failures to hold perpetrators of violence against women and girls accountable for their actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eliminating violence against women remains one of the most serious and urgent challenges of our time. Each one of us has a duty to support and sustain a political and social environment where violence against women and girls is not tolerated; where friends, family members, neighbors, men and women, intervene to ensure these crimes and acts are not committed with impunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will do everything in my power as chairman to ensure that every piece of legislation we consider in this Committee will improve the security, opportunity and prosperity of women and I know my colleagues will share this important goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague Congresswoman JAN SCHAKOWSKY and the other cosponsors of this resolution for giving us this opportunity to recognize the importance of International Women's Day. I am proud to support this resolution and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of House Resolution 149, in support of International Women's Day. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Schakowsky of Illinois, for introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women in every country around the world face an every-day battle for their safety, and for equal rights, civil rights, and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even here in this country, every day, women are victims of sexual assault, abuse, and domestic violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I stand with my colleagues in the House--with women in this country, and with women around the world--to make a commitment to work together to end discrimination and violence against women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I returned from a trip where I led a Congressional delegation of female members to visit Iraq. While. we were there, we met with Iraqi women who told us that they are treated like second class citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is unacceptable. Women in Iraq deserve the same basic human rights and civil liberties as men. It is fitting that we should take this occasion, on the day before March 8th--International Women's Day--to restate this basic and essential message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution, a message to women everywhere--that this House is committed to fight for their civil rights, human rights, and their right to live each day without fear of sexual abuse, assault, and domestic violence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="149">H. Res. 149</bill>, which supports the goals of International Women's Day (IWD). International Women's Day is a day on which millions around the world come together to commemorate their continued struggle for equality, justice, peace, and development for all women around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International Women's Day has grown to become a global day of recognition and celebration across developed and developing countries alike. For decades, IWD has grown from strength to strength annually. For many years the United Nations has held an annual IWD conference to coordinate international efforts for women's rights and participation in social, political and economic processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 1975 was designated as `International Women's Year' by the United Nations. Women's organizations and governments around the world have also observed IWD annually on March 8 by holding large-scale events that honor women's advancement and while diligently reminding of the continued vigilance and action required to ensure that women's equality is gained and maintained in all aspects of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are over 3,000,000,000 women in the world, representing 51 percent of the world's population; we need to celebrate and emphasize the important roles that women play around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout history women have faithfully and fervently forged a strong fight to tear down the walls of discrimination, bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots, and lay the foundation of a towering edifice of equality and justice. Some of these strong soldiers for justice include Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and Rosa Parks. I am extremely proud of the recent passage of <bill type="h" number="4510">H.R. 4510</bill>, a bill on which Senator HILLARY CLINTON and I worked diligently together to pay tribute to the enormous  contributions Sojourner Truth made in the interests of all women. <bill type="h" number="4510">H.R. 4510</bill> directs the Joint Committee on the Library to accept the donation of a bust depicting Sojourner Truth and to display the bust in a suitable location in the Capitol. On behalf of women in this country, and all around the world, it was important to urge the recognition and honor of abolitionist Sojourner Truth with the addition of her likeness to the statue commemorating women's suffrage in the United States Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women continue to play the prominent role in caring for families within the home as well as serving as economic earners. Women are defined by their versatility. Women not only cook, clean, and care for their children, but they also own and operate businesses, teach our schoolchildren, drive buses, create art, practice medicine and law, and legislate, as well as perform in many other capacities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All over the world women play important roles in the world of diplomacy and politics, contribute to the growth of economies, and improve the quality of the lives of their families, communities, and nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we recently celebrated the 2007 election of Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI as the first female Speaker of the House, a significant stride in the cause of promoting the advancement of women as leaders and major players in politics. We also witnessed the recent passage of <bill type="h" number="4510">H.R. 4510</bill>, a bill I proudly introduced which directed the Joint Committee on the Library to accept the donation of a bust depicting Sojourner Truth and to display the bust in a suitable location in the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of women in this country, and all around the world, it was important to urge the recognition and honor of abolitionist Sojourner Truth with the addition of her likeness to the statue commemorating women's suffrage in the United States Capitol.

Globally, each year over 500,000 women die during childbirth and pregnancy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also provide adequate protection and support systems that empower women to avoid or discontinue the victimization of abusive relationships.
