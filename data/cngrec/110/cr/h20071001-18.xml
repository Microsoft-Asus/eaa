  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 185, commending the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division of the Minnesota National Guard upon its completion of the longest continuous deployment of any United States military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I would like to thank my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) for bringing this measure before the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division was deployed for 22 months, nearly 2 years. That's how long they were continuously deployed. This is longer than any other ground combat unit in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Many Americans count down the hours until the end of the workday, until Friday night, until the end of the work week. Often our commitment to our jobs comes in bundles of 40 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the soldiers of the Red Bull Division had no such luxury. Counting down the time until redeployment was computed in entire weeks, if not months. Just when they and their families thought they were to come home, their deployment was extended by an additional 125 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 22 months some of our brave men and women in uniform missed their infants and their young children taking their first steps, saying their first words. Some of the roughly 5,000-member BCT missed their kids' high school graduations, and they didn't get a chance to move their sons and daughters into a dorm for college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So much can change in 2 years. So many precious moments that we hold dear pass by during this time. Yet we go about our daily lives and forget that these precious moments that we enjoy are being protected by America's tremendous servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more amazing is the fact that the members of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division are members of the National Guard. These are everyday folks, our neighbors and friends who signed up to be citizen soldiers. Their single deployment lasted as long as some active duty servicemembers' entire time in our Armed Forces. This was an extraordinary commitment and sacrifice on the part of the Red Bull Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Walz and Mr. Kline, our colleagues from Minnesota, will have much to say about these fine Minnesotans as representatives of that great State. But I would just like to say how proud I am as a Member of the United States House of Representatives and as an American, Mr. Speaker, of the 5,200 combat logistics patrols, the 2.4 million convoy miles, the 400 captured terrorists and the 22-month deployment that the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division  accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can never repay these servicemembers for their time and their tremendous sacrifice. But what we can do is enshrine our appreciation and thanks by passing this resolution into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 185.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 185, which commends the men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team/34th Infantry Division, Minnesota National Guard, for completing the longest continuous deployment of any United States combat team in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these men and women did not want to set this record. They didn't seek this record. In fact, when they left these shores, they had no idea this record was going to be theirs: 16 months in a combat zone, 22 months of mobilization. But when the word came, they didn't flinch. They set forward, they did their duty and they set a record, one which I certainly hope no other unit will ever be asked to surpass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team are some of this Nation's finest soldiers. Their first-rate service in Iraq carries on the tradition of excellence established by previous generations of the 1st Brigade, through service in the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and both world wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The more than 2,200 Minnesotans and 1,300 more Midwestern soldiers who served in the 1st Brigade in Iraq performed remarkably during their unrivaled tour of duty. These soldiers completed more than 5,200 combat logistics patrols, secured 2.4 million convoy miles, captured over 400 suspected insurgents, and discovered 462 improvised explosive devices prior to detonation. They also helped to start two Iraqi newspapers and completed 137 reconstruction projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mark of their commitment to the unit and to this Nation, more than 1,400 members of the brigade reenlisted, reenlisted, while in Iraq, and 21 members became United States citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout their long tour of duty, their historic tour of duty, the soldiers of the 1st Brigade Combat Team had the steady support of families and employers. The soldiers are now home and beginning the process of reintegration through the Minnesota National Guard's extensive Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, given their admirable and courageous service over so long a period of time, and in recognition of their willingness to put service to country over personal interest, it is only fitting that we take this opportunity to commend the men and women of the 1st Brigade Combat Team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) for bringing this measure forward and for his service with the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in strong support of this concurrent resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I intend to recognize the sponsor of this thoughtful resolution, but I think it is important for our colleagues to recognize his service as well. Mr. Walz from Minnesota spent 24 years himself in the Army National Guard, so he has had a full life of service to this country. I don't think he knew when he enlisted at the young age of 17 that he would end up so many years in the Army National Guard. He also became a teacher. But he achieved the rank of command sergeant  major.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to Command Sergeant Major WALZ, my friend and colleague from Minnesota, the sponsor of this thoughtful resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her kind words, and I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his many years of leadership and his service also and to the whole Armed Services Committee for this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am urging my colleagues, and I am sure it will not take a lot of urging. This House of Representatives understands. This resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 185, has recognized the incredible contributions, courage, and sacrifice of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the National Guard that they have given to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July of 2005, members of the 1/34th Brigade Combat Team of the famed Red Bull Division were notified of their deployment. Twenty-two months later, in July of 2007, they began returning home, after a 22-month deployment. As my colleague from Minnesota said, they had no intention or no knowledge that they would be setting a record. They simply said yes when they were called upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you have heard from each of my colleagues, the statistics are amazing on what this unit did: 5,200 combat logistic patrols covering 2.4 million convoy miles. You heard Mr. Kline talk about the number of IEDs that were found. A full 37 percent of the total IED incidents during their time there were attributed to the diligent work of this unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They helped start the Iraqi newspapers that you heard about, and they also helped produce documentaries on the positive work that our units are doing in Iraq. They completed 137 reconstruction projects; and during this deployment, as you heard, they reenlisted 1,400 of these brave citizen soldiers. And I think a really special thing is 21 of them became citizens during their time in service to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although they were originally slated to come home, they endured a 125-day extension, and their families and employers endured that with them. This record of the longest continuous deployment of any U.S. military operation in Iraqi Freedom is something to be incredibly proud of. Being there is one thing. Contributing positively the way they did is quite another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The soldiers sacrificed 2 years of their lives in service to their country. I know how much they have given, as I was a former member of this Red Bull Division myself; and I know many of these men and women personally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have added to the long and impressive list of the Red Bull. Their lineage goes back to the 1st Minnesota Volunteers, the first unit to volunteer for the Civil War. The Red Bulls had 517 days of actual combat in World War II, that is more than any other U.S. division during the war, and captured more enemy hills and territory than any other division in World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, along with the rest of the Minnesota delegation in both the House and the Senate, introduced this resolution to honor their service and to recognize not just the soldiers, but their families and employers who patiently supported, loved and cared for them and waited for them until they returned to the Midwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues from Minnesota for their work in support of this resolution, especially my colleague Mr. Kline from Minnesota. My colleague from Minnesota himself is a lieutenant colonel, a lifelong and career Marine Corps officer and one that served with distinction. He understands and he too knows the sacrifice that they have given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the 30 other Members of Congress who cosponsored this resolution to show their support of the 1st Brigade Combat Team. But most of all, I want to thank the 2,447 soldiers of the 1st Brigade Combat Team from Minnesota. The other soldiers that augmented this unit came from Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Kentucky, Idaho, and Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Red Bulls have truly lived up to their long and heroic tradition and have contributed bravely to the war in Iraq and this Nation's security. Regardless of what any American feels about the war in Iraq, it is clear that America's servicemembers, like those from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, have performed brilliantly and magnificently; and they deserve our full support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now Congress must do its part to recognize their service and provide them the benefits and the health care that they need. The Minnesota National Guard has a world-class reintegration program, the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program, which helps soldiers readjust to civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend and colleague and fellow Minnesotan, Congressman Kline, for working to expand this program nationwide for all soldiers. His leadership in this is appreciated by soldiers and families across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Their needs will go far beyond reintegration. Long after the initial fanfare fades, Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs must stand ready to assist these brave warriors throughout the rest of their lives. They have more than earned our support, and we must be certain they always have it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to show their support for the Red Bulls by adopting this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself a moment to say that I urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution. The service that these men and women performed is truly historic and commendable. Again, I thank Mr. Walz for bringing this measure forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of this legislation which commends Minnesota's First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division for their completion of the longest continuous deployment of any United States military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This extraordinary group of men and women, also known as the Red Bulls, is comprised of about 3,700 dedicated Minnesotans and some 1,300 more soldiers from other Midwestern States. Recently, more than 1,000 of our courageous Red Bulls returned home from a 22-month deployment to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During their time in the Middle East, the First Brigade Combat Team protected lives and helped to preserve the blessings of liberty here at home. They discovered 462 improvised explosive devices, IEDs, before they were able to wreak havoc on the innocent. By finding these IEDs prior to detonation, the First Brigade Combat Team surely saved the lives of countless fellow soldiers and Iraqi citizens. They also captured over 400 suspected insurgents and completed 137 reconstruction projects. In addition,  the First Brigade Combat Team successfully processed over 1.5 million vehicles and 400,000 Iraqis into entry control points without any insurgent penetrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor the First Brigade Combat Team, whose bravery and commitment to serving our country is as apparent today as it has been in wars long past. These soldiers have returned with an outstanding record of achievement and have earned hundreds of awards including: one Silver Star, 151 Bronze Stars, 32 Purple Hearts, 771 Army Commendation Medals, 136 Combat Infantry Badges, 302 Combat Action Badges and 14 Combat Medical Badges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The important measure before us today recognizes the service of our Red Bull soldiers, and reminds us of the price of our freedom, and those who have freely chosen to honor it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To our Red Bulls, and all of the men and women that defend this Nation, my colleagues and I continue to stand in awe of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, and may God bless you and your families.</paragraph>
