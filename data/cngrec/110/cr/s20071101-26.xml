    <paragraph>Mr. President, in my remarks dealing with the CHIP bill, I spoke profusely about the cooperation of the distinguished Speaker. She has been wonderful on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes, you leave out your friends. Steny Hoyer and I have known each other for many years. We have served in Congress together for 25 years. I failed to mention his work on this bill. He has been vigilant and with us every step of the way, and I should have mentioned his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to say that in speaking--my staff, frankly, has spoken to him; I have not in the last hour or so. One of the things that very well could happen is that the House may not send the bill to the President for a while--the bill he says he is going to veto--to give the negotiators more time to see if they can come up with something. That is certainly something I think would be a wise thing for the House to do. Since we got the suggestion from Steny Hoyer, I am sure it is very wise. So that  is one thing the House may do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, everyone has cooperated. I appreciate very much the work and the stage where we are.</paragraph>
