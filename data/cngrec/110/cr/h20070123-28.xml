    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when I last served in Congress, I made it my mission to discuss missing and exploited children at every opportunity, and I rise today to bring attention to the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing annually and to the thousands of children who go missing every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pedro Maldonado is just one of those children. Pedro is missing from Camden, New Jersey. He is 17 years old and was last seen on September 14, last year. At that time he was 5&#xAC;11" and weighed 180 pounds. He is biracial, white and Hispanic, and has black hair and brown eyes. Pedro has a scar above his right eye and may still be seen in the local area. He may still be in the Camden area and is considered "endangered missing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask that anyone who is watching this proceeding, especially if they are in New Jersey or New York, take a moment, look at Pedro's picture to see if you recognize him, and anyone having information should contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST or the Camden City Police Department at 856-757-7400.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time we bring our missing children home.</paragraph>
