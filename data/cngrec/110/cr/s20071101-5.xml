  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - November 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13647">S13647</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will conduct morning business for 1 hour, and the time will be equally divided and controlled, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the second half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, the children's health insurance legislation. Cloture was invoked on that motion to proceed yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated, after the cloture vote, if we have to stay here to run the 30 hours postcloture, that time will expire at 12:50 a.m. tomorrow morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had several conversations with Senator McConnell with reference to this legislation and how we can move forward with concluding action in a manner that would not cause the Senate to remain in session over the weekend. But there is no guarantee we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interim, our debate will continue on the motion today. If and when an agreement is reached with respect to moving forward, Members will be alerted to the schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some Senators working to come up with another compromise, and I hope they can do that. If they can, I will be the first to have that matter effectuated. At this stage, that hasn't been done. I had a number of meetings yesterday with interested Senators, but talking about it and getting there are two different things. We will work to see what we can do.</paragraph>
