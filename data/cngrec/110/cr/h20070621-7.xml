    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Lonestar Voice this week comes from Geoffrey Brown of Baytown, Texas. Here is what he has to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We need to show more sympathy for these people. They travel miles in the heat, they risk their lives crossing a border. They don't get paid enough wages. They do jobs that others won't do or are afraid to do. They live in crowded conditions among a people who speak a different language. They rarely see their families, and they face adversity all day every day. No, I'm not talking about illegals; I'm talking about our troops. Doesn't it seem strange that the (politicians) are willing to lavish  all kinds of social benefits on illegals, but don't support our troops and have threatened to defund them?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Geoffrey Brown echoes the sentiments of many other Americans who wonder why so many people in Washington show more concern for illegals  who pledge allegiance to other countries than they do our U.S. troops fighting in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting the American military and our veterans is more important than expensive giveaway programs to illegals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
