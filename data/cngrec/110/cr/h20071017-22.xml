    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on March 22, 1915, the Missouri General Assembly set aside the third Wednesday of October each year as Missouri Day. Due to the efforts of Mrs. Anna Korn, a native Missourian, Missouri Day is a time for schools to honor the State and for people in the State to celebrate the achievements of all Missourians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all those from the Show Me State to reflect on the bounty of our great State today and the achievements of Missourians past and present. For Missourians away from home here in Washington, please join fellow Missourians here in our Nation's Capitol tonight from 5:30-7:30 in 1710 Longworth for the Missouri Day 2007 celebration.</paragraph>
