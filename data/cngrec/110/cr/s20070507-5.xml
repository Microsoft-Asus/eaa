    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4 o'clock, with the time equally divided and controlled by the respective leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill>, the FDA bill, at 4 p.m. today. Upon resuming the bill, the Senate will begin several votes: first, the Cochran second-degree amendment to the Dorgan amendment, then the Dorgan amendment, and then the cloture vote on the substitute amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the managers will be here very soon to seek consent to dispose of amendments they have already worked out. Also, Members have until 3 o'clock today to file any first-degree amendments. In addition to filing cloture on the committee substitute amendment and the bill, I also filed cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act, which is known as WRDA. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation, led by Senators BOXER and INHOFE. I am hopeful  it will not be necessary to have that cloture vote and that we will be able to proceed to the bill once action is concluded on the FDA bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members should be ready for a number of votes starting at around 4 o'clock today. The first vote will be 15 minutes, and the remaining votes will be 10-minute votes. Everyone should be alerted to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another matter which I mentioned last week is going to conference with respect to the budget resolution. The House was slated to take that up this evening. I think now it may be tomorrow when they will take it up, so that message may not get to us until Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very busy week, so everyone should be aware of the different votes that may be necessary. We hope we can complete work on the FDA bill tonight. That is certainly possible; otherwise, maybe in the early morning.</paragraph>
