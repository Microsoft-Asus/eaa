    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, April 28 marks the 20th annual Workers Memorial Day. I rise with other members of the Labor and Working Family Caucus to acknowledge the millions of workers who have been killed or injured on the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1970, OSHA has been a driving force in improving workplace safety across the country. However, the Bush administration has sought to downsize the agency. A weakened OSHA has real life-or-death consequences for workers, such as Cintas employee Eleazar Torres-Gomez who died last year when he was dragged into an industrial dryer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Torres-Gomez's fate is, unfortunately, too common. Sixteen workers die every day in our country from work-related injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, along with Representative Lynn Woolsey, I introduced the Protecting America's Workers Act, which amends OSHA to cover more workers, and strengthens protections and accountability. During Workers Memorial Week, the best way to honor our workers is to quickly send this bill to the President's desk.</paragraph>
