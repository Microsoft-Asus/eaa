    <paragraph>Mr. President, once we were able to see beyond the death, destruction, and suffering that Hurricane Katrina wrought, we saw that America is unprepared for a megacatastrophe. We learned that lesson at the expense of those in the gulf states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, our vulnerability is not limited to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, or to our Southern Atlantic States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty-seven percent of Americans live in areas prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, or other massive disasters. We know about the quakes that have rocked California, Oregon, and Alaska. But the largest earthquake to strike the continental U.S. was centered in New Madrid, MO, in 1811. It rattled a swath of land that spanned from Mississippi to Michigan, from Pennsylvania to Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty States, including Hawaii, and States that share a shoreline with the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, face the threat of hurricanes or severe storms every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Jersey experienced the second most severe storm in its history just last month. These downpours forced nearly 5,000 New Jerseyans to evacuate their homes and led to the deaths of at least three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing numbers of people make those areas of vulnerability their homes every day. Eight out of the eleven most costly U.S. natural catastrophes have occurred since 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failures of Katrina--from neglected levies to negligent leadership--must be acknowledged and addressed now, before the next catastrophe strikes. We have a moral obligation to learn from that experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America needs an integrated program that unifies State and Federal policies to prepare and protect American families from the devastation of natural catastrophes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are steps we can and must take--and we must take them today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must prevent unnecessary loss of life and property by encouraging State and local governments to enact sensible building codes and land use policies that recognize the exposure to natural catastrophes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must support first responders with the equipment, training, and personnel needed to save lives and reduce property damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must educate consumers and provide them the tools they need to prepare for catastrophes and protect their families and homes from harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must establish a rigorous process of continuous improvement by learning from past mistakes and assessing recovery efforts after every disaster to identify ways to continually improve our ability to recover from catastrophes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Senate colleagues, the warnings before Hurricane Katrina were shamefully ignored and unheeded, the response was slow and erratic, and this Nation paid an enormous price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been warned. We must learn from the lessons of Katrina and exhibit the leadership America needs to be prepared and protected from catastrophes to come.</paragraph>
