  <narrative>THE FARM BILL -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14600">S14600</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will break for the Thanksgiving holiday. We will all travel back to our States. We will work in our offices. We will move around our States. We will probably celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with our families and our friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us who are so very blessed will gather together next Thursday at tables surrounded by family, echoing with laughter, overflowing with food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too many families in my home State of Ohio and across the Nation next Thursday will be very different. These families, many of whom work full-time, simply do not earn enough each month to survive without the assistance of food stamps and food banks and help from churches and help from other organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many families suffering from layoffs--layoffs caused by plant closings, the offshoring of jobs, and the downsizing of American industry--are now solely reliant on food stamps and food banks to feed their families. Adding anguish to heartache, food banks, the last hope many have for getting even just one meal a day, are finding themselves running short on food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday's Cincinnati Enquirer told the story of Denise Arnold, a mother from Roselawn, OH, a suburb of Cincinnati. Since losing her job, and while looking for another job, Ms. Arnold has fallen behind on her rent and worries about becoming homeless. She has applied for food stamps, but that process takes time, and she has a son to feed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Arnold visits the St. Vincent de Paul food pantry industry to get what food she can for her family. She told the reporter: It is really rough. I have been so scared. The pantry once was able to offer a week's supply of food to those in need. Now, because of budget cuts and inadequate funding, this pantry must ration out, as so many others do, to their visitors, a few days' worth at a time, not a full week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to yesterday's newspaper article, food pantries across the region have similar stories to report. On this floor, I have shared the story of Rhonda Stewart, a single mother from Butler County, OH, who relies on food stamps to feed her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Stewart bravely shared her story before the Senate Agriculture Committee several months ago as we began the process of writing the 2007 farm bill. She told us she has a young son and is fairly recently divorced. Her husband--her ex-husband--has lost his job and is not able to support the son or his former wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has a full-time job, only making about $9 an hour. She is president of the local PTA and volunteers for the Cub Scouts. She teaches Sunday school. She does everything we ask of a citizen and a parent, and she is a food stamp beneficiary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, she told us, at the beginning of the month, she and her son--she cooks pork chops once or twice that first week. That is his favorite meal. By the middle of the month, she takes him out to a fast food restaurant perhaps once or twice. By the end of the month, she always runs out of money. She sits at the dining room or the kitchen table with her son, and that last couple of days of the month at dinnertime he is eating dinner, and she is sitting there not eating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says: Mom, what is wrong?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She says: I am not feeling well, or I am not hungry. She said it happens month after month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, food stamps provide a benefit of about $1 per person per meal. So Rhonda Stewart was getting $6 per day for food stamps. She traveled to Washington to let us know what mattered most to her and to her family and to families like hers. She had every right to expect that we would listen and we would hear her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, more than 35 million Americans went hungry. We must ask ourselves, how many more will go hungry next Thursday and Friday and Saturday and Sunday and into the rest of the holiday season?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I raise this issue today because at this moment we are debating in this Chamber legislation that literally means the difference between food and hunger for Ms. Arnold, Ms. Stewart, and millions of families in this country, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of families in my home State of Ohio like theirs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a nation wealthy as ours, eradicating hunger, eliminating poverty, investing in families should not be a political issue. It is not Republican versus Democrat. It is food and shelter versus Americans who aren't as fortunate as all of us in this body, as the staff, the Senators, all of us. This is a moral obligation, a duty that flows from compassion and the very reason we have been sent here as public servants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November of last year, families in my State of Ohio, as they did in the State of the Presiding Officer, sent a loud and clear message that they wanted change. They demanded in no uncertain terms that the priorities championed here in Washington better reflect their own back home. Given their call for change and the unquestionable understanding of challenges facing families across the country, one must pause and reflect on what we are actually doing here. We have a responsibility to think about  the priorities being debated this week, this very day as part of the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the one hand, we have been arguing for weeks about how many tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, an industry gets out of this bill. We have been arguing over profit margins. On the other hand, we have in this legislation language that would fund food banks by an additional $110 million each year. We have legislation that would increase food stamp funding by $5 billion over 5 years and would help millions of new families with food assistance. We have the opportunity in this bill  to validate for Ms. Arnold and Ms. Stewart and the millions of mothers like them across the country that their voices do in fact matter. These are not issues being discussed only within these walls. This is a question of principle. It is a call to action the public understands very well. The public understands how important are the issues of hunger, social justice, investing in families, at every level of income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Ohio food banks and businesses such as First Energy and the Kroger Company for their dedication and initiative. This year First Energy and its employees, as part of their Harvest for Hunger campaign, collected the equivalent of nearly 2 million meals. This week the Kroger Company helped jump-start a Hunger is Unacceptable campaign in greater Cincinnati.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Local social service agencies in the area are pooling resources to help fight hunger more effectively. What these stories say to me is that people back home get it. They get it in Cincinnati, in Columbus, and in Cleveland. It is time that Washington gets it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to remember that budgets and bills are more than ink on paper. They are a set of priorities, and they are about our values. I strongly encourage my colleagues not to delay in passing the farm bill and to remember how many families are depending on them for us to stand up for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully expect and encourage families back home to continue watching what we do and to hold all of us accountable for our actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say to Ms. Arnold--with a very special mention to Rhonda Stewart--that so many of us in this Chamber hear you. We are fighting for you, and we will not give up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his service on the Agriculture Committee. He has brought new vision, new vigor to the committee. We very much appreciate his service there. This has been a difficult challenge, but I think we can be very proud of the result. This bill is fiscally responsible, and at the same time it does begin the orientation of priorities. It gives additional funding to not only conservation but to nutrition, where the Senator from Ohio has been a  real leader. Over and over he has reminded us of not only our responsibility to fellow Americans, but a moral responsibility we have to make certain we change some of these programs that are so critically important to people all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is so often overlooked that the vast majority of the money in the farm bill, 66 percent of the funding, goes for nutrition. That is where the vast majority of the spending goes. We can be very proud of the changes that have been made. We have added over $5 billion above the baseline for nutrition, to begin to address things that have not been changed for 30 years. The Senator from Ohio has been a leader, somebody who prodded us all to be better than we have been. I thank the Senator from Ohio  for his leadership.</paragraph>
