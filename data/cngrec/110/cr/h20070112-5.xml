    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it matters what government does. Every day the policies we enact can make life easier or harder for ordinary citizens. It starts at 5 or 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning, when millions of senior citizens in this country begin their day by taking prescription drug medicine. That should be an experience that makes them feel like someone is looking out for them. Instead, the current part D program has left our seniors feeling anxious and confused. What they cannot understand,  Madam Speaker, what no one can understand, because there is no rational explanation for it, is why the Medicare program has been prohibited from negotiating for lower drug prices. Of course there is an explanation: a deal was struck to benefit the insurance and pharmaceutical industries at the expense of our seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the legislation before us today will repeal this prohibition and empower the Secretary to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill> makes common sense, and it does right by our seniors. I look forward to bipartisan passage of this important legislation.</paragraph>
