    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, back home in Texas I visited with families whose cost is so high that one woman in Bridge City told me she doesn't even go to Wednesday night church. She can't afford to drive to it. Just on Sunday. I talked to small businesses that now work, painters and plumbers and others, who now basically work for free because gas prices have eaten up all their profits. I visited this last week with our law enforcement agencies, who are no longer able to be proactive in  the community. They are just responding to calls because they burned through much of their fuel budget for the year already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In each case, every one of them asked me, Why isn't America doing more? Why isn't America taking more responsibility for our own energy needs? We import two-thirds of all we use. We are capable of doing more. In each case, they said, Look, take a message back to Congress. No more gimmicks. No more gimmicks. We need more American-made energy here in the United States to get our fuel prices down, to be less dependent on Middle East fuel, to have some say over the prices that our families and small  businesses pay.</paragraph>
