    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007. This important legislation would reauthorize appropriations of $125 million for the EPA's alternative water sources grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, rapid population growth and development along with an increased awareness of the impact of massive water withdrawals and the threat of global climate change have forced many local communities to explore alternative sources of water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> provides one alternative for meeting these future water needs by encouraging the testing and implementation of technology that reclaim and reuse water from municipal, industrial and agricultural needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the efforts of my colleagues on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Congressman McNerney and Congresswoman Tauscher, for their efforts in moving this legislation forward and ensuring that communities are able to meet current and future water needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This committee approved similar legislation in the 109th Congress, and it is my hope this year Congress will finally approve legislation and forward it to the President for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007. I want to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member, Mr. Baker, for their hard work on this particular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> extends the pilot program under the Clean Water Act for alternative water source projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growth in population, increasing demands for water, and drought are resulting in water shortages in many areas around our Nation, both in the west and the east.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many communities are finding that their water supply needs cannot be met by existing water supplies. As a result, many communities and their water resource development agencies are looking at alternative ways to alleviate their water shortages and enhance water supplies to meet their future water needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important issue not only for my home State of Arkansas but for the many other parts of the country facing increasing demands for water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adequate water is needed to sustain our country's economic growth and viability. Some of the approaches they are looking at involve reclaiming, reusing or conserving water that has already been used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> provides an authority to help communities meet some of their critical water supply needs through water reclamation, reuse, conservation and management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> authorizes $125 billion for the EPA to make grants to water resource development agencies for these sorts of alternative water source projects. The program leverages non-Federal resources by requiring a non-Federal cash of 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support this important bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairmen Oberstar and Johnson and Ranking Members Mica and Baker for their leadership on clean water issues and for their work to bring the legislation we are considering today to the floor. In addition, I would like to thank my colleague and good friend, Mrs. Tauscher, for supporting this legislation with me. Mrs. Tauscher and I have adjoining districts in California, and we have similar water needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, is straightforward and helpful legislation that I hope both parties will support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone recognizes the need for clean water. It does not matter whether you live in a city or in the rural, it does not matter what your political persuasion is. We all need clean water. Therefore, it is vitally important to identify new water sources for use in agriculture, industry and for residential consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, the State Revolving Loan Funds and Clean Water Act construction grants were available for identifying new water sources. But communities now increasingly depend on those funds just to provide for the maintenance and upkeep of existing water infrastructure, rather than finding new and potentially less expensive water supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> will provide $125 million so that local governments can innovate to collect, clean and distribute new sources of water. The Healthy Communities Water Supply Act will encourage municipalities, public and private water agencies and nonprofit organizations to find ways to provide new sources of water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the small investment of Federal funding provided in this bill, we can spur innovation in water resources and move towards solving the increasingly pressing need to ensure clean water for drinking, for family farms, for businesses and for households.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> encourages innovation by funding pilot projects and forward-thinking ideas that lead to practical solutions, which can be applied across the board. This legislation means jobs in local communities by spurring the kind of research that can create new businesses and make our towns and cities more livable at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The constant threat of drought in the Western States, along with the reality of global warming, emphasizes why the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007 is so important. We must begin to investigate alternative water sources now, so that we can make strides in ensuring that we have water that we need in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that we can move quickly to pass <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> and to work with the other body so we can provide water relief for our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Texas, for yielding the time and compliment her and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), the ranking member of the subcommittee, for developing this legislation and preparing it and bringing it so early in the session to the House floor. I also appreciate the bipartisan cooperation with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of the full committee, and it is good to  have the gentleman from Arkansas on the floor and managing the bill. I thank the gentleman for his ever thoughtful approach to legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This alternative water sources initiative is not something that we developed in the course of this Congress. It started way back in 2000, in fact, earlier than that, as the committee held hearings over a period of several years to raise the visibility of issues of water supply and groundwater withdrawals and needs of communities well off into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I should point out that a former colleague of ours, later Speaker, Jim Wright, in 1958 wrote a book entitled, "The Coming Water Famine," where then new Congressman Wright gathered enormous amount of data about water usage by industry, by agriculture, by homeowners, and did a calculation that showed the rising use of water intersecting with a line of steady availability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the water there ever was, there ever will be, is available now. We will not create new water, and he showed that in the 1980s the lines would intersect, and that, at that point, the Nation and the Congress need to face up to the need to assure the continuity of availability of water supplies, that continued withdrawal of water from the Ogallala aquifer that covers west Texas and eastern Oklahoma, a huge area of the central portion of the United States, could not continue forever. That water  would be withdrawn, and there would be no further water available, just simply was not replenishing as fast as surface needs were drawing upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the background. That was the stimulus for the alternative water  sources program that our committee included in the Estuaries and Clean Water Act of 2000, which passed the House, the Senate and was signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation was developed to address the concerns by communities all across the country over availability of water to meet their future requirements, especially in the more arid regions of the country, as we have already heard from the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney) and Mrs. Tauscher, also from California, who was the initiator of this legislation in previous Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have read a great deal about climate change that followed the enormous amount of scientific data pouring forth from the international geophysical year by the United Nations scientific panel, scientists in the U.S. who are reporting on global climate change, and the effect that it is having upon weather and the increasing volatility and variability of the amount, timing and distribution of moisture, not just rainfall but moisture that comes in the form of snow or freezing rain. There is consensus  among the climatology scientific community that the timing, intensity and duration of floods, droughts and high-intensity storms are going to continue to plague us over the decades ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pressure for additional sources of drinking water, usable water for industry and agriculture will only grow and magnify across this country, putting greater pressure on reclamation, on reuse, on advanced wastewater treatment, and even on desalination, as many countries in the world are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1970s, there was an experiment by a Saudi prince who chartered a vessel to go to Antarctica and harness an iceberg, put a huge plastic wrap under that iceberg so it would not melt and had it towed by tug boats to a point off the shore of Saudi Arabia. Then they drilled a hole in the center of it and pumped the water out for several years to bring fresh water to Saudi Arabia. There are not going to be very many icebergs left to be towed as the polar caps melt faster than we can harness  the icebergs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, that experiment proved enormously expensive. It also demonstrated that there is a considerable amount of loss of iceberg water capability as the 'berg is towed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to do much better than just towing icebergs. We create with this legislation a modest start on a program to help communities provide for their current needs, for household requirements, industrial needs, for agricultural uses of water, well off into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is but one important step in the long-term effort we must make to ensure the availability of water supplies and the viability of those water supplies off into the future in this time of highly uncertain climate conditions.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California, the primary author of the legislation, Mrs. Tauscher.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400396" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, Chairman Johnson, for the opportunity to speak today in support of the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have joined my good friend and neighbor, Jerry McNerney, in introducing <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>. As Californians, Mr. McNerney and I know how precious every drop of water is to our communities, our economy, and our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation provides a real Federal commitment to exploring alternative water sources now so we can have the water supplies we will need in the future. This legislation will reauthorize a critical EPA program which was authorized in 2000 by the then Republican-controlled Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Republican Congress' commitment to the program and water supply reliability ended with words, not deeds. The program was never funded, and the EPA never implemented it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, today is a very new day. This Congress has the opportunity to provide local communities with the means to invest in critical alternative water source projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing a modest $125 million authorization for this EPA program, we will help communities plan for their future; and investing in innovative projects such as water recycling, water reuse and aquifer storage will allow our local communities to use water more effectively and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own district, these types of projects are already under way and will benefit from today's legislation. Projects like the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program and the Bay Area Regional Desalination Project are all advancing alternative water sources now and will be able to continue their work through access to these grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are effectively to plan for our Nation's future to use critical resources, there has to be Federal investment and innovation. The passage of <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> will clearly indicate that this Congress is ready to lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, some are trying to say that this program is duplicative, that these types of projects can already be funded through existing sources. First, let me say that we all understand that programs such as the Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds can be used for alternative water source projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in fiscal year 2007, the President's budget cut the Clean Water State Revolving Fund by 22 percent, and in the fiscal year 2006 he recommended that the fund be cut by $370 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me ask a simple question: Where will our communities find the resources to maintain and improve critical infrastructure and plan for the future if the Bush administration and the Republicans in Congress keep cutting the funds? It is disingenuous for anyone to claim that there are already resources available for these critical water projects while they are cutting the funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is time for us all to be responsible. It is time to make critical investments in water infrastructure which have been neglected for all too long, and it is time to ensure our communities can plan for their future water needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act, which was passed by a voice vote in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again, I rise to support this bill, very much so. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Mica and Ranking Member Baker and their staffs for their hard work and the efforts that they put into this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for speakers. I want to express my appreciation to all of the staff of the committee. I ask for support of <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to support <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, a reauthorization of a Pilot Program for Increasing Usable Water Supply. As you well know, this Pilot Program for increasing usable water supply was authorized for 2002 through 2004, but the previous majority never appropriated any funds and let the authorization expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues just how important it is to supplement existing water supplies by providing reliable high-quality sources of water, particularly in areas of the country that are under the threat of the desert. In California, especially in Orange County, the population is increasing; so is the need for water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 15 years, the Orange County Water District has maintained a Groundwater Replenishment System designed to reuse advanced treated wastewater to recharge the County's groundwater aquifers and basin. This will help them meet the annual water needs of over 144,000 families that keep growing. Also, the county is barely 3 miles from the coast and has an added need to protect the Basin  from further degradation due to seawater intrusion. To this end,  the OCWD under its Phase I project provides over 72 million gallons of water per day to replenish its aquifers as well as protect them from seawater intrusion by pumping water through injection wells. This phase will end in September, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Phase II of the project, they will be able to process over 250 million gallons of wastewater per day and have enough to support the recharge effort and combat seawater intrusion. There are currently 30 such injection wells that can pump water up to 60-100 feet depth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beauty of this project is the collaboration the Water District has with the County's Sanitation District (OCSD) who provides the wastewater that would have been pumped out to the ocean thereby which would have deprived the Water District of the water that is now being reclaimed for the replenishment of groundwater aquifers. And the State Health Department provides the oversight, to make sure water quality is maintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With projects like this, communities such as Orange County will benefit tremendously. This OCGW project has attracted experts in public water management systems from other States and countries (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) who come to Orange County to look at this tertiary system and learn from it. So, this is of national and even internatIonal significance. Also, projects like the OCGWR provides for the necessary investments to ensure water security for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help improve water availability and quality by authorizing a total of $125 million to fund projects that increase usable water supply by encouraging innovation in water reclamation, reuse and conservation. The Orange County Water Reclamation Project is a perfect example of such a project and I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the "Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007" which authorizes $125 million to enhance water supplies in shortage-plagued areas through the development of such alternative sources as waste water reuse and other water recycling projects. The funding will be used to help finance pilot projects to recycle water for drinking and agricultural use in states like Texas that have long faced chronic supply shortages amid continuing  population booms. States would have to pay half the cost of the projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the new majority in this House understands that ensuring clean water is a top priority for America's working families. A clean and healthy environment begins with clean water. <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> will help to make the Nation's water supply cleaner and healthier by utilizing alternative water sources such as waste water and recycled water. If we explore alternative water supplies now, we take a giant step toward ensuring that we will have adequate supplies in the future.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> All time for general debate has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act, is designed to help communities with current or impending water shortages. I support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that such shortages can have many causes. For example, global warming is likely to cause or exacerbate water shortages in the U.S., especially in the Southwest. Under those conditions, alternative water sources will be more important than ever, but communities all over the United States are also fighting to protect their water supplies from overpumping by bottled water companies, who are making billions of dollars from this public resource. My amendment would remove from consideration  for these Federal subsidies those areas where bottled water companies are contributing to the demise of the water supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the International Bottled Water Association, the volume of water privatized has increased between 8 and 12 percent every year since 2001. In 2006, bottled water companies enjoyed $11 billion in revenue from the United States alone. It is estimated that about 25 percent of the bottled water consumed in the United States comes from municipal water supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects of the excessive influence of the bottled water industry can go beyond the regional confines of water source depletion and environmental destruction. It codifies a preference for corporate access to water over public access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent the Cleveland area, that, like many cities nearby, relies on Lake Erie for drinking water. A few years ago, there were two instances in which a company received a permit to privatize Great Lakes water in bulk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In both instances, the projects were abandoned because of the public outcry. In response, the Great Lakes States, with assistance from Canadian Premiers and other stakeholders, attempted to negotiate the conditions under which water could be withdrawn from the lake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the negotiations closed, bottled water companies managed to wedge their language into the final agreement. The language also allowed virtually unlimited withdrawals for bottled water companies, while attempting to protect against other privatization attempts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such unprecedented favoritism can actually represent a giant step backwards for the notion of water as a public trust. The loophole leaves the entire agreement open to commerce clause challenge or to a challenge in the World Trade Organization. If such a challenge were successful, there would be no limits to privatization of Great Lakes water. It would open the water of the Great Lakes to use by the growing and increasingly thirsty regions where they are having water shortages and where water  shortages make it financially viable to pipe water across several States. We would not just be back to square one; we would take a giant step backwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a classic example, Mr. Chairman, in which greed of the bottled water companies is garnering profits at the expense of the public. I have not even talked about the overeffect of pumping, like the increased cost of finding a replacement source, the loss of connected streams, lakes and rivers, the land subsidence, the salt water intrusion near coasts that render the water undrinkable, and the loss of wildlife habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example is emblematic of conflicts between communities and bottled water companies all over the United States. In two small towns in New Hampshire, Nottingham and Barrington, a company called USA Springs is attempting to drill wells that would pump 310,000 gallons a day in an area populated with homes that get their water from small private household wells. The community is worried about a loss of water supply, loss of water quality, and degradation of nearby wetlands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A very conservative estimate said that USA Springs is looking at about $303 million per year in revenue from this site alone. With that kind of revenue potential, it can be expected they will spend big to make this project happen. This is exactly what they are doing. The result is that USA Springs  is now dangerously close to winning a battle that started in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basic building blocks of life, like water, must be accessible by people before corporations, period. When access to the essentials is threatened by outside excessive private gain, I will stand firmly in defense of the public every time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I intend to explore this issue deeply as Chair of the Domestic Policy Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I ask the chairman, my good friend from Minnesota, to work with me as Chair of Transportation and Infrastructure on the broader issue of water privatization and its effects on quality and access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to Mr. Oberstar.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman raises a very important issue, one that has been of deep concern. He raises two aspects of a question, one that raises deep concern among communities along the Great Lakes who do not want to see waters of the Great Lakes pumped west to quaff the thirst of arid western States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, there was a proposal for a coal slurry pipeline to bring coal in a slurry pipeline from the Powder River Basin to the western end of Lake Superior to ports of Duluth and Superior; and we vigorously opposed it, because that pipeline, if it pumps east, can also pump west and could suck water out of the Great Lakes in vast amounts.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, subsequently, in a Water Resources Development Act, I succeeded with legislation to prohibit any withdrawals from the Great Lakes unless there is unanimous agreement among the eight Governors and the Province of Quebec and the Province of Ontario. That language is current law, but it is not strong enough. It really needs to be reinforced. Now that I am in a position to do that, we are going to reinforce it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second concern of the gentleman is private companies profiting from the public sector provision of water supplies, and I think we should find a way in which we can limit the profiteering while not interfering with private sector developments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>For example, the little town of Buhl, population 900 in my district, has on its water tank the slogan, "The Finest Water in America," and the city began bottling that water for sale. They are using their open resources to bottle this water in these little 8-ounce and 16-ounce bottles. I wouldn't want to prevent Buhl, which has fallen on hard times, from drawing on its resources. But they are using their own money to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the gentleman is concerned about is a public, federally funded process that might stimulate the private sector. I commend the gentleman for his concern, and we shall work together to address the situation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman for his comments and his dedication to the public good. I look forward to working with you on this to protect public water supplies and to protect the public's right to access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise with a very simple amendment, an amendment of responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you and the House know, <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> grants $125 million for alternative water source projects. It is a program that Congress has never funded, may be a very appropriate program. For some in this Chamber, $125 million may not be very much money, but for folks in my district, and I suspect for folks around this Nation, $125 million is a lot of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And, again, while what this bill does may be very important, it is important that we also make a statement for financial responsibility. This amendment would apply the principle of pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-go to any new spending that would be authorized in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very simple: If you are going to spend money for this project, you ought to make it a priority and identify an area where you desire to take that money from in order to pay for this project. It is a concept that has been embraced by many in this Chamber. In fact, many Members on the majority side embraced the pay-as-you-go project in their campaigns this past year. In fact, the New Direction for America, which was proposed by the majority party in the 109th Congress, says, "Our new direction  is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting. No more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I agree with that. It is a wise idea. We ought to follow that. We ought to follow that in this new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I would respectfully suggest that, unless adopted, then the new direction in which we are heading is one that will take us in a direction of greater red ink and not that of financial responsibility. So I offer this simple amendment, this PAYGO amendment to <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, and I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the fashion of the gentleman from Georgia, and I respect his consistency. He offered the same amendment yesterday. We had quite a thorough and extensive discussion and a recorded vote, which ended 166-260.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I appeal to the gentleman, Mr. Chairman, that we are dealing with an authorization. Tomorrow we will be dealing with a different bill that does result in a direct spending reduction as determined by the Congressional Budget Office and for which the committee created an offset and reduced the size of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, is not a direct spending bill, and has been so verified by the Congressional Budget Office and by the Office of Management and Budget. It is not subject to the so-called PAYGO rules. An appropriation subsequently could well be subject to PAYGO, but we have yet before us the congressional budget process. We have to vote on a budget, and then we consider the appropriations. If this legislation is enacted in time for the appropriation process, hopefully it could be considered  and included, and then there is a question of whether it is subjected to the PAYGO rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in its present form, this is an authorization. It is not a direct spending. It is not subject, as Congressional Budget Office has ruled, to the PAYGO rules. And we made that point yesterday. We make it again today. And I rise in opposition to the amendment, but not in opposition to the approach of the gentleman, who is a true fiscal conservative and wants to ensure that dollars are wisely spent and that we are not overspending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I assure the gentleman, this legislation, modest as it is in its scope of dollars authorized, will be subjected to the  rigorous oversight of OMB, Congressional Budget Office, procedure and the appropriation process in its new course.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price), almost to say the same thing we said yesterday: He has gotten the appropriations mixed up with the authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an authorization committee, and actual funding of these programs through the appropriations process, which is where this will be more appropriate. A similar manner it was offered yesterday, as we said, to <bill type="h" number="569">H.R. 569</bill>, the Water Quality Investment Act, and was defeated by 166-260.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would require that any authorization of appropriations be considered with corresponding offsets regardless of whether the program ever receives any funding. It is possible that it won't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the example of the Alternative Water Source pilot program under consideration today, a program that again has never been funded through the appropriations process, this amendment would require the identification of $125 million in offsets, regardless of whether appropriations are ever enacted for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the first few days of the legislative session, the new Democratic majority renewed the PAYGO rules to require the identification of offsets to any changes in direct spending by legislative initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has no effect on direct spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office in its analysis of the bill, enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues. Therefore, the offset requirements of PAYGO are never triggered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also remind my colleagues that the PAYGO provision was allowed to expire under Republican control of the House, with no attempt by the former Republican leadership to restore its protections to the Federal budgetary process. To now claim to be the champions of fiscal responsibility and attempt to hold Congress to stricter budgetary principles than instituted under their own leadership is a fairly hollow argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman's amendment would require offsets for any authorization of appropriations, regardless of its impact on Federal receipts. Were the gentleman's amendment adopted, my expectation is that every authorization of appropriations, whether it be for clean water, safer schools, better health care, or national defense, would require equal offsets. This is an inappropriate limitation on the ability of Congress to address the needs of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fiscal responsibility is a noble cause, but not at the cost of hindering Congress's ability to meet the needs of our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word, and I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding. I will be very brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to point a couple points of clarification. And I appreciate the gentlewoman from Texas and her comments, but she did say that this amendment would require finding $120 million of offsets somewhere else, regardless of whether there was any money that was ever authorized for this particular grant project. In fact, that is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On line 4 of the amendment, it says that, "any other provision that results in costs to the Federal Government." So it would require that the Congress had determined that, yes, there should be money spent for these grant projects, and then the equal amount of offset money would need to be found.</paragraph>

It is a matter of principle, and it is a matter of making the statement now that we believe that, if we are going to spend money for this project and we believe that it is a priority, that we ought to find the money elsewhere in order to cover that so that we do not increase the deficit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.</paragraph>

  <chair> Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill> follows an authorization that the Republican Congress provided for in the year 2000, which authorized $75 million in grants for alternative water source projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We learned that the population growth was causing a number of communities to have to explore alternative supplies through reclamation, reuse and conservation. And so Congress created section 220 of the Clean Water Act. This amendment to the Clean Water Act required a 50 percent non-Federal cost share. And it expired in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's legislation doubles this authorization, but the troubling part to me is it allows this authorization to continue indefinitely. So if this legislation passes, there will be no sunset, no further oversight and no review of the effectiveness of these grants. My amendment would provide for the expiration of this authorization in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is fiscally responsible and allows Congress to reevaluate these grants, and not just leave them forever without oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I understand that the gentleman Mr. Oberstar would wish to engage with me in a colloquy on this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Texas, a member of the Rules Committee, and I had a discussion about the principle involved in the gentleman's amendment in the course of our presentation at the Rules Committee for the rule covering this bill. As a result, the gentleman has offered an amendment that I think is entirely appropriate. But the point at which we are in the consideration of the legislation, and given the time it might take for the other body to act on it, would create a time frame  problem through fiscal 2008. I would suggest that the language be changed to reflect two fiscal years from date of enactment, so that we have a precise time but that it is linked to date of enactment of the act, which then would be a very appropriate way to do it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for the past decade, within rural communities throughout the country, home water bills have increased faster than the rate of inflation, and it seems likely that this trend will continue. Currently, rural populations across America are being forced to comply with extremely costly regulations regarding standards that have been set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have rural constituents who are currently paying upwards of 770 percent more for water service than that of urban populations due to regulatory items and the inability to spread these costs over a wide basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As deregulations are implemented and aging infrastructures replaced, the affordability of water service in rural America will continue to be of great concern. Water systems, consumers, administrators and policy makers will need to focus on the ability of rural households to pay for public water service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not a solution to the underlying problem; it is a recognition of the issue and a step in the right direction. My amendment would simply add to the considerations for these grants recognition of water systems serving 10,000 people or less.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as water bills continue to rise larger, in the rural communities throughout the country home water bills have increased faster than the rate of inflation. Over 50,000 community water systems serve populations under 10,000. In North Carolina, 95 percent of our community water systems service populations of less than 10,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, rural populations across America are being forced to comply with costly regulations. At this time, many rural areas have a greater percentage of the poverty and lower mean household income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is imposing a major burden on the rural families of America. In the same rural communities, some citizens are now paying 770 percent more for the water services than that of urban populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conaway-Shuler amendment does not call for more money or strike existing language. This is a fiscally responsible approach which points us in the right direction to take some of the strain off of the rural communities as they struggle to provide safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both gentlemen offer an amendment, Mr. Chairman, to our bill that is well intentioned to respond to the needs of small communities, to assure that communities under a population of 10,000 are not left behind, as this program is administered. And I certainly am in consonance with that concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are only maybe four communities in my congressional district that have population greater than 10,000. I think of Big Fork, population 950, and others of similar size who have needs for water resource as great proportionately as do the major metropolitan areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in a drought in 1988, Minneapolis was trying to encourage the Corps of Engineers to draw down the head waters of the Mississippi River to increase the flow to Minneapolis while at the same time not banning car washes, not banning sprinkling of lawns, not taking other water conservation measures and also drawing water from the Jordan Basin Reservoir underneath the Twin Cities, a 50-mile diameter basin that is water left over from the melting of the glacier 10,000 years ago, water that  can never be replaced because it is an impermeable area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I said, oh, wait a minute. It just happened I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigation and Oversight; called the Corps of Engineers in and made sure they didn't draw any matter down from the head waters of the Mississippi River to serve the thirst of Minneapolis while at the same time St. Paul was incorporating water conservation measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I cite that history to show that I am really sensitive to these needs. But we do not want to create in this legislation a preferential consideration. And when the gentleman says consider, when the language of the amendment the gentlemen are offering says consider, I take this to mean a factor to be considered, along with other relevant factors and not a set-aside and not a preference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May I ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), and I yield to the gentleman, to be assured that he concurs in that interpretation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, sir. This goes into the part of the bill that talks about additional consideration. The administrator has wide leeway in how they grant these grants, and I would simply like in the Record, in the law, that this is one of the things that administrator should take into consideration. This in no way binds or ties their hands to any particular size of community or use but allows good judgment by the administrator and in recognition that rural America is outnumbered on this  floor. And having those words in this language will be particularly important to the constituents I serve who recognize that and understand that from time to time you guys have got us outnumbered. So it does not set up a preference, but it simply says, here is one other criteria to look at when you decide on these questions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. Let me ask the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler) whether he shares that viewpoint.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412225" topic="">
    <paragraph>I most certainly would. In rural America, they struggle so often. Although it is not binding, it doesn't cost any more; I would certainly like to see this in the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, when I was elected to Congress, took office in 1975, we formed a Congressional Rural Caucus. There were 250 members. We had a voice on this floor, and a presence on this floor. Today there are less than 90 of us representing primarily rural areas, so we do have to be watchful for small towns, rural areas.

  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer this motion to recommit. And I am more pleased to commend my Democratic colleagues for yesterday's recognition of the motion to recommit. They will recognize today's because it is exactly the same motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think with that recognition came the realization and appreciation that motions to recommit are, indeed, substantive moves and they are substantive proposals of policy by this House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit is one about honesty; it is about honesty in the provision of the funds in the bill that is about to be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit would reinforce existing Federal law by making it clear that none of the funds authorized under this act may be used to lobby or retain a lobbyist to attempt to influence Federal, State or local governmental officials. It would also expand upon existing law by specifically prohibiting Federal funds from being used to pay for membership in any association or organization. And, Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned yesterday, many of those dues rise to the sum of $48,000  to $50,000 or more. The funds should only be used for the purposes intended by Congress, namely, identifying alternative water source projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while associations and organizations provide meaningful opportunities for collaboration and knowledge dissemination, it would not be appropriate to use hard-earned scarce Federal tax dollars for such a purpose. Such a diversion of these funds would not only limit the amount of funds available for the actual use and construction of alternative water source projects, it could indeed constitute an end run around the lobbying restrictions since many of these associations engage in lobbying activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, Mr. Speaker, growth in population and increasing environmental awareness is causing many communities to explore alternative water supplies through reclamation, reuse and conservation. And while the Clean Water Act construction grants prior to 1991 and State revolving loan funds since 1989 have been available for such activities, most expenditures to date have been for more traditional wastewater projects and not for enhancing water supplies through wastewater reuse and water  recycling. For these compelling reasons, we need to ensure that all available resources provided through this reauthorization are used specifically for the purpose of building and improving alternative water source projects for municipal, industrial or agricultural uses in areas that are experiencing critical water supply needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize what they recognized yesterday, and that is that motions to recommit are substantive policy motions. I urge the adoption of this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
