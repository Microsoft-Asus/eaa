  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress has a responsibility to the American people and to our troops bravely serving our Nation in Iraq to debate the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today this House will begin debate on a bipartisan resolution supporting our troops and voicing disapproval with the President's plan. I want to say, Mr. Speaker, it really concerns me that some of the Republicans on the other side this morning talked about this debate as silly and tried to trivialize a debate that involves our troops who are fighting, some of whom are dying in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our own intelligence agencies released a report earlier this month saying that the war in Iraq is not a civil war, it is worse, with numerous groups killing each other to gain the upper hand. Four times before, the President has sent thousands of additional troops to Iraq, and each time the situation on the ground either remained the same or grew even more dangerous. Could that be why our generals concluded, before being let go by this President, that sending more troops to Iraq simply will not  help the situation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to ask the tough questions this week so we can begin taking our Iraq strategy in a new direction.</paragraph>
