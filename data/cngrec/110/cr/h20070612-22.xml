    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for months we have heard the Democrats' promises that they would make this the most transparent and ethical Congress that our Nation has ever seen, and of course, we all want to  see Congress held accountable. We all want the legislative process to be open and be accessible to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this week the Democrats get to take a swing at making good on their promises of transparency and accountability, and they're already striking out with their secret slush funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By deciding not to include any earmarks in the appropriation bills and instead to slip them in by the dark of night into conference reports, preventing anyone from questioning or challenging their earmarks, they have completely shut off the legislative process to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me make it clear that I am not against earmarks. I am more than willing to get up here on the floor and defend each and every earmark that I have ever gotten or tried to get for my district. And I think that all Members should have the opportunity to defend their projects and their requests, but more importantly, tax paying citizens have the right to know exactly how their hard-earned dollars are being spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make this process closed is an insult to taxpayers, and if Democrats have nothing to hide, they should live up to their promise and open the process back up to the American people and hold themselves accountable for their spending.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
