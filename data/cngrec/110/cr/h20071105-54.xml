  <narrative>THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12711]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a few thoughts as regarding the importance of National Bible Week as well. It has been thrilling to hear my colleagues from both sides of the aisle refer to the importance of Scripture, and especially encouraging to hear the distinguished Representative from Illinois (Mr. Rush), who represents the district I was born in. I appreciate the sincerity of your message this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a pastor in a previous life myself, I can unequivocally say that the Bible has deeply influenced my life every day in every way. Sadly, I haven't followed it every day in every way. But when it has been followed, it has influenced to the good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible is the best selling book of all time. It is a book that has touched countless numbers of lives. Along with being the main influence, many decisions have been made of by the billion, most importantly and most personally, my life and my faith in my Savior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1940, a group of business and professional leaders got together and founded the nonprofit, independent, educational National Bible Association. Their goal was to encourage Americans to read the Bible in every sector of society, regardless of religious or political distinction. Every year since 1941, the National Bible Association has sponsored National Bible Week as a time to remind us of the importance of the Bible in our daily life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's traditions lie in the principles set out in the Bible. In 1951, an amazing book was published by the National Education Association and it was entitled, "The American Citizens Handbook." The book's author and publisher said that "This volume should be in every home library and on every teacher's desk. It may well be used as a text or reference book in the schools," and it was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in that book, it had a grade-by-grade chart that included the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second graders were to memorize the Lord's prayer: "Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third graders were to memorize Psalm 23: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventh graders were to memorize the Beatitudes: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, the merciful, the hungry in spirit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ninth graders were to memorize Psalm 1, that beautiful Psalm that says, "Happy is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law he meditates day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth fruit in his season. His fruit shall not wither."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are principles that were put forth in this book. High school seniors were to memorize the entire chapter of Romans 12, which begins by saying, "I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those were patterned after the Founders of our country. Fifty-two of the 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence were deeply committed Christians, and the other three believed in a God who personally intervened in the lives of mankind. The same Continental Congress formed the American Bible Society, of all things, and purchased 20,000 copies of Scripture for the people of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patrick Henry's famous "give me liberty or give me death" speech actually  came at the end of this statement, where he said, "An appeal to arms and the God of hosts is all that is left us. But we shall not fight our battle alone. There is a just God that presides over the destinies of nations. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone. Is life so dear or peace so sweet to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, almighty God."  Patrick Henry understood the power and the content of Scripture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jonathan Whitherspoon, who was a minister and signed the Declaration of Independence, said "A republic, once equally poised, must either preserve its virtue or lose its liberty." Jonathan Whitherspoon knew that that virtue came from the Holy Scriptures, the Bible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Chamber and all the institutions of this great Republic are surrounded by images and phrases from Scripture. In this very Chamber is a portrait of Moses, the first lawgiver. The Supreme Court also holds several images of Moses. The south frieze prominently displays Moses holding Ten Commandments. In the Library of Congress stands a large statue of Moses alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul. The Great Reading Room of the Library is filled with Scriptures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, to be able to stand here in the Halls of Congress and to call attention to the impact of Biblical authority, what a great opportunity that is. I thank the God of Scripture for that opportunity, and I thank my colleagues for bringing this to the floor tonight.</paragraph>
