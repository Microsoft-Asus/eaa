  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1005">H. Res. 1005</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas borderline personality disorder (BPD) affects the regulation of emotion and afflicts approximately 2 percent of the general population;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas BPD is a leading cause of suicide, as an estimated 10 percent of individuals with this disorder take their own lives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas BPD usually manifests itself in adolescence and early adulthood;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas symptoms of BPD include self-injury; rage; substance abuse; destructive impulsiveness; a pattern of unstable emotions, self-image, and relationships; and may result in suicide;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas BPD is inheritable and is exacerbated by environmental factors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas official recognition of BPD is relatively new, and diagnosing it is often impeded by lack of awareness and frequent co-occurrence with other conditions, such as depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, anxiety, and eating disorders;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas despite its prevalence, enormous public health costs, and the devastating toll it takes on individuals, families, and communities, BPD only recently has begun to command the attention it requires;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it is essential to increase awareness of BPD among people suffering from this disorder, their families, mental health professionals, and the general public by promoting education, research, funding, early detection, and effective treatments; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder and the National Alliance on Mental Illness have requested that Congress designate May as Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month as a means of educating our Nation about this disorder, the needs of those suffering from it, and its consequences: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and ideals of Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1005">H. Res. 1005</bill>, as amended, which expresses support for greater recognition of the goals and ideals of Borderline Personality Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1005">H. Res. 1005</bill> was introduced by Representative TOM DAVIS of Virginia, a longstanding member and leader on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on February 27, 2008, and has the support and cosponsorship of over 50 Members of Congress. The measure was considered by the Oversight panel on March 13, 2008, and was passed by voice vote at that time after being amended for technical purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while many people may not be aware of borderline personality disorder, it is a mental illness that is more common than bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and has been found to affect a little over 2 percent of adults, particularly young women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BPD, as it is commonly referred to as, is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior. The instability caused by this illness often leads to disruptions in one's family and work life, long-term planning, and ultimately a person's sense of self-identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each and every one of us has a personality; however, for those individuals who suffer from personality traits that are inflexible, maladaptive, or psychologically disruptive, more research and awareness on borderline personality disorder is an absolute must. And that is why I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1005">H. Res. 1005</bill>. Passage of this measure will help to raise the profile and the general public's understanding of borderline personality disorder and the corresponding BPD month of awareness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Representative Davis from Virginia for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, mental illness affects Americans all across the Nation. It afflicts those of us from all races, colors, religions, and income levels. It doesn't wait for a convenient time to surface. It strikes indiscriminately, without regard to the challenges, pain, and anguish it visits upon the families and friends of its victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we recognize the struggle people with these afflictions endure as they strive for a normal life. It is equally important we recognize the struggles visited upon those friends and family members who have to cope with the disease and, often, the victim him or herself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this House will take an important step in raising awareness of a little known and often misunderstood mental illness. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the designation of May as Borderline Personality Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Borderline personality disorder is a devastating psychiatric disorder caused by the inability of the afflicted individual to manage emotions effectively. Symptoms of this disorder include impulsivity, mood swings, episodes of rage, bodily self-harm, chaotic relationships, and fear of abandonment. Some people with this disorder can't hold a job. Others are high functioning. But in any case their private lives are often in turmoil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 3 million American adults have borderline personality disorder. Twenty percent of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals have borderline personality disorder. Their victims have a suicide rate 400 times that of the general population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, these numbers call us to action. Although this disorder was officially recognized by the psychiatric community in 1980, studies have shown it lags far behind in research, treatment options, and family education compared to other psychiatric disorders of similar prevalence. With passage of <bill type="hr" number="1005">H. Res. 1005</bill>, this House will take an important step in spreading awareness of this disorder. Madam Speaker, the National Alliance on Mental Illness maintains a help line at 1-800-950-6264 for  general information on mental illness. This help line can help those in need of assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have sponsored this resolution and am greatly encouraged by our considering of it today. Passage of this will go a long way to increase awareness of its existence and the heavy toll this disorder takes on our society. I applaud the work the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the National Education Alliance on Borderline Personality Disorder have been doing throughout our Nation in this vital area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1005">H. Res. 1005</bill>, a resolution supporting the designation of May as Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month. I want to thank my colleague Tom Davis for his leadership on an issue that is very important to many Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental health illness that centers on the inability of people to manage their emotions effectively. Approximately 4 million Americans suffer from borderline personality disorder. Its symptoms include destructive impulsiveness, rage, marked shifts in mood, bodily self-harm,  chaotic relationships, fears of abandonment, substance abuse, and unstable self-identity. Although it was officially recognized in 1980  by the psychiatric community, borderline personality disorder is at least two decades behind in research, treatment options, and education compared to other major mental illnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Borderline personality disorder can have a devastating impact on people's lives. While some persons with this disorder may be functioning normally in certain settings, their private lives are often in turmoil. Others are unable to work and require financial support. If Americans would like more information on borderline personality disorder, I encourage them to visit the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder Web site at www.neabpd.org or the National Alliance on Mental  Illness Web site at www.nami.org.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this resolution acknowledges the pressing burden of those afflicted with borderline personality disorder and seeks to spread awareness of this under-recognized, and often misunderstood, mental illness. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
