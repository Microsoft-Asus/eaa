    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 320(c) of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 Budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation that extends the Transitional Medical Assistance program, so long as that legislation does not worsen the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that <bill type="s" number="1701">S. 1701</bill>, introduced today by Senator Baucus, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for Transitional Medical Assistance. Therefore, pursuant to section 320(c), I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
