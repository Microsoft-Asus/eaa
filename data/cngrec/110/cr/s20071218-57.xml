  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the Fort Campbell Varsity football team from Fort Campbell, KY. On December 8, 2007, the Fort Campbell High School Varsity football team won the Class 2-A State Championship in Louisville, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the young men on this team, this is not just a trophy; it is an affirmation that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. To accomplish this goal the members not only have to juggle long practices and games, but they continue to achieve academic excellence. Not only are these young men excellent athletes and students, but they pride themselves in giving back to their community for all the support they have received by doing community service, fundraising, and school public  relations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Campbell, KY, is proud to be home to the 101st Airborne Division and 160th Special Operations Airborne Division. Many of the players on the Fort Campbell Falcons have loved ones currently serving our Nation abroad. I am confident that these loved ones would be proud of what the Falcons have accomplished this season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The citizens of Fort Campbell, KY, are fortunate to have the 2007 Class 2-A State Champions and families living and learning in their community. Their example of hard work and determination should be followed by all in the Commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of the accomplishments these young men have made. I would like to congratulate the members of the Fort Campbell High School Varsity football team for their success. But, also, I want to congratulate their peers, coaches, teachers, administrators, and dedicated parents for the support and sacrifices they have made to help the Fort Campbell High School football team make their dreams a reality.</paragraph>
