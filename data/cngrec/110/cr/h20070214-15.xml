  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know where we stand on the President's troop escalation plan, and this week every Member of this House will have an opportunity to explain why he or she supports or opposes President Bush's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution that we are debating this week is a straightforward two-page bill. First, it highlights our continued support for our troops in Iraq. And second, it voices opposition to the President's troop increase plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people don't want Congress to continue to shirk from its responsibility to oversee the Bush administration's implementation of this war. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened in the Senate, where a bipartisan resolution opposing the President's troop escalation plan is being kept hostage from the Senate floor by Republicans who seem content to allow the President to conduct this war any way he sees fit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people have unequivocally called on Congress to discuss this situation in Iraq and to take action to change our course there. Here in this House, we have begun the process this week.</paragraph>
