  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 22, 2002, in San Francisco, CA, Jack Broughton and his female companion, Jean Earl, beat two women outside a gay poetry event. Police reported that Earl began kicking and punching people while shouting anti-gay epithets at the event's participants. After being kicked out, Broughton and Earl beat a 34-year-old woman outside. Broughton then punched the first victim's partner, who joined in the scuffle. The first victim suffered minor injuries, for which she was treated at a hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to reports, the victim's were attacked solely because of their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
