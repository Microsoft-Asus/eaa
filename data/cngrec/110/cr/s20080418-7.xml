  <narrative>COMMEMORATING EARTH DAY -- (Senate - April 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3172">S3172</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 38 years ago, Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin founded Earth Day to celebrate the environment and to call attention to the major environmental issues of the time. Once again we celebrate the progress we have made to protect our environment, and are again called upon to address new challenges facing our planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Earth Day's conception in 1970 our Nation has worked to reduce pollution and clean up lakes, streams, and the air we breathe. These environmental accomplishments have made us healthier, our economy prosper, and have helped to make America even more beautiful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we have made great strides to improve and protect our environment, it is clear that we are facing one of the gravest environmental challenges of our time. Global warming from man-made greenhouse gas emissions may be the most complicated crisis our world has ever faced. We must address it quickly and boldly in the United States and assert global leadership on this most important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rising temperatures threaten to devastate western landscapes, intensify drought, and magnify summer heat waves. Fortunately, if we act swiftly, we still have a narrow window of time and opportunity to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the next 15 years, I am confident that we can reduce emissions by at least 25 percent. We will establish a framework for capping greenhouse gas emissions without imposing economic hardship on Americans. We will also create a business environment that provides ample incentives to phase out rapidly our current outdated 19th century energy production and decisionmaking methods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Global warming is an enormous opportunity wrapped in a complex challenge. On this Earth Day, I want Nevadans and all Americans to embrace and prepare for the challenge, and recognize the tremendous opportunity we have to improve our energy security, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and develop the new, clean, efficiency and renewable energy economy of the future. With the right investments and political will, we can soon power all our cars, homes and industry with power from the Sun,  the wind, and the Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a 100-mile-square area of Nevada and the Southwest's desert, we have enough solar energy resources to supply the entire United States with electricity. This might seem unreal today because our thinking is shaped most by those who profit from selling us fossil fuels. But, solar technologies at the utility-scale and in distributed applications are quickly becoming economical and have far far fewer of the hidden costs of coal, nuclear and other unsustainable resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we have vast wind and geothermal resources that America has only begun to tap. By expanding and improving transmission access to rural and undeveloped areas where solar, wind and geothermal are often most plentiful, our renewable energy resources can work in affordable harmony, improving our energy security and reliability, using cost-free fuel for ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a speech I gave earlier this year, I established five policy goals to promote renewable energy. These principles will help launch Nevada and the nation in a new direction that chooses ingenuity over stagnation, progress over pollution. They include: consumer choice--allowing consumers to choose renewable energy to power their homes at reasonable cost; consumer empowerment--allowing homeowners to receive credit for generating their own renewable electricity; making space for renewables--setting  aside federal land for renewable energy production; investment--providing incentives to utility companies to choose renewables and efficiency over fossil fuels; and electric cars--building a smart grid that can charge electric automobiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Achieving these policy goals could help make our nation more sustainable, both environmentally and economically. They are some of the necessary steps we must take toward a low-carbon economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Climate scientists tell us that the countries of the world have approximately 10-15 years to radically transform the way that energy is made and consumed because greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are  verging on dangerous interference with the global climate system. This means making tremendous reductions quickly and ensuring that our energy decisions today do not warp the future for our children and generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate Earth Day this year, I ask that you join me in thinking about the road ahead and how we will overcome this great environmental challenge that we face as Nevadans, Americans, and citizens of the world.</paragraph>
