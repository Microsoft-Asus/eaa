    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would hope that everyone understands we have a lot of balls in the air, and we are trying to grab a few of them to see if in the next few days we can work through some of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have AMT, which hasn't been completed. The farm bill and spending bills have to be completed. We have many different bills we are trying to complete. If everyone will be patient and speak to their heart's content, we will try to have something legislatively that we can work on.</paragraph>
