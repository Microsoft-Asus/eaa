  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate very much the senior Senator from Pennsylvania yielding to me. I know he is interested in getting these quality judges confirmed, and votes are taking place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have one coming up in a few minutes that happens to be for a close personal friend of mine, a judge in Oklahoma, Greg Frizzell. I would like to make a couple of comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we thought he would be confirmed before the end of last year, and it didn't work out. There was bickering going on that had nothing to do with him but with other judges. Fortunately, over the last few weeks, I have had a chance to talk to colleagues on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to single out Senator Pat Leahy for being so generous with me and giving me time to talk about Judge Frizzell and why he should be confirmed. He told me, after listening to this, he would be willing to put him on his top priority list. He didn't have to do it. He is a Democrat and I am a Republican. So, again, I compliment Senator Pat Leahy for doing that for us and for justice in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This young man, Greg Frizzell, has a great family background. I remember when his daddy, Kent Frizzell, was in Kansas and served as attorney general for that State. Then he had better judgment and decided to move from Kansas to Oklahoma. We became good friends many years ago. Greg was very young at that time. He was raised in this family of public servants, people who served as his father had for such a long period of time. I think his father is still at the University of Tulsa Law School and  has been for about 20 years and is doing great work. That is the environment in which Greg Frizzell was raised. He has been a judge for a long time, and you would think you would hear some negative things about him. But you don't hear negative things about this guy. Even his political adversaries all agree that he is the quality and type of man who should be on the Federal bench.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert Sartin, a member of the Board of Governors, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Frizzell is a man of extremely good character and high integrity, with a deep sense of personal responsibility toward his fellow man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A fellow judge, Claire Egan, praised him. She talked about the urgency of this confirmation and that they actually only have three judges now on that bench doing the work of six judges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most highly respected senior Federal judges, Ralph Thompson, who is in senior status in Oklahoma right now, praised Greg, saying there is nobody out there who could be more qualified than Greg Frizzell for this particular appointment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is neat that we are finally getting around to this. I apologize to Greg and his family for the uncertainty that is always there, even though I never had any uncertainty. I knew he was going to be there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Getting back again to all these different people, Joe Wolgemuth, a prominent attorney in Tulsa, recalls an incident where Judge Frizzell--he has six kids, by the way--had work to do one night, and he went down and took his six kids with him and did his judicial work. Anybody who can juggle six kids and do his job at the same time I know is qualified for this job. I am thrilled that just in a matter of minutes we will be able to vote to confirm Judge Frizzell to the Northern District of Oklahoma.  He will be a great judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="JUDGE GREGORY KENT FRIZZELL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for those comments. He may be interested to know that I have been advised that the nominee is the son of Kent Frizzell, who was a high school debater in Kansas in my era. I debated against Kent Frizzell. I also noted that the nominee was born in Wichita, KS, which is a good place to be born, because I was born there, too. It is sometimes the source of some levity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was one of the assistant counsels to the Warren Commission, a man named Frances W. Adams, a prominent Wall Street lawyer, noted on my resume that I was born in Wichita. He said: Where was your mother on her way to at the time? When I say the birth place of Greg Frizzell, the nominee, is Wichita, KS, I recollect my own birth place and recollect the connection I had with his father being my high school debating opponent many years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have the floor, I know the time has been reserved to talk about judges in just a few minutes. Having started on Gregory Kent Frizzell, I would like to make a few additional comments. Senator Leahy is due to be here in a few minutes to speak--about three nominees. Votes are scheduled to take place at 11:55.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to supplement what has been said about Gregory Kent Frizzell. He has an outstanding academic record. He graduated from Tulsa University in 1981 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1984. He was an Oklahoma Rhodes Scholar finalist in 1980. He has been rated unanimously "well qualified" by the American Bar Association. I believe there is no opposition to his nomination for U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Oklahoma. I urge my colleagues to support him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that his r&amp;#233;sum&amp;#233; be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="JUDGE LAWRENCE JOSEPH O'NEILL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, further, I support the confirmation of Judge Lawrence Joseph O'Neill to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of California. He, too, has an excellent academic record, with a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1973, an MBA from Golden Gate University in 1976, and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. He has a distinguished professional record. The American Bar Association rated him unanimously</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="JUDGE VALERIE L. BAKER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the third nominee up for a vote at 11:55 is Judge Valerie L. Baker. She is nominated for U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Her academic record, as well, is outstanding: summa cum laude from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1971, with a cum laude master's degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1972, and with a law degree in 1975 from the UCLA School of Law. The American Bar Association unanimously rates Judge  Baker "well qualified."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for these three distinguished nominees. I thank Senator Leahy, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for moving these nominations. It is very important. We have numerous judicial emergencies. We have other nominees awaiting action by the committee and by the full Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Leahy is moving with dispatch, which is appreciated, and it is also appreciated that the majority leader has listed these three nominees for action this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="JUDGE GREGORY KENT FRIZZELL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor to follow up on the comments made by my senior Senator, Mr. Inhofe, from Oklahoma, on the qualifications of Judge Gregory Frizzell. He has enumerated many of those. This is a fine young man with impeccable character and integrity. He is a living example of a life of service, not just in what he does as a judge in Oklahoma, but what he does in his community in Oklahoma. It has been a real pleasure to get to know him, to also watch him as  he went through the process of getting a unanimous vote out of the Judiciary Committee and having no significant questions raised about his judicial philosophy, integrity, character, background, or his qualifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I look forward to his vote today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might comment for a moment that he was capable of being confirmed in the last Congress, and there was no reason, no good reason why he wasn't, other than the answer: We are not going to approve any more judges in this Congress. That is the reason I was told by the now majority leader that he would not be approved. There is no question as to his qualifications, but it should remind us again of the dangers of partisanship for party instead of partisanship for our country and for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very thankful to the Judiciary Committee chairman, Patrick Leahy from Vermont, for the speed and quickness with which he has brought this to the floor. I thank him for that, and I look forward to working with him with the same speed on any other judges the President might bring up and that the committee would put out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope we can get beyond partisanship on judiciary nominees and get to the business of filling the significant number of voids or vacancies that are out there today and that are limiting justice for people in this country. Justice delayed is justice denied. And a lack of available judges is denying justice to hundreds and thousands of Americans every day. So the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has my commitment as a member of the Judiciary Committee to help him in any way I can to  move those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great honor that Greg Frizzell will sit as a Federal judge in the northern district of Oklahoma, and it is my hope we will see many like him fill the spots across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
