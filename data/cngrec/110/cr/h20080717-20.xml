    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have been on the House floor asking the majority party if they've been hearing from the citizens about their financial struggles with high gas prices because I have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, I mailed a survey to families in my district asking for their comments about the energy crisis. I wanted to hear from them about their opinions, their ideas of what we, as Members of Congress, should be doing to ease the high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the survey I sent to these citizens, we had tremendous responses: some things like find alternatives to oil; move the country beyond that; we need to support conservative changes in lifestyle; waste less; we have to change; develop new technologies, to get us off oil; drill now; drill everywhere; encourage automakers to make vehicles not powered by gasoline. Yeah. They're right. We need to do it all, and we need to do it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is the majority party not hearing what I'm hearing? Worse, if they are, are they not choosing to help these people and bring energy legislation to the floor?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need energy legislation on the floor, and we need it now.</paragraph>
