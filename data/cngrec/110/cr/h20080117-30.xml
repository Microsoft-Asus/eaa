  <narrative>EARMARK REFORM -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H335]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have always been fortunate to have in this body of legislators Members who, for lack of a better term, are called "institutionalists." These are Members on both sides of the aisle who understand and appreciate the fact that this institution will outlive all of us and that we should try to ensure that when we leave the Congress, we leave the institution better than we found it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we desperately need these institutionalists to stand up today and play a role in reforming the practice of earmarking that is beneath the dignity of this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is almost a daily occurrence that we wake up to newspaper articles detailing questionable earmarks that coincide with large campaign contributions, earmarks that face little or no scrutiny in this body, earmarks that were more intended to garner votes or contributions than to address legitimate needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also seen little inclination on the part of those currently in the  position of leadership on either side of the aisle to address this issue in a meaningful way. We have changed the parties in charge, but we haven't changed the practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the mantle falls on the institutionalists among us to foster this change, those who deep down know that we owe more to this institution than we are giving it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to stand up and be counted.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
